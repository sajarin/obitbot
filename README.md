# ObitBot 

_Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb._

Obitbot is a web scraper that scrapes obituaries from universities like MIT, Harvard and UChicago. Since we all "stand on the shoulder of giants," The idea was to create a dataset of obituaries of such titan-like figures. The dataset serves as a necessary first step to realizing Obite, a future mailing list/bot that emails individuals with a few obituaries everyday. This idea comes from Austin Kleon's book Show Your Work, where Kleon details his method of reading obituaries for inspiration. As a programmer, why not automate that process and scale it for the masses?

If you have any suggestions for how to improve the dataset or the bot, please let me know!
