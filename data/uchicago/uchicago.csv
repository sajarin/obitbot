                    Shaoxiong ‘Dennis’ Zheng  SM’21  devoted scholar and friend  1997-2021            ,Editor’s note:A Chinese translation of this story is available here. 本文的中文翻译请点击这里Shaoxiong “Dennis” Zheng  a recent graduate of the University of Chicago master’s program in statistics  is being remembered by the UChicago community and friends as a passionate student and a generous friend.Zheng  SM’21  was shot and killed during a robbery in Hyde Park on Nov. 9. He was 24. The Universitywill hold a memorial serviceat 3 p.m. CT Nov. 18 at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel  which will be broadcast on theUChicago News website.“The entire University community is heartbroken ” said President Paul Alivisatosduring a Nov. 11 webinar.“In addition to being a University alum  he was a loving son and caring friend to many in our community and many more around the world ” added Provost Ka Yee C. Lee.Born in Sichuan Province  China  Zheng attended college at the University of Hong Kong. As a student in UChicago’s Department of Statistics  he used machine learning for inferring gene regulatory networks. He received his master’s degree this past June and wanted to be a data scientist  colleagues said.“He aspired to solve important problems facing our society  and to ‘help people to help more people ’” said Mei Wang  senior instructional professor at UChicago and director of the master’s program in statistics. “He was a passionate student and a curious scholar. He loved the atmosphere of the University—the way that everyone in the department was equally open to debating processes of reasoning and statistical methods.”“Dennis was a bright and talented student  who was dedicated in his pursuit of knowledge ” said Prof. Dan Nicolae  chair of the Department of Statistics  who collaborated with Zheng on his research thesis. “He was not only a promising scholar but also a wonderful person  always willing to help other students. He will be missed by all who knew him.”Faculty and friends alike remembered Zheng for his ever-present smile  his constant optimism and thoughtfulness  and his willingness to help others. Nan Jiang  a close friend from high school  said Zheng always took time to encourage those around him. “Every time you asked him a question  he tried his best to help you. I think he spent a lot of time on that ” Jiang said. “No matter what  he always had an encouraging word. And I think that wasn’t just for me. It was everyone he has had contact with.”Outside of academics  he enjoyed traveling and cooking  as well as playing piano  squash and table tennis. Zheng was also interested in Chinese calligraphy and photography—though he was less captivated by the technical aspects of capturing images than the simple act of admiring the world’s beauty  his friends said.“He wanted to savor every moment of life ” said his girlfriend  Shirley Cai  a graduate student in political science. “The sky  the sunset  the stars—he just wanted to keep it.”“Meeting him was one of the most fortunate things that has ever happened to me ” she said. “I was so lucky to be with him. He was the kind of person I want to be.”Nicholas Jackson  Zheng’s friend and neighbor in Hyde Park  said Zheng was the first to welcome nearly everyone to their building  where they built a tradition of shared jokes. “I taught him a lot of bad English slang  and when I would tell him what the phrase meant  it was like a bomb of laughter had gone off ” Jackson said. “He and I were always laughing.”Jason Peng  who was a fellow student in the master’s program in statistics  said Zheng was “the most positive  optimistic and cheerful person I’ve ever met.” Now a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin  Peng remembered the way Zheng would devote himself wholeheartedly to whatever he did. “He would think about a concept or a problem for days ” Peng said. “He worked hard for the joy of learning and thinking  not for the grades.”Zheng’s dedication as a scholar extended beyond his own department. He also worked as a teaching assistant at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and Booth School of Business.Bruce Meyer  the McCormick Foundation Professor at Harris  praised the dedication  creativity and insight that Zheng brought as a TA for Meyer’s class on advanced statistics for data analysis. Zheng was “beloved” by the students  and even inspired several to reach out to Meyer about becoming teaching assistants themselves in the future.“Even a young person can have a lot of impact on others ” Meyer said. “He certainly did.”Zheng is survived by his mother  Rong Li; and father  Xiaodong Zheng.
                    Lauren Berlant  preeminent literary scholar and cultural theorist  1957–2021            ,Prof. Lauren Berlant  a world-renowned scholar who examined what sentimentality means in American culture for gender  sexuality and politics  died June 28 of a rare form of cancer. A beloved mentor and esteemed colleague who spent nearly four decades at the University of Chicago  Berlant was 63 years old.Remembered by colleagues for their immense pedagogical curiosity  their perceptive interpretations of American literature  politics and culture and their collaborative prowess  Berlant gave readers the tools for understanding the complicated interactions between self and society.The George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of English Language and Literature  Berlant was a leading theorist whose impact stretched across disciplinary lines. They sought to define the desires and emotions that compel people to create forms of life that support a sense of belonging  and the complex ways in which gender  race  citizenship  class and sexuality affect and mold those attachments.Berlant’s award-winning book Cruel Optimism(2011)  analyzed the devices that affect everyday human connections  and how the culturally conditioned material regard for the perfect life compels human beings to act against their own best interests.“Lauren Berlant’s pathbreaking scholarship defined the fields of affect theory  heteronormativity and queer theory ” said Anne Walters Robertson  dean of the Division of the Humanities. “Their influence on generations of graduate students and colleagues was vast  and they will be profoundly missed.”Beloved as a mentor  Berlant championed generations of students and colleagues. One was Laurie Shannon  PhD’96  who was a student in Berlant’s first class at UChicago and remained friends with Berlant for more than 37 years.“Walking along North Avenue one January and analyzing some dilemma or other together  Lauren observed: ‘Poor everyone ’” said Shannon  the Franklyn Bliss Snyder Professor of English Literature at Northwestern University. “I hope these two words from Lauren capture the rangy magnanimity of their work on affect and attachment  of Lauren’s lion-hearted practice of friendship  and of a measureless contribution to the progress of so many thinkers—and feelers—around the world. Now we are poorer. But Lauren’s thought is our legacy; it teaches us that the best way to live/think/feel loss is always through love.”Berlant took special satisfaction in working with others.In a 2019 interview  Berlant described collaboration as a “super-intensified version of teaching.”“There’s the complete joy of the ‘not me ’” Berlant said. “Seeing somebody else at work  seeing somebody else’s generativity and seeing how  together  you can compose things that neither of you could have done by yourself.”
                    Nadia Ezaldein  fourth-year College student  1992-2014            ,When fellow College students describe Nadia Ezaldein  they recall a caring young woman who showered kindness on others.“She had a thoughtfulness that was unmatched ” said Rachel Silver  AB’13  a close friend and classmate. “She was innately perceptive of the people around her and made you feel safe and at home in her presence.”Ezaldein  22  died Nov. 29 of injuries suffered in a shooting incident at a downtown Chicago department store where she worked. The fourth-year was majoring in English language and literature.“This is heart-rending news  and we extend our deepest sympathies to her family and friends ” Karen Warren Coleman  Vice President for Campus Life and Student Services  wrote in a statement issued Nov. 30 to UChicago students. “Nadia and her whole family will be in the thoughts of many of us during this time.”In a statement provided to the University  Ezaldein’s family thanked the UChicago community for honoring her memory  saying it was a reminder of “why she loved her experience as a student at University of Chicago so much  along with the considerable impact her friends and faculty mentors had on her time there.”“Words cannot describe the type of person Nadia was in our memory ” the family’s statement said. “She was selfless in nearly every sense of that word.”Her family said one of Ezaldein’s big decisions when she enrolled in the College in 2009 was choosing between studying science or the humanities. She decided that she eventually wanted to pursue social justice and law.Ezaldein’s first-year roommate Meher Kairon  AB’13  who came to Chicago from India  remembers how Ezaldein welcomed her. “She made our little room in [Max Palevsky Residence Hall] feel like a home away from home ” Kairon said. “She was always ready with a smile  a story and some sass. She refused to let me feel homesick.”Kairon said Ezaldein once stayed up with her late into the night to bake an elaborate cake for someone  “just because she wanted to make them feel special.” Ezaldein’s family said that was not a rare gesture  noting that when they spoke with her late at night  she often was busy proofreading essays and papers for her friends or family members.“We would plead with her to stop so she could get some sleep for herself ” the family wrote.Ezaldein also is remembered for her commitment to tutoring neighborhood children  and a sense of ebullience that friends said would fill the room. She was always ready for an impromptu snowball fight or an adventure around campus.“Nadia had a way to make people feel special and feel loved ” said Emily Yuan  AB’13. “When you make someone feel special and loved  they learn to love themselves a lot more.”Ezaldein’s family wrote that she had an ability to “view people as the best versions of themselves.”“We hope that her example is one that is shared and remembered ” the family wrote  “and that those who have listened to her story are spurred to achieve closer connections with family and closest friends than ever before.”The Ezaldein family held a private funeral service.
                    Michael R. Sosin  AB’72  SSA scholar committed to social justice  1950-2014            ,Michael R. Sosin  the Emily Klein Gidwitz Professor at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration  died Nov. 25 after an extended illness. He was 64.Sosin served on the faculty at SSA for 26 years and was a longtime member of the UChicago community  having earned his bachelor’s degree in sociology in the College in 1972. Sosin conducted widely influential research on the problems of homelessness  substance abuse services and urban poverty  and he held a special interest in the relationship between social institutions and disadvantaged clients.“Mike cared deeply for the most marginalized and disadvantaged in society  and I think this concern motivated his insistence on rigorous scientific inquiry in social work and social welfare ” said Assoc. Prof. Julia Henly. “He was brilliant and had extremely high standards of scholarship. I don't know that most of us could ever live up to his standards  but his mentorship has motivated many of us to do our best.”One of the hallmarks of Sosin’s career  representing a major contribution to the profession  was his role serving as editor ofSocial Service Review  the oldest and most highly regarded scholarly journal in the profession. During his tenure as editor ofSSRfrom 1998 through 2014  he led major advances to the journal  including enlisting an external review board  editing manuscripts electronically and making all issues  starting from the first volume in 1927  accessible online.Many on the faculty remember Sosin as a mentor  particularly during their early careers. “Michael would help you see your possibility  your promise ” said Assoc. Prof. Susan Lambert  the current editor ofSSR. “He took your work as seriously as he took his own  and he was willing to invest his time and his substantial intellectual prowess in helping you improve your work. He was never patronizing  was always willing to explain what he knew in a matter-of-fact manner and was happy to learn from others. These qualities made him such a good mentor to doctoral students and junior faculty  as well as a good editor ofSocial Service Review.”“Michael was especially valued for his deeply thoughtful and incisive mind ” said Neil Guterman  dean of SSA and the Mose & Sylvia Firestone Professor. “He was committed to those most deeply disadvantaged  as well as to the high standards in his own social welfare scholarship and in his role as editor ofSocial Service Review. He was a colleague and friend  and he will be sorely missed in the SSA community.”Sosin joined the SSA faculty as a professor in 1988  after serving as a scholar in residence at SSA from 1986 to 1987. He was named the Emily Klein Gidwitz Professor in 1997. Sosin was also an affiliate of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an affiliate at UChicago’s Population Research Center.Assoc. Prof. Yoonsun Choi also remembered  “Mike was an incredible mentor to me and many others. He was an exemplary scholar of excellence  integrity and was committed to social justice. Personally  I greatly benefited and learned from his advice and wisdom in matters of research and career decisions. Mike also fostered independent thinking and opinion  and I felt safe to disagree with him.”Sosin is survived by his sister Sybil and several cousins. Funeral services already were held.
                    Mike Nichols  X’53  director and improv comedy pioneer  1931-2014            ,Mike Nichols  X’53  a satirist whose caustic wit led him to Broadway and Hollywood success with films includingThe Graduate  died Nov. 19  according to news reports. He was 83.Long before Nichols became one of the few people to win Emmy  Grammy  Oscar and Tony awards  and even before he joined the famed Compass Players  he was a 17-year-old pre-med student at the University of Chicago who fell in love with the intellectual and bohemian atmosphere of Hyde Park in the 1950s.For the first time in his young life  Nichols felt at home. “Everything was wide open  everybody was strange at the University of Chicago! It was paradise ” he told theNew York Timesin 1984. “I began to see there was a world that I could fit in.”He dropped out of school in the middle of his second year  and began to mingle with a ragtag group of theater artists including Shelley Berman  Severn Darden  X’50  Andrew Duncan  Barbara Harris  David Shepherd and Paul Sills  AB’51  who had begun to experiment with improvisation. In one early workshop  Nichols participated in an entirely improvised adaption of Thomas Mann’s novelThe Magic Mountain.Among this group of eccentrics was Elaine May  who had hitchhiked across the country to study at the University of Chicago. She never bothered to formally enroll  but still managed to be a source of mischief in University classes—at one point  May sat in on a philosophy class and insisted that Socrates was drunk in Plato’sSymposium.Sills introduced Nichols and May  telling May  “I want you to meet the only other person on the campus of the University of Chicago who is as hostile as you are.” The two shared a quick wit  dark sensibility and Jewish heritage that influenced much of their comedy. Their immediate creative spark grew into a decades-long friendship.Nichols and May first collaborated as members of The Compass Players  the pioneering improvisation and sketch comedy group founded by Sills and Shepherd. The group  which later spawned Chicago’s Second City theater  performed at the Compass Tavern at 55th Street and University Avenue. The performers used an innovative hybrid of ad-libbed and scripted material  much of it focused on political and social issues of the day.Through the Compass  Nichols and May improvised many of the scenes that would be included in their Broadway hit “An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May.” The recording of that production earned Nichols a Grammy.The duo specialized in comedy that highlighted human foibles and satirized contemporary culture. In one famous sketch  a mother berated her rocket scientist son for not calling more. In another  a grieving Nichols learned that a funeral home’s $65 special did not include any “extras.” “What kind of extras?” Nichols asked. “Well  how about a casket?” May responded.“People always thought we were making fun of other people when we were in fact making fun of ourselves ” Nichols told the Associated Press in 1997.Despite the enormous success of “An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May ” the pair parted ways at the peak of their popularity. Nichols began directing in the 1960s with a production of Neil Simon’sBarefoot in the Park  for which he won a Tony. He ventured into film withWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? andThe Graduate. He later directedHeartburn Primary Colors  and HBO’s landmark adaptation ofAngels in America.The range of subjects and tones Nichols tackled in his career never troubled him. “I never understand when people say  ‘Do you do comedy or tragedy?’ I don't think they're very much different ” he wrote in theHollywood Reporter. “They both have to be true  and there isn't a great play in the world that doesn't have funny parts to it—asSalesmandoes  asKing Leardoes. The whole idea is to reflect life in some way  which means surely you have to have both.”
                    Donald F. Steiner  SM’56  MD’56  pioneer of research on diabetes and insulin  1930-2014            ,Donald F. Steiner  a pioneer whose research improved lives for millions of diabetic patients worldwide  died Nov. 11 at his home in Chicago. A member of the UChicago faculty since 1960  he was 84.Steiner  SM’56  MD’56  the A.N. Pritzker Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Medicine and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology  revolutionized thinking about how the body produces insulin. In 1967  he showed that insulin  thought to be made from two separate protein chains  began instead as a longer single chain  which he named proinsulin. Steiner showed a small interior part of that single long chain was sliced out  leaving behind the two connected A and B chains that together compose the insulin molecule.This fundamental discovery paved the way to understanding how other hormones  as well as neuropeptides in the brain and endocrine system  are made and processed. It established the field of protein-precursor processing. It also enabled the pharmaceutical industry to improve the purity of insulin preparations  leading to insulins that were less likely to provoke an immune response and paved the way for biosynthetic human insulin production.“This was a remarkable piece of work  a truly creative and ultimately beautiful set of experiments ” said diabetes specialist Arthur Rubenstein  who did postdoctoral training with Steiner and later served as chairman of medicine at the University of Chicago. “No one else at that time was thinking through such problems in the same way. He was in the upper echelons of innovative scientists of the era.”Steiner and Rubenstein found that the small part of proinsulin that was sliced away  which they labelled “C-peptide ” provided a useful independent indicator of insulin secretion. Circulating proinsulin is also useful for the diagnosis of insulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas. Working with RNA from the insulin gene  Steiner later discovered an even larger precursor of proinsulin  which he labelled preproinsulin.In 1987  working with Rubenstein and the late Howard S. Tager  Steiner described the first mutations in the insulin gene  now known as insulin Chicago. Such mutations—there are now more than 30—are associated with neonatal diabetes as well as other syndromes that combine mild diabetes and elevated circulating insulin or proinsulin. Working with colleagues in Japan  Steiner subsequently found the first mutation of the insulin receptor. He also contributed to important work on understanding how insulin binds to its receptor.The discovery of proinsulin is considered “one of the 10 most significant scientific achievements ever to occur in Chicago ” said Joseph Bass  professor and section chief of endocrinology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Don’s idea of a proinsulin radically changed our understanding of signaling peptides. His work was a critical step in the ultimate molecular cloning of this hormone. It is worth contemplating the many millions of people whose lives have been saved by the use of recombinant insulin.”‘The perfect mentor’Donald Frederick Steiner was born in Lima  Ohio  on July 15  1930. Colleagues said his small-town roots shaped his personality.“He grew up in a family with a strong belief in honesty  generosity and hard work ” said Rubenstein  who recently stepped down as dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “He respected everyone and never demonstrated an ulterior motive. That  and his scientific brilliance  made him the perfect mentor. He taught me how to do things and then gave me the credit for doing them. That’s one reason so many good people flocked to his lab  where he only made them better.”Steiner earned his BS in chemistry and zoology from the University of Cincinnati in 1952  followed by an MS in biochemistry and an MD from the University of Chicago in 1956. He completed his internship at King County Hospital in Seattle  followed by a residency and postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Washington. He was invited to return to the University of Chicago as an assistant professor of biochemistry in 1960. He rose quickly through the ranks  becoming professor in 1968 and department chairman in 1973.He served as director of the University of Chicago Diabetes-Endocrinology Center (1974-78)  as well as associate director (1977-81)  director (2000-04) and co-director (2004-14) of the University of Chicago Diabetes Research and Training Center. From 1985 to 2006 he was a senior investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Chicago.Steiner published more than 400 peer-reviewed papers  and his work has been cited by other researchers more than 10 000 times. He won dozens of prestigious national and international honors and awards  often several per year. These include the Lilly Award and the Banting Medal for Scientific Achievement from the American Diabetes Association  the Joslin Medal from the New England Diabetes Association  Israel’sWolf Prize  and  from Japan  the Manpei Suzuki International Prize for Diabetes Research—the largest financial award for diabetes research. This summer he was awarded the University of ChicagoAlumni Medal.Steiner was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1972  the National Academy of Sciences in 1973  and the American Philosophical Society  the United States’ oldest learned society  in 2004.“In addition to his seminal contributions to science  Don Steiner has had a profound impact at the University of Chicago  particularly on the diabetes program ” said diabetes specialist Kenneth Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division and Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago. “The broad implications of his discoveries of the pathways of insulin biosynthesis and secretion placed the University of Chicago at the forefront of diabetes research.”“We know a lot more about diabetes simply because of him ” said Louis Philipson  director of the University of Chicago’s Kovler Diabetes Center. “He was an extraordinary mentor for so many people. He combined professional brilliance with the drive to solve hard problems and the capacity  once the job was done  to share the credit. He was a model of how science should be done and how a friend should behave.”Steiner also was an avid patron of the arts  especially the Chicago Symphony Orchestra  and helped support large and small theater companies and the opera  according to his cousin Steve Roess. He was a talented pianist and  in the late 1960s  meticulously assembled a harpsichord in his basement laboratory at the University. He also enjoyed sailing on Lake Michigan  and gardening at his lakeside Michigan cottage.Despite his accomplishments  Polonsky said Steiner was “an extraordinarily kind  gentle and attentive person.”“He always had time for his staff and colleagues  would answer questions at length and in depth  and was absolutely devoted to this University ” Polonsky said. “We miss him profoundly.”“He was an inspiration ” said Graeme Bell  the Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and Human Genetics at the University of Chicago. “We wanted to be like Don Steiner.”Steiner is survived by Ellen Steiner  the wife of his late brother Phares; by his niece Adrienne Steiner  his nephew Paul Steiner  several cousins and many  many friends.A memorial service is being planned.
                    Rory W. Childers  world-renowned heart disease expert  1931-2014            ,Rory Childers  an internationally known authority on the movement of electrical impulses within the heart and the use and interpretation of electrocardiograms  died Aug. 27 at Southampton Hospital in New York. The 83-year-old Chicagoan and his wife were vacationing when he suffered a cardiac arrest.A professor of medicine at the University of Chicago  Childers taught medical students  residents and fellows—and through his scholarly writings  physicians worldwide—how to gain the greatest possible information from an electrocardiogram  a two-dimensional graph showing the electrical currents moving through a beating heart. He published extensively on the interpretation of electrocardiograms. He helped computerize the diagnosis of disorders detected by this common test and was considered a pioneer in taking the diagnostic tool out of the hospital and into ambulances  allowing faster treatment for heart attack patients.“Rory Childers helped set the standards and bring uniformity to computerized interpretation of ECGs ” said Martin Burke  a cardiac electrophysiologist at the University.“An electrocardiogram is a very sensitive test ” Burke said. “It is routinely performed hundreds of times a day in every hospital around the world  but reading one is far from routine. The details matter. One little squiggle can alter a diagnosis. Rory was the expert on those details  especially the subtle ones that warn of an impending catastrophe.”Childers was known as the “ECG guy” to every medical student who attended the University of Chicago during the last 50 years.“In teaching cardiology and physical diagnosis  Rory had a magical combination of a thespian’s humor and scholarly precision that captivated multiple generations of students ” Burke saidChilders  who read an estimated 50 000 ECGs a year  was a core member of international teams assembled by the American Heart Association to standardize and update the interpretation of ECGs  bringing consistency to an array of imprecise and overlapping terms. Work from the project was published in a series of manuscripts between 2007 and 2009. In 2011  he was elected to a three-year term as president of the International Society of Computerized Electrocardiology.“People always looked up to him ” his colleague Lou Cohen  professor emeritus of medicine  recalled. “He earned their respect  their confidence and their friendship. He was so accomplished at what he did.”“Rory also created a wonderful atmosphere for learning ” Cohen said. “He had an unlimited supply of on- and off-color stories about cardiology and its practitioners  which he freely shared. No one disliked him; I don’t know how he managed that.”Roderick (Rory) Winthrop Childers was born June 2  1931  in Paris  France. He came from a distinguished Anglo-Irish family with deep connections to literature and politics. His grandfather  Robert Erskine Childers  wrote the highly acclaimed novel The Riddle of the Sands  often called the first espionage novel. He later became an Irish nationalist  and in 1914 used his yachtAsgardto run guns for the Irish volunteers into Howth harbor. He was executed in 1922 during the Irish Civil War.His son  (Rory’s father) Erskine Hamilton Childers  entered Irish politics in the early 1950s and served in various cabinet positions for more than two decades. In 1973  he was elected the fourth president of Ireland.Rory Childers entered Trinity College  Dublin  in 1948. He earned his BA with honors in French and English literature in 1953. He continued his medical training at Trinity  with internships in medicine and surgery at hospitals in England and a residency at Royal City of Dublin Hospital in 1956  followed by a one-year fellowship in cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital. After one more year of training at Royal City of Dublin  he received his MD from Trinity in 1958.From 1959 until 1963  Childers ran two of the first cardiac catheterization laboratories in Dublin and was a lecturer in cardiac physiology at Trinity College. From 1960 to 1963 he ran the Irish research end of the Ireland–Boston Diet–Heart Study  the initial phase of which he designed  for the Harvard School of Public Health. During this period he made a trip to New York City to serve as best man at a friend’s wedding  where he met Michele Javsicas. Six months later they were married.They moved to Chicago in 1963  where he began as a cardiology fellow at the University of Chicago  working with Hans Hecht and Murray Rabinowitz  two leaders in the field. Childers joined the faculty in 1964 as an assistant professor of medicine. At UChicago he rose rapidly through the ranks  becoming an associate professor in 1969 and a professor in 1976. He taught continuously in the Medical School and served as executive director of the Heart Station for nearly 50 years.During his career  Childers published more than 100 papers and abstracts  primarily on electrocardiography. He lectured widely and received many honors  including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Electrophysiology Section at the University of California  San Francisco. He was such a popular teacher in the Pritzker School of Medicine that medical students perennially honored him. He won the Teacher-of-the-Year Award from the Cardiology Section so often that in 2005 they renamed it theRory Childers Teaching Award “in order ” according to Burke  “to give his colleagues a chance.”Friends and colleagues also appreciated Childers as an authority on modern Irish history and culture. He had been physician and friend to Brendan Behan  the well-known Irish novelist and poet. He spoke regularly to Chicago-based cultural groups and local media about Irish literature and culture  and appeared on Chicago’s National Public Radio station twice a year  on St Patrick’s Day and June 16  “Bloomsday ” to read from James Joyce’sUlysses.“Rory was a fount of knowledge about literature ” said Nicholas Rudall  professor emeritus of classics at the University of Chicago and founding director of the University’s Court Theatre. “In the 1970s he taught himself Russian so that he could read the works of Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova.” He published articles on both poets.“He could talk engagingly and amusingly about anything ” Rudall said. “He had good friends in all possible fields. With his passing  such a huge  deep hole is left.”Childers is survived by his wife Michele; son Peter Childers and wife Rani Gill  of Palo Alto  Calif.; and son Daniel Childers  of New York  N.Y.The funeral was held privately. A memorial service is being planned for 1-3 p.m. on Wednesday  Nov. 13  at the University of Chicago’s Rockefeller Chapel. The service will be followed by a wake at the nearby Quadrangle Club  1155 E 57th Street. In lieu of flowers  donations should be sent to Doctors Without Borders:http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org
                    Tonya Gunn  longtime UChicago employee  1970-2014            ,Tonya Gunn was known for managing three grills at a time at large family parties  cooking up steaks and her signature Southern-style smothered potatoes. She loved making sure that everyone left satisfied.Her co-workers said Gunn carried that same generous spirit each day to her job at the University of Chicago  where she worked for 21 years  the last 13 as a customer service representative with Facilities Services.“Tonya loved what she did; she loved helping people ” said Meachie Holman  Gunn’s supervisor and friend. “She always had a joke or a kind word  always had a smile on her face.”Gunn  44  was shot and killed early Monday  July 7  in the Morgan Park neighborhood where she grew up  during a get-together where she was cooking for relatives. A memorial service in her honor will be held at 11:30 a.m. Thursday  July 17 at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel  5850 S. Woodlawn Ave.“We are all grief-stricken ” Steven Wiesenthal  senior associate vice president for facilities and University architect  wrote in an email to employees last week. “Tonya has been an important  respected and beloved member of the University of Chicago community. Her work ethic and good-humored manner were appreciated by clients and co-workers alike  and her contributions supported the University of Chicago campus community.”Gunn attended Morgan Park High School and studied at Robert Morris University before joining the University of Chicago in 1993. Her work ethic began early: Her mother  Sandra Gunn  recalled that at age 10  Tonya secured a job as a cashier in her neighborhood grocery store and saved enough money to buy herself a new bike.“She was very reliable  very dependable ” Sandra Gunn said. “She went to work every day  and always aimed to please.”Tonya Gunn also was a lifelong musician who played drums  piano and guitar. “She was an all-around musician ” her mother said  noting that Tonya picked up the guitar at 2 years old and learned from her father how to play. “She loved all genres of music.”Gunn was devoted to her 11-year-old daughter  Destiny Fields  an honors student and gifted basketball player. “Her mother always told her  ‘You can do anything you put your mind to ’” Holman said.Gunn’s presence will be greatly missed in the Facilities Services office she has occupied for more than 13 years. “We all were like sisters ” Holman said. “We never argued. It was good spirit all of the time.”Gunn is survived by her mother; her daughter; her brother  Loren Crump; and a large extended family.In addition to the UChicago memorial service  a public viewing will be held on Tuesday  July 15  from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Angelus Memorial Chapel  8243 S.

                    Kathleen Paige Bohanon  fourth-year in College  1992–2014            ,Kathleen Paige Bohanon  fourth-year in the College  was guided by a passion for science  an infectious kindness  and an endless curiosity about the people and the world around her. She died on May 8 in Bakersfield  Calif. She was 21.Bohanon was born in Evanston  Ill.  and spent her early years in Germany and Belgium before her family moved to the San Diego area. She was an active and accomplished violinist  swimmer  Girl Scout and student. Her mother Nellie King remembers many science fair projects over the years  including experiments on whether skim or whole milk spoiled faster  the effects of hibernation on her pet gecko and how rats memorized mazes.“Kathleen had the rare quality of following what made her happy and exploring her passions ” said former roommate and friend Isabella Penido  a fourth-year in the College.She attended high school at The Bishop’s School in La Jolla  Calif.  and started college in 2009  drawn to the University of Chicago for the opportunity to do research as an undergraduate. She began as a resident of Halperin House  where she made close friends before moving off campus her second year.She joined the Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority  where her sisters found her unapologetically brainy. Penido recalls watching her friend translate a paper from German into English solely for the pleasure of reading it. “She was interested in everything ” Penido said.“Kathleen was one of our best  a student with extraordinary talent and potential as a research scientist ” said Stephen Kron  professor of molecular genetics and cell biology  who runs the Beckman Scholars Program. Bohanon was selected to be a part of the prestigious Beckman Scholars Program in 2013  which provides undergraduates a paid opportunity to study in the laboratory of a mentor for two summers.Through the program  she researched mammalian DNA modifications in the lab of Chuan He  professor of chemistry  and conducted neuroscience research in the lab of Paul Vezina  professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience. “Kathleen was a very good student. She did some nice work on developing sequencing methods for mammalian DNA modifications in my lab ” He said  adding that she was a friendly and welcome presence among the people in the lab.During a period in which she considered a career in medicine  Bohanon trained as a paramedic EMT and worked in Peru with an organization providing women with prenatal health care. “Kathleen was one of the most genuinely caring people I have ever met ” said Courtney Feller  AB’14  friend and fellow volunteer on the medical service trip to Peru.She soon returned to her passion for research  and settled on pursuing a degree in chemistry  biological chemistry and biological sciences. With her sharp intellect and genuine interest in other people’s success  she often found herself helping other students with difficult concepts.Kathleen is survived by her parents  Nellie King and Tom Bohanon. In honor of her interest in the science of the brain and mental illness  her family has asked that donations be directed to theBrain and Behavior Research Foundation.
                    Herbert Friedmann  biochemistry scholar and mentor  1927-2014            ,Herbert C. Friedmann  PhD’58  an authority on bacterial enzymes  the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 and the history of biology  and a role model for rigorous and effective teaching  died Monday  Jan. 13 at the University of Chicago Medicine from injuries sustained in a fall. He was 86 years old.Friedmann  an associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology  taught biochemistry to college and graduate students at UChicago for almost 50 years. He maintained an active research lab for the first half of that career then gradually shifted his energies from laboratory research to teaching and writing on the history of biology.His better-known later publications include a book on the history of enzymology  a 65-page treatise on the career of Theodore Escherich  for whom the ubiquitous bacteriumE. coli  was named  and a short paper listing his “Fifty-six laws of good teaching ” a quick reference containing sound advice for any instructor.“He was a witty and inspiring teacher with a sense of history ” said Jose Quintans  professor of pathology at the University of Chicago and former dean and master of the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division. “His signature course  Biochemistry 200  formed the core of the premed and bio-major curriculum. Top students considered it rewarding; it propelled them through medical school. Those less committed found the class challenging  but never questioned Friedmann’s engaging methods of presentation or his fairness in grading.”“All undergraduates wishing to go to medical school had to take Friedmann’s Introduction to Biochemistry course ” said Martin Horvath  PhD’94  a teaching assistant for the class and now an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah. “For each topic he would interject at least one analogy or story  drawing on a vast set of rich personal experiences. He could be quite irreverent. He literally would hop up and down many times during these classes. The students loved him. I now teach biochemistry and try  with varying degrees of success  to evoke the enthusiasm and passion that he brought to his teaching.”Herbert Claus Friedmann was born June 19  1927  in Mannheim  Germany  “nine years after the end of World War I ” he noted in a memoir  “and 12 years before the beginning of World War II.”His mother  a musician  played the violin. His father  a physician  had hoped to become an ophthalmologist  but he had been drafted into the German army in 1914 and assigned to care for soldiers suffering from syphilis  a disease with prominent skin manifestations. So he became a dermatologist.Family life changed radically for the Friedmanns when Herbert was 11 years old. On Nov. 10  1938  the second day of Kristallnacht  representatives of the Nazi party arrested his father for being Jewish and took him to Dachau  the first of the German concentration camps. That same day  a group of men entered and smashed nearly everything in the family’s Mannheim apartment  including the violin and medical instruments.At the time  Jews were permitted to emigrate overseas if they “voluntarily” gave up their property. A German professor  working in Bombay (now Mumbai)  arranged for the family to move to India and helped Friedmann secure work caring for patients with skin diseases  including syphilis and leprosy. He was released from Dachau after ten days  thanks to his wife  who travelled to Dachau with proof of a visa to India. He left for India immediately. The family followed in early 1939.They settled in Madras (now Chennai)  in southern India. In 1940  after World War II began  the family was “interned ” because they were German citizens in British India. They were moved to Yercaud  a “hill station” southwest of Madras  but were allowed to live there with few restrictions.Friedmann grew up and learned English and French in India. He completed high school in Yercaud in 1943 and earned his bachelor’s in chemistry at the University of Madras in 1947. After graduation  he worked in biochemistry labs at the University  studying enzymes  while completing his master of science degree.In 1954  the Mumbai colleague who had enabled the family to move to India pulled more strings and arranged for Friedmann to enter a PhD program  with a scholarship  at the University of Chicago. Friedmann worked with professor Brigit Vennesland  SB’34  PhD’38. He completed his PhD in 1958  worked as a research associate at the University for one year  followed by a two-year fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. There he met Joan Bowerman  his future wife  a Hopkins student with a master’s degree in German. They married in 1961.Friedmann returned to Chicago as a research associate (assistant professor) in physiology in 1960 and began his studies of vitamin B12 and its role in bacterial nucleotide synthesis. In 1964 he was named an assistant professor of biochemistry. He was later promoted to associate professor.He was consistently “one of the department’s best citizens ” said Donald Steiner  MS’56  MD’56  a former chair of biochemistry and molecular biology. “He gave more lectures than anyone else. He introduced undergraduates to biochemistry in a way that made it special.” He also initiated and ran the faculty seminar series.In 1978  Friedmann was one of two UChicago faculty members awarded the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. Based on letters of nomination from students  the award is among the most treasured by faculty.“He was unerringly kind and patient to his students  constantly reminding us of the heritage of the experimental sciences that we were studying  in which he had been a participant ” said Harvey Luksenburg  AB’73  MD’77. “For many of us  he was a lifelong friend  araconteur an authority on classical music  history and literature  and a gently ironic commentator on politics and academia.”Student assessments of Friedmann remained favorable for his entire career. He retired in 2009  at the age of 82  but his last batch of reviews was glowing. “Professor Friedmann is approachable and friendly and the single-best science professor I have had as an undergraduate ” one student wrote. Another added: “Not only does the University of Chicago need more men like Professor Friedmann  but so does biology.” Such reviews are consistent with Friedmann’s 56 laws of good teaching: especially numbers 8  “Never give a lecture unless your knowledge far exceeds the content of the lecture ” and 34  “Always take your students as seriously as they take you.”He is survived by his wife  Joan; their daughter  Elisabeth Pryor  and her husband Patrick; and two grandchildren  Eric  U High’13  and Amalia  MSW’11. A memorial service on campus is being planned.
                    Janet Rowley  cancer genetics pioneer  1925-2013            ,A pioneer in connecting the development of cancer with genetic abnormalities  Janet D. Rowley  the Blum-Riese Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine  Molecular Genetics & Cell Biology and Human Genetics at the University of Chicago  died from complications of ovarian cancer on Dec. 17 at her home. She was 88.Before Rowley  few scientists suspected that chromosomal aberrations caused cancer. Beginning in the 1970s  however  she made a series of fundamental discoveries demonstrating that specific chromosomal changes caused certain types of leukemia.Rowley’s discoveries changed the way cancer was understood  opened the door to development of drugs directed at the cancer-specific genetic abnormalities and created a model that still drives cancer research.“Janet Rowley’s work established that cancer is a genetic disease ” said Mary-Claire King  professor of genetics and medicine (medical genetics) at the University of Washington and president of the American Society of Human Genetics. “She demonstrated that mutations in critical genes lead to specific forms of leukemia and lymphoma  and that one can determine the form of cancer present in a patient directly from the genetic changes in the cancer. We are still working from her paradigm.”Nevertheless  she struggled for years to convince fellow researchers. “I became a kind of missionary ” she would often recall  preaching that chromosome abnormalities were important and hematologists should pay attention to them. “I got sort of amused tolerance at the beginning.”
                    Jean Bethke Elshtain  scholar of religion and political philosophy  1941-2013            ,Update:A memorial service for Prof. Jean Bethke Elshtain will be held at 4:30 p.m. Oct. 17 in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. The service  which will feature tributes from her colleagues at the Divinity School and elsewhere  will be followed by a reception in the third-floor lecture hall in Swift Hall.The service coincides with the final "Engaged Mind" conference  a four-year series that explores the themes of Elshtain's scholarship. The conference takes place Oct. 17-18 at the Divinity School. For more information and a full schedule of events  please visithttp://divinity.uchicago.edu/engaged-mind-just-war-against-terror.Jean Bethke Elshtain  one of the nation’s most prominent and provocative thinkers on religion  political philosophy  and ethics  died Sunday following a major cardiac incident earlier this summer. She was 72.Elshtain was the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics in the Divinity School  Political Science  and the Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago.An agile and extraordinarily prolific scholar  Elshtain’s work touched on issues ranging from terrorism to bioethics to feminism. She also lectured across the world on these topics in an effort to bring the work of the academy to a wider public.“Jean Bethke Elshtain was a formidable intellectual presence in the academy and in American public life ” said Margaret M. Mitchell  the Shailer M. Mathews Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature and dean of the Divinity School. “Her arrival at the Divinity School in 1995 came on the heels of the publication ofDemocracy on Trial  which was and remains a major statement of the crucial dimension of morality in American public discourse. We in the Divinity School and the University will miss Jean greatly.”Elshtain’s work was characterized by a combination of “hard-nosed realism and a very humane heart ” said her close friend and colleague William Schweiker  the Edward L. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics in the Divinity School.“She was suspicious of regimes of power  and she was always concerned with political and social systems that wanted to remake human life without respect for our finitude ” Schweiker said. “She was very attuned to the needs and goods of everyday life  and through her work she always fought on behalf of these mundane  quotidian interests.”Schweiker said many of these themes came together in Elshtain’s work on sovereignty  which was the topic of her 2005-2006Gifford Lectures  “Sovereign God  Sovereign State  Sovereign Self.”Elshtain was the author of many other influential works  includingWomen and War  an exploration of the traditional status of women as noncombatants;Augustine and the Limits of Politics  which applies Augustinian thought to contemporary politics and society; andJust War Against Terror which made a vigorous and widely discussed moral argument for greater American military engagement abroad.She is also the author ofPublic Man  Private Woman: Women in Social and Political Thought; Meditations on Modern Political Thought;Democracy on Trial;Real Politics: At the Center of Everyday Life;Who are We? Critical Reflections  Hopeful Possibilities; andJane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy.Although Elshtain’s colleagues did not always share her views  she remained a trusted interlocutor whose challenging questions always helped to strengthen their work  according to Prof. Martin Marty.“She loved to provoke and  through provocations  to stimulate conversation  argument and opportunities to learn ” said Marty  the Fairfax M. Cone Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Divinity School. “No doubt many commentators on her work will spend their energies discussing her from what are called ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal’ stances. But to reduce her to categories of partisanship or ideology  would be to miss the scholar.“I recall therealJean: friendly  buoyant  tireless  inquisitive  and faithful (and faith-full) in respect to family  the republic  and the vocation of teaching and learning.”Elshtain was born in Windsor  Colo.  on Jan. 6  1941. As a teenager  she was stricken with polio  but never let her physical challenges stop her. “She was truly ‘abled’ as she made the rounds of conferences  lectureships and any setting  including a coffee shop  where original ideas were honored ” Marty said.Despite her ambitious lecture schedule and commitment to her research  Elshtain never neglected her students or her teaching duties  according to Prof. Stephen Meredith  who co-taught several courses with Elshtain and remembered her “broad and imaginative” approach to her work.“She was a brilliant teacher who seemed to know everything about everything ” said Meredith  Professor in Pathology  Biochemistry  Molecular Biology and the College  and associate faculty in the Divinity School. “She cannot be replaced.”Elshtain was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  a Guggenheim Fellow and fellow at the Bellagio Center of the Rockefeller Foundation; holder of the Maguire Chair in Ethics at the Library of Congress; and a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  N.J.  where she also served on the board of trustees. She was a Phi Beta Kappa Lecturer  and in 2002  she received the Goodnow Award  the highest award bestowed by the American Political Science Association for distinguished service to the profession. She served on the boards of the National Humanities Center and the National Endowment for Democracy  and was a member of the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Scholars Council of the Library of Congress.Elshtain is survived by her husband Errol; her four children  Sheri  Heidi  Jenny and Eric; and her grandchildren  JoAnn Paulette Welch  Robert Paul Bethke  Christopher Matthew Welch and Christiane Lind Elshtain.Elshtain’s work was the subject of a four-part conference series at the Divinity School  “The Engaged Mind ” which began in 2010. The final conference will take place Oct. 17-18 and will provide an opportunity for the UChicago community to come together in celebration of Elshtain’s life and work.
                    Victor Barcilon  applied mathematician and geophysical scientist  1939–2020            ,Prof. Emeritus Victor Barcilon  applied mathematician and geophysical scientist  died April 15  2020. He was 81.A longtime professor at the University of Chicago  Barcilon showed a gift for using a type of mathematics called asymptotic analysis to improve understanding of the physical principles behind the world  from the mechanics of neurons to the behavior of oceans  glaciers and rock over time.“The basic laws of physics in their general primitive form are too hard to understand and solve in most natural phenomena ” wrote Prof. Douglas MacAyeal  a glaciologist in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences. “But with the gift of Victor’s deep  disciplined mathematical thinking  small physical understandings yield huge leaps and bounds of understanding (and forecast ability).”In the early part of his career  Barcilon published extensively in the field of fluid mechanics  and applied those principles to questions such as how lava forms new sea floor crusts when volcanoes erupt underwater—as well as other areas in meteorology and oceanography.He mentored MacAyeal  helping to determine how the ice streams of Antarctica flow and what happens below the ice of Antarctica where the ice/rock contact goes from frozen to melted.“The work that Victor mentored me on  and which we published as co-authors  forms the present basis of the understanding of Antarctica’s contribution to possible sea level rise  as far as ice-sheet models are concerned ” said MacAyeal.Later  Barcilon also applied mathematical and fluid modeling to understand the electrical movements inside cells  such as neurons. He also made contributions in pure and applied mathematics  considering problems such as the dynamics of vibrating strings.Barcilon was born in Cairo  Egypt in 1939. He attained a bachelor’s degree from McGill University in Montreal  Canada  and a master’s and doctorate in applied mathematics from Harvard University.Prior to joining the University of Chicago as an associate professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences  Barcilon was a faculty member in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Meteorology  and at the University of California  Los Angeles in the Department of Mathematics and Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. He also spent a year as postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oslo.Barcilon retired from UChicago in 2000. He and his wife Danielle Barcilon  a computer consultant  were avid art collectors who donated multiple pieces to museums. From 1978 to 1987  they also lived in and restored the Heller House  designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and located at 5132 S. Woodlawn Ave. in Hyde Park. Their daughter  Audrey  graduated from the UChicago Laboratory Schools in 1980.“Victor’s help and collegiality towards me was essential in my professional life ” said MacAyeal. “His way of thinking with discipline  guided by mathematics  was his genius and his contribution to both science and humanity.”—This story was first published by thePhysical Sciences Division.
                    Joel Schwab  doctor and mentor  1945-2013            ,Joel Schwab  professor of pediatrics and mentor to many residents and students  died at his home  surrounded by his family  on Friday  June 21  after a long battle with metastatic gastric cancer. He was 67 years old.Schwab was a role model for thousands of medical students and pediatric residents at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine and at Comer Children’s Hospital. Many students made the choice to devote their lives and careers to taking care of children based in large part on his example.[view:story=block_1]“The secret of his success was no secret ” said David Gozal  chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Chicago. “He cared for children as if they were his own. As a result  he was automatically adopted by his patients’ families. So the kids were happy  and the family was happy.”Schwab served on the Pritzker School of Medicine’s curriculum and admissions committees and on the Department of Pediatrics’ promotions  awards and education committees. He directed the pediatric clerkship  rounded daily with students and residents when he was on service  delivered 30 or more lectures a year  helped teach the clinical skills class for second-year students and led small-group sessions for third-year students.For residents  he often led morning report  the noon resident conference and the monthly pediatric attending case conference. He was a fixture in the outpatient clinic  and he was one of the first people that students and colleagues would turn to for advice when faced with a difficult diagnosis.“When their children got sick  the faculty  especially the other pediatricians  brought them in to see him ” said Daniel Johnson  chief of academic pediatrics at the University of Chicago. “Joel Schwab was the pediatrician’s pediatrician.”Born on July 27  1945  Schwab grew up in Brooklyn  N.Y. Neither of his parents completed high school  but his uncle was a general practitioner who encouraged his interest in medicine. His father  who ran a pool hall  taught him that there are many ways to do things incorrectly but only one way to do them right. “I truly believe this and have tried to follow this advice throughout my career ” Schwab said in talk he gave when he received the Gold Humanism Award in 2011.In 1967  Schwab earned his BA in zoology from the University of Michigan  where he met his wife  Gail Stein. He received his MD from New York Medical College in 1971. He completed his pediatric residency at Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago and was an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University until 1986  when he came to the University of Chicago. He initially maintained a hospital-affiliated private pediatric practice at the Child Life Center  based in Flossmoor  but since 1996 had focused his attention on pediatric care and teaching at the medical center.“I am proud to say I hired him into that position  and he was righter than right for it ” said Herbert Abelson  the former chairman of the Department of Pediatrics. “He was fantastic. He was genuinely interested in the students  and they were instantly won over by his combination of clinical expertise  devotion to his patients  communication skills and kindness. They honored him for his teaching repeatedly.”Schwab’s mentoring talents brought him many awards. He was selected by the medical students for inclusion in their class composite photograph for 16 consecutive years  a coveted internal honor. In 1998  he received the Faculty Teaching Award and was voted Teacher of the Year by the pediatric residents. He received the Pritzker School of Medicine Outstanding Clinical Teaching Award and the Leonard Tow Humanism in Medicine Award in 2006.“He also helped us pick the best students and residents for 15 years ” Johnson said. “He was crucial to picking the right people and then making them into excellent doctors  not just brilliant technicians but also caring  sensitive  communicative healers—someone you knew instantly you could trust.”The Class of 2013 chose him as the speaker for their graduation ceremony. At that event  his last public lecture  Schwab described how the profession had changed since he first became a doctor and warned the graduating medical students to beware “the process of professional socialization.” He worried that their original commitment might wither away or turn into “something barely recognizable.”“Do not let this happen ” he told them. “You do need to worry about costs  and you do need to read the latest journals  but do not forget that medicine is also an endeavor of the heart. At the same time you are learning about disease and diagnosis and treatment  you are also learning about illness  the patient and yourself.”In that same talk  he passed on suggestions about how to make the practice of medicine more satisfying for them and more rewarding for their patients. “Become an excellent role model ” he suggested. “Understand the influence your behavior will have. … Be polite. And never forget: The patient comes first and is always the most important person in the equation.”Schwab is survived by his brother  Jay; his wife  Gail; their daughters  Laura and Lynn  and son  David; and five grandchildren.Services were held on June 24. The family has requested that donations be made to the Joel Schwab Fund at the University of Chicago.
                    Joseph Ceithaml  former Pritzker dean of students  1916-2013            ,Joseph J. Ceithaml  dean of students emeritus for the Pritzker School of Medicine and the Biological Sciences Division and professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Chicago  died on Saturday  May 11. He was 96.Ceithaml served as dean of students in medicine and the biological sciences from 1951 to 1986  shepherding the academic careers of 2 914 future physicians and 1 460 research biologists. He was a central figure in shaping the character of medical and biological education at UChicago  building the medical school’s national reputation and attracting many of the nation’s best and most well-rounded students to the program.He also was influential at the national level in efforts to expand the pool of applicants for medical schools. He fought the idea that the standard biology-based “pre-med” curriculum was a prerequisite and sought students with diverse interests  origins and socio-economic backgrounds. When he became dean of students  half of all medical students came from families with incomes in the top fifth of the population. Changing that meant funding need-based scholarships.“Dean Ceithaml made it possible for thousands of students to develop into outstanding doctors and scientists  and he was firmly committed to ensuring that students received financial aid  thus allowing more flexibility in their career decisions ” said Holly Humphrey  current dean for medical education at the University of Chicago. “He was a kind and generous man who placed student well-being at the top of his priority list.”Ceithaml was a tireless advocate for students  helping them progress through their medical education without amassing huge debts. He grew the medical school’s no-interest loan fund program from $25 000 in 1951 to more than $6 million in 1986. The Ceithaml Scholarship  named in his honor  funds the medical education of many students each year and continues to expand.“Dr. Ceithaml was one of the most revered student deans in the country ” said Norma Wagoner  who became dean of students soon after Ceithaml stepped down. “He served as a mentor to many  and was the most important mentor in my own life. He was one of a kind.”During his 35 years as dean  Ceithaml developed the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University  obtaining federal funding in 1967 for what would become one of the leading programs in the country. He implemented the medical school’s pass/fail system. He also helped develop the centralized American Medical College Application Service through the Association of American Medical Colleges.“He was the kind of person you would want to have with you in tough times ” said his friend  cardiologist Louis Cohen  professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Chicago and a former member of the admissions committee. “He was dependable  loyal  reliable and incorruptible. No one ever bought their way into this medical school.”Ceithaml’s family can vouch for that. When his son  Eric  now chief of pediatric cardiovascular surgery at the University of Florida at Jacksonville  was looking at medical schools  his father told him: “Don’t even apply here. You won’t get in. Your grades are not good enough.”“He did put in a good word for me at another medical school ” Eric said. “He was strict and he had high expectations  but he was always supportive  always there for us. If you had a problem or a challenge  he would help you sort it out. That’s why so many med students loved him unconditionally.”His daughter  Lenore  who practices immigration law in San Diego  said UChicago and the medical students were like a second family to him. “He kept in touch with them after graduation and remembered all their names and details about their lives ” she said. “He left quite the legacy.”Colleague Frank Fitch  professor emeritus of pathology and a former member of the admissions committee  lauded Ceithaml for his ability to discern the quality of a student applicant.“Joe had a fantastic talent for recruiting the really good students  a knack for spotting those with tremendous potential even if they had some questionable credentials  and the talent and inclination  almost paternal  to help those who got into difficulties ” Fitch said. “There are not many people around like him.”Born May 23  1916  into a family of Czechoslovakian immigrants on the Southwest Side of Chicago  Joseph James Ceithaml graduated from Lindblom High School as valedictorian of his class. He was the first of his parents’ six children to go to college. He entered the University of Chicago in 1933  where he discovered a passion for biochemistry. After graduating in 1937  he entered the biochemistry doctoral program and completed his PhD in 1941  just weeks before Pearl Harbor was bombed. In May 1942  he married Ann Bednarik  a high school friend.During World War II  Ceithaml worked on a malaria-research project based at the University of Chicago and run by the Office of Scientific Research and Development of the U.S. War Manpower Commission. In 1946  he was named an assistant professor of biochemistry at the University of Chicago. He also worked part time as a pre-med adviser. In 1948  he and his wife left Chicago for a post-doctoral fellowship at California Institute of Technology  where he worked with geneticist George Beadle—who would win the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1958 and become president of the University of Chicago in 1961.In 1949  after completing his fellowship  Ceithaml returned to the University of Chicago. In 1950  he won the University’s Quantrell Award  the highest honor bestowed upon undergraduate teachers. In 1951  he was named dean of students for medicine and biological sciences. He was promoted to professor in 1958. He retired in 1986 at age 70.As dean of students  Ceithaml was revered for his in-depth knowledge about every student and for his efforts to help students with academic  financial or personal problems. He tackled similar issues at the national level  serving as chairman of the Association of American Medical Colleges’ committee on medical student financing  from 1961 to 1964  and as vice chairman and chairman of the Group on Student Affairs  1965 to 1969. He also served on the board of directors of the National Resident Matching Program from 1967 to 1980  during the period when the computerized Match system was implemented.“Joe and two other student deans founded the Group on Student Affairs at the AAMC ” Wagoner said. “When he spoke  everyone listened  and very few ever refuted anything he had to say. His brilliant  practical  down-to-earth solutions always seemed to be on target. As a result  many of the policies that govern the Group on Student Affairs today initially came from him.”Among those students who Ceithaml impacted: Ted Steck  professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular biology.“He was totally committed to the students  the University and his job ” recalled Steck  who was interviewed by Ceithaml when he applied to the medical school and later became Ceithaml’s department chairman. “I should add that he always had the same hair style—a crew cut  flat on top—for all the decades I knew him.”Ceithaml received several career honors but was particularly proud of the 1982 Gold Key Award  which recognizes outstanding and loyal service to the Biological Sciences Division and to the University of Chicago  and for having the medical student and alumni center named for him  just before he retired.“His hobbies kept him fit long after he retired ” said Ernest Mhoon  professor of surgery at the University of Chicago. “He played squash  he loved fishing and he enjoyed hiking through the woods looking for mushrooms  which he often shared with my wife and me. We would not ordinarily eat wild mushrooms  but this was Joe Ceithaml. We trusted him.”Ann  his wife of 43 years  died of cancer in 1985. Ceithaml is survived by his second wife  Mildred  whom he married in 1989  and her son Bob Husa; two children  Lenore and Eric; Eric’s wife Susan; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Services were private. A memorial service at UChicago is being planned. In lieu of flowers  donations should be made to thePritzker School of Medicine: Joseph J. Ceithaml Scholarship Fund  designed to lessen the large debt burden medical students often face upon graduation.
                    William B. Johnson  Trustee Emeritus  1918-2013            ,William B. Johnson  University Trustee Emeritus and former chairman and chief executive officer of IC Industries  died April 24 in Lake Forest  Ill.  following a stroke at the age of 94.Johnson joined the University Board of Trustees in 1974  became a Life Trustee in 1983 and Emeritus Trustee in 2007. He served on the executive committee for eight years and on the investment committee for more than 15 years.Johnson came to Chicago in 1966  after he was elected president  CEO  and a director of the Illinois Railroad and its parent company  IC Industries. He served as chairman of the executive committee of Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Company from 1972 to 1976 after the merger of Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Company and the Gulf  Mobile & Ohio railroads.He was elected chairman and CEO of IC Industries in 1972. In these capacities he directed the acquisition of more than 100 companies  growing IC Industries to a Fortune 100 company during the 1970s and 1980s.Crain’s Chicago Businessnamed him Executive of the Year in 1985. Johnson became chairman emeritus of IC Industries  now known as Whitman Corporation  in 1987. He continued his affiliation with Illinois Central Railroad  serving as a director and audit committee chairman until June 1999  when the merger with Canadian National was completed.Johnson was born Dec. 28  1928  in Salisbury  Md. He received his bachelor’s degree  maxima cum laude  in 1940 from Washington College in Maryland  where he served as president of the Student Government Association and was a member of the tennis team.

                    Roger Ebert  X’70  film critic and longtime Graham School lecturer  1942-2013            ,Before Roger Ebert  X’70  became one of the world’s most influential film critics  he began doctoral studies in English at the University of Chicago in 1966. Although Ebert left his studies to pursue a remarkable career as a Pulitzer-winning journalist and commentator  he never fully left the University  serving for 37 years as a lecturer on film for the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.Ebert died of cancer on April 4 at age 70  prompting tributes and remembrances from around the world.A lasting affection developed over the years between Ebert and the UChicago community. He began his service as a lecturer in 1968  shortly after becoming a film critic with theChicago Sun-Times. Colleagues and students said he passionately introduced his classes to global cinematic styles  genres and directorial oeuvres. Starting in 1994  Ebert typically taught classes at the University’s Gleacher Center in downtown Chicago.“In many ways  he was a public intellectual ” said Judy Hoffman  senior lecturer in Cinema and Media Studies and the Department of Visual Arts  who first met Ebert when she was a young filmmaker. “In his reviews  he led you through a continuum of film history. He really taught—it wasn’t just giving films a thumbs up or a thumbs down. He knew film history  and wrote his reviews with that in mind.”A native of Urbana  Ill.  and a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  Ebert also maintained a lifelong connection there  including launching Roger Ebert’s International Film Festival in Champaign. Ebert gained widespread recognition through his work on television with fellow critic Gene Siskel  with shows includingSneak PreviewsandSiskel & Ebert At the Movies. His writing on film as well as cultural and political topics was broadly influential; in 1975  Ebert became the first person to receive a Pulitzer Prize for film criticism.At UChicago  Ebert was particularly committed to discussions and conversations with students  encouraging them to develop their ideas and challenge his conclusions. He was known to test his critiques with students and respect the feedback he received. Often  class sessions were significantly extended beyond scheduled times in order to adequately treat topics and provide ample time for discussions with students.A passion for independent filmIn addition to his teaching  Ebert was a longtime admirer of the student-run Doc Films society  founded in 1932  a UChicago showcase for diverse and often rare films. In a2008 post on his blog  Ebert praised Doc’s commitment to screening legendary directors’ films  which are often unavailable on DVD. “It says something about DVD producers  but even more about Doc Films.” Ebert also returned to campus for Doc Films events  including adiscussion in 2000at the Max Palevsky Cinema with filmmaker Woody Allen.Ebert discussed the memories that the University of Chicago’s architecture evokes for him in a2010 blog postfeaturing the campus photography of Justin Kern  AB’04  PhD’10. “I spent a year as a doctoral student at the University of Chicago  and [Kern’s] photographs made my heart quicken ” Ebert wrote.Remarkably  during Ebert’s tenure with the Graham School he never repeated a course—evidence of the breadth and depth of his knowledge and his devotion to continual learning. He was particularly interested in studying oeuvres of important film figures  including Ingmar Bergmann  Federico Fellini  Francois Truffaut  Luis Bunuel  Alfred Hitchcock  Werner Herzog  Orson Welles  Billy Wilder and John Huston.On multiple occasions  Ebert also arranged to bring these figures to the classroom to discuss their works with students. A representative class he taught in 2003 was titled “Not the New Wave: Before and After the Revolution.”The University of Chicago Magazinereported in 2004that Ebert’s class had “achieved cult status  with students returning year after year.”The range of Ebert’s interests set him apart from other critics  according to Hoffman  a member of the board of directors at Kartemquin Films  which producedHoop Dreamsand numerous acclaimed documentaries. Ebert sought out and supported independent films that weren’t on the radar of other critics. “If it wasn’t for Roger championingHoop Dreams  that film never would have gotten the national attention it did ” Hoffman said.“Clearly  film was everything to him ” Hoffman added. “He wanted other people to share that love of cinema.”“The Graham School and its students were fortunate to have Roger Ebert as a prized and highly respected instructor for 37 years ” said Graham School Dean Daniel Shannon. “He represented the highest values of the University and the Graham School  as someone with an extraordinary commitment to his area of expertise and a passion for sharing his knowledge with others.”
                    Donald Rowley  pioneering immunologist  1923-2013            ,Update:A memorial service for Donald Rowley is being planned for 2:30 p.m. on April 21 at Bond Chapel  1025 E. 58th St.Donald Rowley  a pioneer in discovering how the immune system functions and the inventor of the gel electrode  a crucial tool that monitors cardiac activity  died at his home Feb. 24  after a long battle with congestive heart failure. He was 90 years old.Rowley  professor emeritus in pathology and the Committee on Immunology  was a wide-ranging and imaginative researcher. He made a series of fundamental discoveries that had a significant impact on the basic understanding of the immune system as well as on many clinical specialties  including cancer immunology  organ transplantation and cardiovascular disease.[view:story=block_3=167579]“Don Rowley was someone who did productive original research in many fields ” said immunologist Hans Schreiber  professor of pathology at UChicago and a former student of Rowley’s. “He had the capacity to dig into many different areas  ask the important questions  design elegant experiments to answer them and then shift his attention to new problems. Don was always looking for the next important question. He was admired by people I admire.”His best-known discovery came outside his chosen field. In 1954  as an immunologist working in a pathology department  Rowley was “coerced ” as he put it in a memoir  “into spending two days a week for two years on the hospital’s autopsy service.”He and cardiac pathologist Seymour Glagov  were struck by a colleague’s observation during an autopsy that people who died from clogged coronary arteries often had pristine renal arteries. They wondered: Could something related to proximity to the beating heart be the cause? If so  they hypothesized  those with higher heart rates would have greater risk.At the time  there were no tools to monitor heartbeats over long periods; so they invented one. They worked with an undergraduate student at UChicago and a watch repairman to convert a spring-wound pocket watch into a portable pulse counter and built tiny electrical sensors that could be glued reliably to the chest—the first gel electrodes. The gadget later would be scaled up with help from the Elgin National Watch Co. and Illinois Bell Telephone.This simple device  no bigger than a deck of cards  accurately could record the electrical activity of the heart for more than 24 hours. It heralded the birth of ambulatory cardiology. Rowley and colleagues described their counter in a report toSciencein 1959. They performed additional studies on 100 volunteers  showing enormous variation in daily heart rates.Reaction from most clinicians “ranged from open hostility to amiable skepticism ” Rowley later would recall. By the late 1960s  several studies had confirmed the connections between continuously elevated pulse rates and heart attacks or sudden cardiac death. By then  the gel electrode had become ubiquitous.“We never considered patenting the principle of the electrodes ” Rowley later lamented. It was “simply not part of the academic culture.”In the late 1960s  Rowley and his graduate student Donald Mosier were the first to describe the function of a previously unrecognized cell type  a component of the adaptive immune system they labeled the “A cell ” for its “adherent  accessory or antigen-presenting capacity.” This was a rare blood cell that could recognize elements of foreign tissue and present these antigens to B and T lymphocytes  which play a major role in the body’s adaptive immune response.In 1973  a research team headed by Ralph Steinman at the Rockefeller University also described a new immune cell type  which they called the dendritic cell for its branching  tree-like shape. Over time  it became clear that A and dendritic cells were “one and the same ” according to a 2012 essay by Rowley and Frank Fitch  professor emeritus of pathology at the University of Chicago. Subsequent work by the Rockefeller group demonstrated the fundamental importance of dendritic cells in the initiation and regulation of the body’s response to foreign antigens—work that posthumously brought Steinman the 2011 Nobel Prize.“The Rockefeller team did marvelous work on this and convinced the scientific community ” said Schreiber  “but Rowley had the function before Steinman had the shape.”Rowley made additional advances in several areas. In the early 1950s  he demonstrated the critical role of the spleen in antibody production  showing that its removal virtually abolished production of circulating antibodies.In the 1960s  Rowley and Fitch developed a highly targeted way to suppress the immune system’s attack on transplanted organs. By exposing a rat to antigens from an organ-donor rat the day before a transplant  followed the next day with antibodies against those antigens  they could prevent rejection without weakening the rat’s defenses against pathogens. This seemingly promising approach never reached human trials.“They were terrific guys to work with ” said transplant surgeon Frank Stuart  who came to the University of Chicago in 1966. “Together  we devised more and more specific ways to tamper with each immunologic pathway. This work eventually let us focus treatment like carefully targeted rifle shots  rather than blasting the whole immune system with a blunderbuss.”From then on  much of Rowley’s research focused on immunology and cancer. He tested novel methods to focus the immune system on tumors and to prevent the cancer from weakening or deflecting an immune response.distinguished career at UChicagoDonald Adams Rowley was born Feb. 4  1923  in Owatonna  Minn.  about 50 miles south of Minneapolis. His father  Julian  a doctor of osteopathic medicine  taught him to sail and they built boats and rafts together. Rowley graduated from Pillsbury Military Academy as valedictorian in 1941 and won a full scholarship  worth $300 a year  to the University of Chicago.In 1943  Rowley enlisted in a U.S. Army program that trained physicians. This allowed him to combine the last two years of college with first years of medical school. He graduated from college in 1945  but was soon expelled from medical school for  in his words  “asking too many questions  arguing and other defects of character.”The Army sent him to the Philippines to work in a medical-aid station being set up in advance of an invasion on Japan. With the surrender of the Japanese that August  the aid station was used to provide care for Japanese prisoners.In 1946  Rowley returned to UChicago as a graduate student in pathology and worked in the laboratory of the department chairman on a project that led to two single-authored papers.He was allowed to return to medical school in January 1948  when he met fellow medical student Janet Davison at an ice skating rink; she needed help and he  a skilled hockey player  provided it. They married 11 months later on Dec. 18  1948—the day after she graduated from medical school. He received his master’s degree in pathology and his doctor of medicine degree in 1950.After an internship at the U.S. Public Health System’s Marine Hospital in Chicago  he served as an assistant surgeon for the Public Health System’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  where he studied the pathogenesis of histoplasmosis  a fungal infection. In 1954  he returned to the University of Chicago as a research associate (instructor) in pathology and was on the autopsy service  as well as doing research at what was then called La Rabida Sanitarium.Rowley was promoted to assistant professor in 1957  associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1969. He also was named a professor of pediatrics in 1973 and served as the director of the La Rabida Children’s Hospital and Research Center from 1978 to 1981  and as director of research at the La Rabida-University of Chicago Institute from 1973 to 1987.A prolific author  Rowley published more than 100 research papers  many in leading journals  as well as several book chapters. He helped his graduate students publish single-author papers  describing work done under his supervision in his laboratory  often in high-profile journals such asScienceor theJournal of Immunology. “This is a courtesy that no longer exists ” Schreiber said.That sort of generosity  giving his students complete credit  “was typical of Don ” Fitch said. “He was a wonderful  genuine friend and colleague and  for many students and young faculty  a mentor. He was a small-town boy who thrived in the big city.”Rowley received many honors. He received a U.S. Public Health System Merit Award. Both he and his wife were named American Association for the Advancement of Science fellows by their peers in 1998 in recognition of “meritorious efforts to advance science.” He served as president of the Chicago Association of Immunologists and as associate editor of theJournal of Immunology. He was a member of the immunobiology study section of the National Institutes of Health and of the Leukemia Research Foundation’s advisory board.He reveled in the accomplishments of his wife  who raised their sons while working part time as a physician and then met extraordinary success in cancer research  winning a steady stream of honors  including the Lasker Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.“I admired Don for that ” Fitch said. “He was proud but in no way jealous  and it did not affect how he approached his career.”He was also a good father  according to his son  David. “He was reasonably strict early in life ” he said  “but unbelievably supportive later on.”Rowley shared his deep interest in woodworking with his sons  organizing summer projects together  which usually involved boats. He filled the home with tables  chairs  shelves and bookcases he designed and built. He even patented his design for lightweight tables that could be fastened onto balcony railings.In 1993  Rowley moved to emeritus status  but he remained active in the laboratory into his late 80s  publishing several papers in 2012. He continued to do research until the end  meeting with a colleague the day before he died to discuss a project.Rowley is survived by his wife  Janet  a distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago; three of their four sons: David  Robert and Roger; five grandchildren: Jason  Jenny  Gia  Anra and Ian; and his sister  Alice Panzer.A memorial service is being planned for the spring. In lieu of flowers  contributions may be directed to theDonald and Janet Rowley Scholarship Fund  which aids undergraduates at the University of Chicago.
                    Alex Frizzell  fourth-year in the College  1991-2013            ,Alex Frizzell was driven to help others  calling upon what she learned as a student of environmental economics  an avid traveler and an aspiring physician. Frizzell  a fourth-year in the College who majored in economics  died Feb. 4 at the age of 21 in Hyde Park.At the University of Chicago  Frizzell’s academic interests included the Arabic and Urdu languages and classes on economics  environmental sustainability and agriculture  where she researched land use in the Western United States and renewable energy.“She was a very inquisitive student ” said Sabina Shaikh  an economics lecturer who taught Frizzell. “She always wanted to know more  to know how to take what she’s learning in class and apply it to her own personal interests.”Chief among those interests were ecological conservation efforts in her home state of Idaho. Although born in Birmingham  Ala.  Frizzell grew up in rural Idaho  rafting on the Salmon River and camping in the Sawtooth Mountain Range. Frizzell’s father  Tyler  said Alex also developed a keen interest in the economics of poverty while traveling with him to countries including Nepal  South Africa and Chile.At UChicago  Frizzell looked for ways to bridge those studies by exploring the economic incentives for businesses to be environmentally conscious. And as graduation approached  she began to consider a career in medicine  which her father  a neurological surgeon  said was a good fit.“We spent 12 years together traveling the world and going to schools  talking to people  working in hospitals  and she wanted to understand how everything worked ” he said. “She had a lot of interest in equality  in terms of trying to eradicate poverty using economic as well as medical approaches.”Friends and family members described Frizzell as thoughtful and insightful.“She was the type of friend that would offer to pick you up at the airport  or would spend all her energy ensuring that your birthday party was fun ” added Gabe Pugel  a fellow fourth-year who was close to Frizzell.Speaking at a memorial service for Frizzell in early February  fourth-year Alice Li said Frizzell often surprised her with the energy she devoted to helping friends in need.“One time I told her off-handedly that I was having bad dreams  and she came back from a trip that weekend and gave me a dream catcher she had picked up at the airport ” she said.Her mother  Barbara  said Frizzell’s individuality came through whenever she talked about her plans for the future  which included clinical work in a hospital in Peru and enrolling in classes needed to apply to medical school.“She was always planning ” Barbara Frizzell said. “She gave everything 110 percent.”Frizzell is survived by her parents  Tyler and Barbara Frizzell; and siblings  Anna  Erin  Jon and Will.
                    Richard M. Morrow  Trustee Emeritus  1926-2013            ,University of Chicago Trustee Emeritus and former chairman and chief executive officer of Amoco Corporation Richard M. Morrow  died on Jan. 21 at the age of 86.Morrow was born Feb. 27  1926  in Wheeling  W.Va. He attended John Carroll University in Cleveland. Following three and a half years in the U.S. Navy during World War II he received a B.S. in mining and petroleum engineering from Ohio State University.He began his career with the Amoco Production Company in 1948  when the domestic oil-producing subsidiary was known as Standard Oil Company (Indiana). Morrow became chief engineer of Amoco Production’s producing department in 1962. He became vice president and manager of the company’s Denver region in 1965. Morrow next served as executive vice president of Amoco International Oil Company  the Amoco subsidiary in charge of all overseas oil operations  from 1966 until 1970.Morrow moved to corporate headquarters in Chicago in 1970 as executive vice president of Amoco Chemicals Corp.  the Amoco subsidiary focused on the manufacture and sale of chemical products. He became its president in 1974. During this period FortuneMagazine reported in 1987  Morrow “won a reputation as a good listener and delegator who never made mistakes.”He became president of Amoco Corporation in 1978  and its chairman and chief executive officer in 1983. Under his leadership  the company  which changed its name to Amoco Corporation in 1985  successfully expanded overseas and restructured costs at a time when many U.S. oil companies were deeply troubled.Amoco and Morrow often made headlines during his CEO tenure. In 1985 John Swearingen  whom Morrow had succeeded as CEO  told theChicago Sun-Timesthat “Dick is the best kind of oil executive: intelligent  efficient  and very  very competent.”Morrow retired from Amoco in 1991. Amoco was then second in size only to Sears Roebuck among Chicago-based corporations  employing 53 000 employees worldwide and enjoying annual revenues of nearly $32 billion. Although he liked to hunt  fish  ski  golf and play gin rummy in his off hours  after retirement Morrow immediately became chairman of Leadership for Quality Education to help address a crisis in Chicago’s public schools. He continued to work out of his 79th floor office in what today is called the Aon Center  sometimes arriving as early as 7 a.m. to address a variety of civic matters  especially Chicago’s public education problems.“Something has to be done and done right now ” Morrow told theChicago Tribunein 1991. “If not  we won’t have a labor force to compete in the 21st century. And it’s not just Chicago. Everywhere you look  they are restructuring the schools.”Morrow joined the University Board in 1979. For more than 10 years  he served on the Executive  Investment  and Nominating committees. He was elected Life Trustee in 1992 and Trustee Emeritus in 2007.In 1985 he served on the ad hoc Committee on University/Industry Relations  whose recommendations led to the establishment of the ARCH Development Corporation  a not-for-profit affiliate of the University that formerly oversaw the development of commercial ventures based on research at the University and Argonne National Laboratory. He served on the board of ARCH from 1985 to 2000 (as chair from 1989 to 1991). In 1983-1984 Morrow served as Chair of the Corporate Gifts Committee for the Campaign for the Arts and Sciences. He was also a member of the Booth Council and Social Sciences Visiting Committee.In 1986 Morrow was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. In 1990 the Civic Federation awarded Morrow the Lyman J. Gage Founder’s Medallion for outstanding civic achievement. In 1991  Amoco Foundation contributed $1.5 million to Ohio State University to create a faculty chair in Morrow’s honor. He also received honorary degrees from American University in Cairo  Ohio State University  Northwestern University  DePaul University  Roosevelt University  and the Illinois Institute of Technology.Morrow was a director of First Chicago Corp.  First National Bank of Chicago  Westinghouse Electric Corporation  R.R. Donnelly and Sons Co.  and other corporations. He served on the board of the American Petroleum Institute and of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. He also had been a trustee of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Medical Center  chairman of the Civic Committee of Chicago  and an executive committee member of the Chicago Community Trust.Morrow is survived by a daughter and two granddaughters. In keeping with tradition  a memorial resolution in Morrow’s honor will be presented at the board’s March meeting.
                    Elwood Jensen  pioneer in cancer biology research  1920-2012            ,Elwood V. Jensen  known worldwide for his pioneering research on how steroid hormones exert their influence through specific receptors in target cells  died from pneumonia on Sunday  Dec. 16  in suburban Cincinnati. He was 92.Jensen was the Charles B. Huggins Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Ben May Department for Cancer Research and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Chicago.His discoveries led to the development of drugs that can enhance or inhibit the effects of hormones  earning him many honors  including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 and the Lasker Award in 2004 for outstanding contributions to basic and clinical medical research. They transformed the treatment of breast cancer patients in a way that  according to the Lasker Foundation  “saves or prolongs more than a 100 000 lives annually.”“Jensen’s revolutionary discovery of estrogen receptors is beyond doubt one of the major achievements in biochemical endocrinology of our time ” said Gene DeSombre  professor emeritus at UChicago  who worked with Jensen as a post-doctoral fellow and then as a colleague.[view:story=block_3=166482]“His work is hallmarked by great technical ingenuity and conceptual novelty ” DeSombre said. “His promulgation of simple yet profound ideas concerning the role of receptors in estrogen action has been of greatest importance for research on the basic and clinical physiology of not only estrogens  but also of all other categories of steroid hormones.”Before Jensen  DeSombre said  how hormones caused their effects was “a complete mystery.”In the 1950s  biochemists thought a hormone entered a cell  where it triggered a series of oxidation and reduction reactions. These provided energy for growth stimulation and other estrogen-specific actions.Working with estradiol  Jensen proved that hormones do not undergo chemical change to elicit a response—an accepted explanation at the time. Instead  he found that they bind to a receptor protein within the cell. This hormone-receptor complex then travels to the cell nucleus  where it regulates gene expression.“That really got him into some hot water ” DeSombre recalled.But his initial exposure was limited. When he first presented preliminary data at a 1958 meeting in Vienna  only five people attended. Three of them were the other speakers.From the late 1950s to the 1970s  Jensen published a series of major and highly original discoveries in four related areas that transformed hormone research:In 1958  he showed that only the tissues that respond to estrogens  such as those of the female reproductive tract  were able to concentrate injected estradiol from the blood. This uptake pattern suggested that these cells must contain specific binding proteins  which he called “estrogen receptors.” He subsequently identified the estrogen receptor in cells of the uterus—the first receptor found for any steroid hormone.In 1967  Jensen and Jack Gorski of the University of Illinois showed that these putative receptors were macromolecules that could be extracted from these tissues. When estrogens bound to this receptor in the nucleus  the receptor complex activated specific genes  stimulating new RNA synthesis.By 1968  Jensen had devised a reliable test for the presence of estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells. It had been known for decades that about one-third of premenopausal women who had advanced breast cancer would respond to estrogen blockade brought about by removing their ovaries  the source of estrogens  but there was no way to predict which women would respond. In 1971  Jensen showed that women with receptor-rich breast cancers often have remissions following removal of the sources of estrogens  but cancers that contain few or no estrogen receptors do not respond to estrogen-blocking therapy.In 1980  Jensen and Geoffrey Greene  also in the University of Chicago’s Ben May Institute  had developed monoclonal antibodies directed against the human estrogen receptor  which enabled them to quickly and accurately detect and count estrogen receptors in breast and other tumors. By the mid-1980s  this test had become a standard part of care for breast cancer patients.Following Jensen’s lead  researchers soon discovered that the receptors for the other major steroid hormones—such as progesterone  testosterone and cortisone—worked essentially the same way.By the early 1970s  Jensen was searching for medications  rather than surgical procedures  to shield estrogen-dependent tumors from circulating hormones. He and colleague V. Craig Jordan (then at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Massachusetts) found that most women with cancers that contain large amounts of estrogen receptor could benefit from treatment with tamoxifen  a compound that blocks some of the effects of estrogens. The Food and Drug Administration approved tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment in 1977 and for breast cancer prevention in 1990.“We were glad ” Jensen would later recall  “we could do something that helped patients with breast cancer  to know that our basic research findings could be extended to the clinical management of patients with this terrible disease.”Born Jan. 13  1920  in Fargo  N.D.  Elwood Vernon Jensen grew up in Springfield  Ohio. His mother  a schoolteacher  taught him to read at a young age  so when he entered school at the age of 4 he immediately jumped ahead two grade levels.“I was kind of tall  skinny and socially immature ” he said in an interview in 2009. “This was a handicap.”But he took up boxing as a student at Wittenberg College and found that being tall and thin was an advantage. He decisively won his first two matches  at a local golden gloves tournament with 3 000 people watching  including his future wife.“All the applause ” he recalled in an interview many years later with an Ohio newspaper. “That was the turning point in my life.”He graduated from Wittenberg in 1940 with a degree in chemistry  began a graduate chemistry program at the University of Chicago in the fall  and married Mary Collette in June 1941. Six months later  the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing war altered their plans. Poor eyesight kept him from becoming a pilot  so he joined a research project on chemical warfare at the University.Two hospitals stays  after his experiments “proceeded more vigorously than anticipated ” helped him focus his nascent career on combining chemistry with medicine.Despite the delay  he completed his PhD in 1944  spent a year working with his doctoral adviser on a synthetic rubber project  then obtained a Guggenheim Fellowship to study steroid chemistry at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.Jensen often declared that his most important lesson from a year in Europe was learned not in the lab but in the Alps. Despite having no experience  he accepted a friend’s invitation to climb the Matterhorn  the last major peak in Europe to be conquered.“It was the hardest physical challenge I would ever encounter ” he would later write  but the history of this fabled peak taught him “the lesson of the alternative approach.” The first team to reach the summit  in 1865  took a route up the northeast face that others had dismissed as impossible.In 1947  Jensen joined the University of Chicago as an assistant professor of surgery where he worked closely with Charles Huggins  who would win the Nobel Prize in 1966 for his work on hormones and prostate cancer. Huggins “taught me medicine ” Jensen wrote in a commentary forNature Medicinein 2004  “and I taught him some chemistry.”In 1951  Jensen became one of the original members of the Ben May Laboratory for Cancer Research  founded that year by Huggins. In 1957  working with colleagues at Fermilab  Jensen built an apparatus for labeling estradiol with tritium  a radioactive marker that let him track the hormone as it traveled through the blood stream to the tissues  such as the uterus  that contained its receptor. This was his alternative approach: to “determine not what the hormone does to the tissue  but what the tissue does with the hormone.”“I really admired him ” said former colleague Shutsung Liao  professor in the Ben May Department for Cancer Research and an authority on male hormones and cancer. “He was very careful  very serious in how he applied his knowledge of chemistry to biological problems. He opened a whole new field.”He was promoted to professor in 1960. He became director of the Ben May Laboratory in 1969 when Huggins stepped down. He served in that role until 1982. After his wife died in 1982  Jensen took an extended leave from UChicago to serve as medical director for the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Zurich from 1983-87.In Zurich  he met Hiltrud Herborg  known as Peggy  a popular cabaret singer. They married in December 1983. She later was diagnosed with breast cancer. After testing positive for the estrogen receptor  she was successfully treated with a medication that prevents estrogen synthesis.Jensen returned to Chicago with his wife in 1988. In 1990  he turned 70  which was the mandatory retirement age at the time. Jensen continued to do research and spent time at the National Institutes of Health  Cornell Medical College  the University of Hamburg and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. In 2002  he joined the University of Cincinnati where he was the George J. and Elizabeth Wile Chair in Cancer Research. He was able to continue his research there until late last year.Jensen retained a strong relationship with the University of Chicago. He was honored at a symposium held in 2001 marking the 50th anniversary of the Ben May Institute for Cancer Research and again in 2004 on the day his Lasker Award was anounced.“We all miss Elwood already ” said Geoffrey Greene  the Virginia and D. K. Ludwig Professor and Vice Chair of the Ben May Department for Cancer Research  who came to the Jensen lab as a post-doctoral student in 1974. “He was my mentor and had an enormous influence on my career and the careers of many investigators from around the world who spent time in his lab. He knew everything that was going on in the lab and the field of hormone action  but encouraged us to question existing dogma and follow our data. Despite his international reputation and stature in the field  he was very easy going  approachable and friendly.”Jensen is survived by his second wife and two children from his first marriage: Thomas Jensen  MBA  who lives in Ecuador; and Karen Jensen  a radiologist who graduated from the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine in 1977 and lives in New Hampshire.“He loved his work and was very devoted to the laboratory and to his scientific colleagues  but he was also a good father ” said Thomas Jensen  “He learned to ski in Switzerland and he taught my sister and me at a very early age. We skied together in the winters and spent many of our summers at a place we called Jensen Island  in the middle of Lake Meddybemps in Maine. When I think of my father  I imagine him at the lake cottage  hammering  fixing something.”The University of Cincinnati is arranging a memorial service in his honor in January 2013  and the University of Chicago is planning symposium in his honor next spring.
                    Robert Bork  jurist and scholar  1927-2012            ,Robert Bork  AB’48  JD’53  a former judge  law professor and Solicitor General of the United States who was nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court  died on Dec. 19. He was 85.Among legal scholars  Bork was known for his influential and serious scholarship in many areas  including antitrust law. Bork became known more widely to the public in 1987 when President Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court. The nomination failed amid controversy in the U.S. Senate  after which Bork returned to his work as an author and legal scholar.Bork received his bachelor’s degree from the College at UChicago in 1948. He matriculated at the Law School in the fall of 1948  but took a leave of absence for service in the military  returning to finish his degree in 1953. He served as an editor on theLaw Reviewand graduated Phi Beta Kappa and as a member of the Order of the Coif. Bork spent time at the Law School later in his career as a visiting faculty member and as a member of the Visiting Committee.Bork began his legal career in private practice  then became a professor at Yale Law School. His seminal scholarship on the application of economics to antitrust law was critical to both the scholarly and judicial understanding of that area. Bork served as Solicitor General of the United States from 1973 to 1977  arguing several important cases before the Supreme Court. In 1982  President Reagan appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  where he served until 1988. He was a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the Ave Maria School of Law.“Judge Bork was a great legal scholar ” saidMichael H. Schill  dean of the Law School and the Harry N. Wyatt Professor of Law. “His legacy to the world of law and economics and to antitrust law cannot be overstated  and we are proud that this legacy is deeply rooted in the education he got here at Chicago.”Schill added  “On a personal note  I am proud to say that I was a student of Judge Bork’s at Yale  and remember him as an extraordinary teacher. Many of my colleagues counted him as a mentor and a friend  and he will be deeply missed by all of us.”In June 2012  the University of Chicago honored Judge Bork with aProfessional Achievement Award. Judge Frank Easterbrook of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  who is both a Senior Lecturer at the Law School and a former assistant to Bork in the Solicitor General's Office  was one of his nominators. “Bob took an intellectual approach to his duties as Solicitor General ” said Easterbrook in that nomination. "It was never enough for him that some case pointed in a direction  or that a client agency wanted to go there. He thought that the United States always should ask why and explain the answer with care.”“Judge Bork had a distinguished career working in many areas ” saidRandal C. Picker  the Paul H. and Theo Leffmann Professor of Commercial Law and longtime teacher of antitrust law at the Law School. “For me  of course  his book The Antitrust Paradox stands out. It accomplished exactly what scholars aspire to but rarely achieve: serious  careful work with substantial  real-world influence.”Bork is survived by his wife Mary Ellen and their three children  Ellen  Robert and Charles.
                    Charles Rosen  music scholar and acclaimed pianist  1927-2012            ,Charles Rosen  an internationally acclaimed pianist and a distinguished scholar and author in music history and analysis  died Dec. 9 in New York. Rosen  professor emeritus in the John U. Nef Committee on Social Thought and Music  was 85.He was the author of numerous books in musicology  includingThe Classical Style: Haydn  Mozart  Beethoven  which won the National Book Award in 1972. The book is now translated into six languages and is considered essential reading for music students at universities and colleges throughout the United States.He joined the UChicago faculty in 1985 and taught one quarter each academic year. He retired in April 1996  at which time he gave a farewell concert.Anne Walters Robertson  the Claire Dux Swift Distinguished Service Professor in Music History and former chair of Music  called him “one of the greatest living concert pianists.”“His playing has links to the late-19th-century Romantic tradition that one does not always find in younger pianists ” she added.Throughout his academic career  Rosen was known for his scholarship in music.The New York Timescalled his 1995 book The Romantic Generation “That rarity: a work of detailed musical analysis that combines profound scholarship with artistic intuition.” The book  which stemmed from a series of lectures Rosen gave at Harvard University  traces the history of music from Beethoven’s death in 1827 to Chopin’s death in 1849. He also wroteThe Sonata Forms(1970)  which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.”What we appreciate most about Charles ” said Robertson at the time of his retirement  “is that his whole approach to music is that of an extremely accomplished performer. His strong scholarly skills and insights well up out of his musicianship.”Rosen began studying music at the age of 4  and he was enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music at 6. At 11  he began studying with Moritz Rosenthal  who was a pupil of Franz Liszt.Rosen received his PhD in French literature from Princeton University in 1951  the same year he made his critically acclaimed New York debut. As a result of that success  he chose a career in music.In addition to performing extensive concert tours throughout the world  he recorded for such labels as Sony and Nonesuch. Some of the most distinguished 20th-century composers called upon Rosen to record their works: Igor Stravinsky invited him to record “Movement for Piano and Orchestra ” and Elliott Carter invited him to record “Double Concerto.”Among his most highly acclaimed recordings are the three-record sets “The Last Keyboard Works of Johann Sebastian Bach” and “The Last Six Beethoven Sonatas.” He received a Grammy Award nomination for his recording of Beethoven’s “Diabelli Variations.”He was a member of the American Philosophical Society. Among the awards and honors he has received is the George Peabody Medal for Outstanding Contributions to American Music from the Johns Hopkins University.
                    Marshall D. Sahlins  titan of anthropology  1930–2021            ,Marshall D. Sahlins  an eminent cultural anthropologist of the Pacific known for sparking lively academic debates  died April 5. He was 90.Renowned for his prolific contributions to anthropology  Sahlins was the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago. For decades  he studied the history and ethnography of communities in Hawaii  Fiji and other islands in the South Pacific during the period of European contact—engaging his research with indigenous political structures  modes of kinship and conceptions of nature.For Sahlins  anthropology was both a privilege and an adventure  offering an opportunity to “reproduce within one’s mind the way the world is put together for other people ” he said during a2014 appearanceat the Chicago Humanities Festival.“Anthropology  in some ways  has an even better chance of truth than physics—because truth is human  and so are you ” Sahlins added inan interview last year.Born Dec. 27  1930  in Chicago  Sahlins received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1951 and 1952  and his doctorate from Columbia University in 1954. He joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1973  after teaching at Michigan for more than 15 years and working in Paris for two.Over the course of his career  Sahlins sought to de-center Western epistemic paradigms in anthropology  challenging ideas from sociobiology and capitalist economic theory by contending that cultural factors—as opposed to biology and self-interested competition—were key to shaping patterns of human behavior and development.French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss  himself called a father of modern anthropology  once wrote of Sahlins: “He now stands as a sage among anthropologists  maybe the last one.”Famous for his love of academic discourse  for several years Sahlins publicly debated Princeton University scholar Gananath Obeyesekere about the way indigenous Hawaiians perceived British explorer James Cook during the series of encounters that ultimately led to Cook’s death.The debate raised important questions about whether and how Western scholars should understand indigenous viewpoints.“Sahlins made fundamental contributions to the anthropology of history  economy and culture ” wrote Prof. Joseph P. Masco in a message to UChicago’s Department of Anthropology  which he chairs. “His enduring interest was to show how cultural difference works in history and how history shapes culture  and to argue for the fundamental value and rigor of indigenous modes of thought.”In addition to his academic work  Sahlins was politically active throughout his life. As an anti-war activist  in 1965 heoriginatedthe concept of the teach-in  a form of nonviolent protest that brought together students and faculty to question U.S. wars and policies. Teach-ins were widely emulated across the country during the Vietnam War.Sahlins is remembered by colleagues and former students for his wit  humor and generosity.“That he combined such humility with a famous pugnaciousness is perhaps a paradox  but I think those who worked closely with him would agree with me that the latter never eclipsed the former ” said Daniel Rosenblatt  PhD’03  now a professor of anthropology at Carleton University. “One of my favorite jokes of his was about the nature of an academic career: ‘In the long run ’ he said  ‘We all die and we are all wrong. A good career is when the former happens before the latter.’ For me at least  he (mostly) achieved that.”“Despite being one of the best known and most influential anthropologists of all time  Marshall was incredibly down-to-earth as a person ” said Rice University anthropologist Dominic Boyer  AM’94  PhD’00. “He treated his students with respect and warmth and loved to reminisce  joke and laugh. What I learned above all from him is that you don’t have to sacrifice being a well-rounded and caring person to be very good at what you do.”Alex Golub  AM’97  PhD’06  a former student who now teaches at the University of Hawaii  added: “The world would be a better place if everyone had Marshall’s clarity and integrity.”
                    Don R. Swanson  information science pioneer  1924–2012            ,Don R. Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson  a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages  thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.A trailblazing information scientist  Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.Concerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity  Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery  which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University’s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries—what he called “undiscovered public knowledge.”In 2000  Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit  the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology  for his work.Arrowsmith: ‘An intellectual adventure’Swanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud’s disease  a circulatory disorder.In a search of the Medline database  which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts  Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud’s disease; in a separate search  he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.The implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful:  could fish oil  Swanson wondered  be used to treat Raynaud’s disease?A clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud’s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.Spurred on by these findings  Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith  a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.Arrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a “systematic  computational” method to find possible links among articles  Smalheiser said. “The computer was not supposed to generate discoveries  but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.”The Arrowsmith model proved influential  and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.Despite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith  “We never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure ” Smalheiser said.‘Experiments with information’ not salamanders“Don was doing science  without dissecting a salamander ” said Mark Olsen  assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project  a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson’s work. “He was doing experiments with information.”Swanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD  also in physics  from the University of California  Berkeley  in 1952.Even in their early days  computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. “I think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer ” said his wife  Patricia Swanson.Swanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW  Inc.  before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school  who represented a variety of other disciplines.At the GLS  Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval  an entirely new area of study at the time.“At the time Don began working on it  people simply couldn’t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer ” said his colleague Abe Bookstein  professor emeritus in the Humanities. “In a field that was very qualitative  Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.”He was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher  according to his former GLS student Charles Blair  who remembered Swanson for his “very clean  organized and methodical approach to his subject.”Swanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project  Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. “He told me  ‘What this project needs is a little sunshine and water ” remembered Morrissey  the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. “He was very generous with his time.”That generosity was not unusual for Swanson  according to Smalheiser—Swanson went “out of his way to be nice and encouraging ” Smalheiser said.Swanson’s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles  for example  “New Horizons in Psychoanalysis:  Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders ” inPerspectives in Biology and Medicine(1986).Not only intellectually witty but also physically fit  Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.But his work was by far his greatest passion  according to Patricia Swanson. “He was always trying to do something better ” she said.In addition to his wife  Swanson is survived by his son  Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter  Judith A. Swanson  PhD’87. Another son  Douglas A. Swanson  died in 2004.In lieu of flowers  donations in Swanson’s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library  the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation.
                    Shannon Delaney  Career Advancement Administrator: 1977–2012            ,Shannon Delaney was a tireless supporter of the students  staff and alumni at the University of Chicago in her role as associate director of administration and planning in the office of Career Advancement. Delaney  35  died of natural causes at her home in Chicago on Friday  Nov. 9.[view:story=block_3=161900]Delaney came to the University in 2010 and embraced the Career Advancement mission of helping students and alumni prepare for professional success across all fields.“Higher education was Shannon’s passion  and she was incredibly dedicated to helping the students be as successful as possible ” said Meredith Daw  director of the office of Career Advancement. “She cared a lot for the people in our office  and loved supporting the students in multiple ways.”Delaney was originally from the rural town of Boxford  Mass.  and felt drawn to helping young people even in high school  when she volunteered as a Big Sister to vulnerable children. As an undergraduate at Goucher College in Baltimore  when she worked in the office of student activities  she discovered that she was particularly well-suited to working with college students. Delaney pursued a Masters of Higher Education Administration at the University of Delaware  and interacted with hundreds of students as a director in the on-campus residence life system.Her former classmate and friend Joanne Legler  who now works as associate director of admissions at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business  said it was a perfect fit for a woman who loved to guide and mentor young people as they experienced the changes of college life. “We interacted with the students in so many ways  from programming activities to crisis management ” Legler said. “Shannon really found her niche there.”Delaney moved to Chicago in 2006  and quickly created a rich community of friends in her new home. Legler recalls that Delaney would arrange Sunday brunch every week with a group of five girlfriends  and often organized trips to outdoor concerts  movies and events around the city.“She was a natural hostess  and planned Thanksgiving dinner with her adopted family of friends in Chicago every year ” Legler said. Delaney had plans to again host a group of friends  including her boyfriend of two years  for Thanksgiving dinner at her home next week.Delaney was an avid runner and raised money for the American Cancer Society through the Chicago Half Marathon  motivated by the loss of a close friend to cancer at a young age. “Cancer research is a cause that was near to Shannon’s heart ” said her mother  Christine Delaney.When Delaney joined Career Advising and Planning Services (now Career Advancement)  her talents with students quickly made her an integral part of the program.“Shannon was a considerate and thoughtful colleague  and her diligent work behind the scenes was crucial to the programming and support that students receive from Career Advancement ” said Daw.Delaney would often bring in treats for the staff on particularly busy days  Daw recalled  and celebrated the successes of everyone in the office.“Shannon loved her job  and she loved Chicago ” her mother said.Funeral services are planned for Monday  Nov. 19 in Topsfield  Mass. The University will hold a memorial service in Delaney’s honor at a date to be determined.
                    Susan Michal Fisher  noted psychiatrist  1937-2012             ,Susan Michal Fisher  BS’59  a distinguished psychiatrist and a former clinical professor in Psychiatry and Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago  was particularly adept at understanding the needs of people suffering under a variety of conditions. Fisher  74  a resident of Hyde Park  died June 21.Her life will be celebrated during at a memorial service at 6 p.m. Oct. 7 at the Women’s Club of Evanston  1708 Chicago Ave. in Evanston.She was the widow ofProf. Herman Sinaiko  a celebrated philosopher and well-loved faculty member at UChicago. He died in October 2011.“Susan inspired many students with her strong commitment to psychoanalysis and related therapies in this increasingly pharmacological world ” said Richard P. Taub  the Paul Klapper Professor and chair of Comparative Human Development.Added Martha McClintock  the David Lee Shillinglaw Distinguished Service Professor in Psychology: “Fisher could ‘see’ people: their character  their foibles  their strengths  pain  motivations and joys. She was not only a brilliant clinician in the grand psychoanalytic tradition  but passed on the skills and art as a beloved teacher and mentor.” More broadly she was nationally known and honored in her field.Early in her career Fisher worked with extremely challenging populations: as a therapist at Walpole Maximum Security Prison  as the chief psychiatrist for a children’s pretrial detention center in Washington  D.C.  and as the medical liaison for the burn unit of Children’s Hospital  also in Washington. She also worked with communities in rural China and Africa.“Knowing how wonderful a life could be  made her more keenly aware of — and eager to relieve — the suffering of others. She spent a lifetime refining her skills as a physician and psychiatrist so that she would be of the greatest possible service ” said her friend Penny Mesic.Fisher was born Nov. 15  1937 in New York and received a BS from the University of Chicago in 1959. She received an MD from Columbia University in 1963 and worked as a psychiatrist at Massachusetts Mental Health Center Boston  Beth Israel Hospital  Boston  and Children’s Hospital of the District of Columbia.She graduated from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1987 and served there as a faculty member.In 1979  she was named lecturer and consultant in psychiatry at UChicago. In 1999 she was named a clinical professor in Psychiatry and Comparative Human Development.She also held positions at Rush Medical School  Tufts Medical School and Harvard Medical School.She was the co-author of two books on topics close to her heart:To Do No Harm: DES and the Dilemmas of Modern Medicine andTalking with Young Children About Adoption. The former book  which Fisher co-authored with Roberta J. Apfel  concerned DES  or diethylstilbestrol  a synthetic estrogen that caused numerous medical problems  including birth defects.Despite a full professional career and a lively personal life  Fisher managed to read widely and collect an astonishing quantity of information. Friends said they marveled at her mind and how much it held—long poems memorized by heart  a compendious grasp of the music she loved  the lyrics of songs  the cabinet members of deposed Rumanian dictators  all the steps of the carbon cycle  the Latin names of tiny facial muscles  friends said.“When Susie contracted an illness that initially robbed her of memory  it was like witnessing the burning of the library at Alexandria—so much knowledge in one place  suddenly upturned  scattered  gradually reassembled but with a few gaps on the shelves ” Mesic said.But it was at this point that her lifelong courage was most evident. She did not complain or lapse into self-pity  Mesic added. “She knew who she was  she knew what it was to be strong and brave  and to a good friend to people  and she was those things.”Fisher’s intelligence and judgment were still healthy despite some memory problems  friends said. Mesic said Fisher took great solace from her husband  who helped her through difficult periods.“Herman Sinaiko’s death in the autumn of 2011 was a mortal blow ” Mesic said. “Trying to endure his loss was a pointless exercise  and her death from heart failure followed relatively soon after  bringing to a close a life that held abundant love and many triumphs.”She is survived by two children  Benjamin Jacob Sinaiko and Jane Rebecca Sinaiko  and by her granddaughter  Addison Rose Hagen.In lieu of flowers. the family asks that donations be made toDoctors Without Borders  PO Box 5030  Hagerstown  MD 21741-5030  orThe Center for Victims of Tortureat 649 Dayton Ave.  St Paul  MN 55104.
                    Philosopher Leonard Linsky  1922-2012            ,Leonard Linsky’s contributions to philosophy went beyond his pioneering work in the philosophy of language. For colleagues and generations of students  Linsky was a passionate interlocutor whose joy in discussing his field was both obvious and infectious.“He would talk about philosophy with anybody  all the time ” his son Bernard Linsky said.Linsky died Aug. 27 at the age of 89.[view:story=block_1]His landmark books—Referring(1967) Names and Descriptions(1977)  andOblique Contexts(1983)—were influential explorations of how names and descriptive expressions can be used to talk about real-world objects and phenomena  a central issue in the philosophy of language.He edited the 1952 collectionSemantics and the Philosophy of Language  an anthology that brought together seminal texts in the philosophy of language and helped “establish the canon in the field at mid-20th century ” said Michael Kremer  the Mary R. Morton Professor of Philosophy.Later in his career  Linsky delved more deeply into the history of modern logic and early analytic philosophy  with a particular focus on the work of Gottlob Frege  Bertrand Russell  and Ludwig Wittgenstein.Linsky was notable for his ability to clearly articulate the central issues at the heart of his field  according to his colleagues. “People would take his presentation of problems as a starting point for finding the solutions ” said Bernard Linsky  a professor of philosophy at the University of Alberta.While he would ultimately advance his own opinions  said William Tait  Professor Emeritus in Philosophy  “I always felt that the main thing for him was to clearly understand the issues. Talking with him was very therapeutic in this respect ” Tait editedEarly Analytic Philosophy: Frege  Russell  Wittgenstein: Essays in Honor of Leonard Linsky  a collection that grew out of a 1992 conference on the occasion of Linsky's retirement.Linsky received his BA  MA  and PhD from the University of California  Berkeley. He taught at the University of Illinois prior to teaching at Chicago.After a sabbatical in Europe in the 1970s  Linsky developed a keen interest in Italian art  architecture  and culture  and looked forward to summer trips to Florence and Tuscany. He also enjoyed classical music and concerts by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Yet his friends and colleagues say that Linsky’s true passion was philosophy  and his interest in the subject was endless  according to his longtime friend Tait.“Generations of his colleagues and students had the pleasure of chance encounters—in coffee shops  on the streets  wherever—that turned into lively discussions of his latest philosophical preoccupations ” Tait said.Linsky enjoyed attending get-togethers with graduate students in the department  though he tended to skip the small talk. He spent hours in the Nonesuch Coffee Shop on the fourth floor of Wieboldt Hall  sitting on the floor when there was no space at the tables  talking nonstop with students about their research.So beloved was Linsky among his colleagues and students that the philosophy department’s intramural basketball team proudly bore the name “Leonard Linsky’s All-Stars ” according to team member Eric Schliesser  PhD’02.Schliesser got to know Linsky over long conversations in the Classics Café and the Bonjour Bakery  and found him to be a source of “endless  fascinating anecdotes about the department and the giants of analytical philosophy from earlier generations.“Philosophy was the oxygen of his life  even though it was not his whole life ” Schliesser said.Kremer remembered Linsky as “a gracious and generous colleague  even in retirement. He was a lovely man and a great philosopher  and I will miss him.”Leonard Linsky is survived by his sons Bernard and Harry; granddaughters Andrea  Ruth and Jean; niece Jessica Spanos; and his companion Alexandra Bellow. He was preceded in death by his wife Joan Linsky (née Gregg) in 2001. Donations in Linsky’s honor may be made to the Department of Philosophy  1115 E. 58th St.  Chicago  IL 60637.
                    Divinity School student Joshua Casteel  1979-2012            ,Update:A memorial service for Joshua Casteel will be held at 5 p.m. on Friday  Nov. 9 on the third floor of Swift Hall.Joshua Casteel  a graduate student at the University of Chicago’s Divinity School  died Aug. 25 in New York City after battling lung cancer. He was 32.In addition to his academic work at the Divinity School  Casteel was an active member ofIraq Veterans Against the War. He lectured widely about his time as an interrogator at Baghdad’s Abu Ghraib prison and his decision to become a conscientious objector."There is simply no one like Joshua Casteel and the Divinity School community is keenly grieved at his loss ” said Margaret M. Mitchell  the Shailer Mathews Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature  and dean of the Divinity School. “This remarkable man  with such a remarkable history  who was our student  colleague  passionate interlocutor and friend  has left his mark here and will be continually remembered with fondness and admiration."A native of Cedar Rapids  Iowa  Casteel joined the Army Reserves at age 17 and attended the University of Iowa on an ROTC Scholarship. He served with the Army’s 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion as an Arabic translator and interrogator.At Abu Ghraib  Casteel’s pacifist views solidified  a transformation he described in the documentary“Soldiers of Conscience.”During an interrogation  a 22-year-old self-proclaimed jihadist suggested that Casteel was not following his own Christian faith. “[He said] I wasn’t fulfilling the call to turn the other cheek  to love one’s enemies ” Casteel said. “When posed with that kind of challenge  I had nothing I could say to him. I absolutely agreed with him. My position as a U.S. Army interrogator contradicted my calling simply as a Christian.”Casteel applied for conscientious objector status and was honorably discharged from the Army in May 2005.After returning to civilian life  Casteel studied at the Iowa Playwright’s Workshop  where he received his MFA. He is the author of two plays about his experiences in Iraq ReturnsandThe Interrogation Room  as well asLetters from Abu Ghraib(Essay Press  2008)  a collection of e-mails he wrote while serving in Iraq.He enrolled at the Divinity School in 2010  where his scholarly interests included theology  philosophy  and religion and literature. Although his illness prevented Casteel from completing his MA  he “achieved distinctive clarity in a very short span ” according to his advisor  Richard Rosengarten  Associate Professor in the Divinity School.“Few have written with such a combination of dignity  strength  and vulnerability about the experience of waging war in Iraq.  We're diminished in our loss  but ennobled and very grateful in memory of him ” Rosengarten added.Casteel greeted his diagnosis with strength and grace  according to his roommate Aaron Hollander  a PhD student in the Divinity School. “He didn’t sit around asking why. He didn’t treat it as an unfair reality ” Hollander said. “He decided he would rise above the illness and treat it as a chance to connect with people.”Despite his difficult treatment  Casteel even continued to teach a graduate writing workshop at Columbia College during his illness.His friends from UChicago remember Casteel for his passionate intellectualism both in and out of the classroom. He could often be found sitting outside Swift Hall with a stack of books  ready to engage in “rich  deep” conversations with whoever came by  according to his friend Michael Le Chevallier  a PhD student in the Divinity School.“Josh came most to life when he was vigorously debating ideas ” Le Chevallier said.Yet his friends also recall Casteel’s lighthearted side and winking sense of humor. Casteel  who rooted for Notre Dame  was equally comfortable discussing college football and 19th-century Russian philosophy  often simultaneously. A man of many talents  he made “the best guacamole I’d ever had  and was always willing to share ” Hollander remembered.During his time at UChicago  Casteel developed a keen interest in personalism  a theological worldview that places particular significance on subjectivity and relationships.“Josh didn’t merely understand personalism  he lived his philosophy ” Hollander said. “You can see that in the overflowing of love towards him from all over the country and all over the world. He was a force in people’s lives  and they came out of the woodwork to support him.”Casteel is survived by his mother  Kristi  and his sisters Naomi and Rebekah.

                    Donald Liu  pediatric surgeon  1962-2012            ,Donald Liu  section chief of pediatric surgery and surgeon-in-chief at the University of Chicago Medicine’s Comer Children’s Hospital  drowned Sunday  Aug. 5  after attempting to rescue two children who were caught in a strong current in Lake Michigan near the town of Lakeside  Mich. He was 50 years old.Liu  the Mary Campau Ryerson Professor in Surgery and Pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine  was internationally recognized for his expertise in applying and adapting the techniques of minimally invasive surgery to children. He developed innovative approaches to the treatment of chronic abdominal pain syndromes in children  including median arcuate ligament syndrome  a little-known and underdiagnosed disorder. As a researcher  he was an expert in Hirschsprung’s disease  the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis and the importance of gut bacteria in health and disease. His skill and experience attracted patients from all over the country.“Don Liu was full of life and energy and excitement for his specialty  a devoted doctor and a family man ” said Jeffrey Matthews  professor and chairman of surgery at the University of Chicago Medicine. “He was all about the children  and his enthusiasm inspired colleagues and the whole staff at Comer Children’s Hospital. That he died the way he lived  while saving children  is somehow consistent and heart-wrenching at the same time.”The two 12-year-old boys were struggling in choppy waters  according to the Chikaming Township Police Department. Liu “saw the children were in trouble and immediately went out into the water to help them ” said Bruce McKamey  a patrolman with the Chikaming Township police. The children made it to shore  but the surgeon was swept away by the rip current  he said.“This is a man that would wake up at 2 o’clock in the morning  be in the operating room in 10 or 15 minutes  literally save a child’s life who was bleeding to death from trauma — a car accident  gunshot wound  a beating ” said colleague John Alverdy  professor and vice chairman of surgery at the University of Chicago Medicine. “Then he would go home and go back to sleep. An hour later he would wake up  come to the OR  operate for five hours  maybe grab some lunch  go to another hospital and save another life — all in a day’s work.”Liu touched many lives as a master clinician and researcher who always put his patients and their families first  said colleagues.“He was passionate about his work as a pediatric trauma surgeon  both in treating and preventing childhood injury ” said Kenneth S. Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division and the Pritzker School of Medicine and executive vice president of medical affairs at the University of Chicago. “He had also created wonderful relationships with physicians and hospitals throughout the greater Chicago area  providing expertise and guidance in treating young patients.”'One of the best in the field'A prolific scholar  Liu was an author or co-author of more than 70 research publications  and eight book chapters  primarily dealing with minimally invasive surgery  the human microbiome and the surgical treatment of intestinal disease. He lectured all over the world  especially in China  and contributed to seven instructional films for various surgical societies. He was the principal investigator for multiple clinical trials and for two large grants from the National Institutes of Health  looking at treatments for necrotizing enterocolitis and the establishments of the gut microbiome in young children.“If you were a baby’s mother  this is the doctor you would want to care for your child from beginning to end ” Alverdy said. “He was compassionate  funny  unquestionably competent — one of the best in the field — a paragon of clinical excellence and an outstanding human being.”His wife  Dana Suskind  professor of surgery and pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine and director of the Pediatric Cochlear Implantation Program at Comer Children’s Hospital  described him as a loving father. “He was the best husband and father you can imagine ” she said.Liu was born in New York on Feb. 12  1962  but grew up in Taiwan. He went to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore  graduating with honors in 1984 with a bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences. He received his medical degree with high honors and his PhD in immunology from Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia in 1990. He completed his internship and residency in general surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 1995  followed by a two-year fellowship in pediatric surgery at the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital.From 1997 to 2001  Liu was an assistant professor of surgery at Louisiana State University School of Medicine  caring for patients at the Children’s Hospital of New Orleans. In 2001  Liu joined the University of Chicago Department of Surgery as a pediatric surgeon. He was named section chief of pediatric surgery and surgeon-in-chief at Comer Children’s Hospital in 2007.Liu won many honors  including teaching awards from the University of Pennsylvania  the Children’s Hospital of New Orleans and the University of Chicago  where he recently won a Distinguished Senior Clinician Award. He was routinely selected for local and national lists of top doctors  including byChicago Magazinein January.Liu also helped develop a formal affiliation between the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Hospital and the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center through Project Hope. This collaborative effort has helped train several international fellows who have gone on to become institutional leaders in China. As a result  Liu was honored with an endowed chair at Jiao Tong University/Shanghai Second Medical College. He also was given $300 000 for the “1000-Person Distinction” award by the Shanghai government recognizing collaborative clinical  research and educational efforts.In addition to his wife  Liu is survived by their three children: Genevieve  13  Asher  10  and Amelie  7; and a sister  Diana Liu  who is a corporate lawyer in Washington  D.C.Funeral services are being planned for noon on Wednesday  Aug. 8 at KAM Isaiah Israel Congregation  1100 E. Hyde Park Blvd.  Chicago. Liu will be buried wearing University of Chicago Medicine surgical scrubs and holding a White Sox baseball  a video game and his children's pictures. A memorial service on the UChicago campus is being planned for later this year.In lieu of flowers  donations should be sent to theDr. Don Liu Memorial Fund  University of Chicago Medicine & Biological Sciences Development  Attn: Abbe Temkin  130 E.

                    Ernest Page  cardiac muscle biologist  1927-2012            ,Ernest Page  professor emeritus in Medicine and Neurobiology  Pharmacology and Physiology  died from complications of long-term neuromuscular disease on July 21 at his home in Jerusalem. He was 85.Page  a member of the Committee on Cell Physiology atthe University of Chicago Medicine  was a pioneer in using the electron microscope to study biological processes and in developing rigorous mathematical techniques to analyze highly magnified images to understand the biology of heart-muscle cells and the diseases that impair heart function.He was especially interested in the changes that occurred at the subcellular level. His early work focused on ventricular hypertrophy  a precursor to heart failure  and on how various drugs could alter the ability of cardiac muscle to contract. Later in his career  he focused on cardiac ion channels and the structure and function of cardiac gap junctions — clusters of channels that allow current-carrying ions to pass between cells  allowing electrical propagation of cardiac contraction.“He pioneered microscopic and biochemical studies on gap junctions that form the basis of some of my current research and that of many cardiovascular scientists ” said cancer specialist Eric Beyer  professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medicine. “The field didn’t care much about these cell-to-cell connections in the heart at the time; they were seen as passive. But he persisted  purified cardiac gap junctions and provided data that helped convince others that they were fundamental for understanding electrical conductance within the heart and abnormalities that cause arrhythmias.”Page also did fundamental studies of atrial natriuretic peptide  a hormone secreted by muscle cells in the upper heart chambers in response to high blood pressure. This peptide can lower blood pressure by reducing the amounts of water  sodium and lipids in the blood. Page and colleagues showed that atrial natriuretic peptide was stored in small flask-shaped pockets in the atrial cell membranes  called caveolae  and that it was released in response to stretching of the inner walls of the atria.“Ernest Page was a key figure in the effort  soon after World War II  to apply emerging scientific tools such as electron microscopy to biological problems at the sub-cellular level ” said Harry Fozzard  professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine. “He was among the first to apply electron microscopy to the study of cardiac tissue. His work directly affected how we understand and treat certain forms of heart disease.”One of Page’s best-known early mouse studies from the early 1970s showed how specific structures within heart muscle cells adapted to physical stress. When the aorta was partially constricted  cardiac muscle cells began to enlarge in as little as 10 days. Within each cell  he found myofibrils  the structures responsible for energy consumption  increased. At the same time  mitochondria  the structures that produce the fuel used by myofibrils to contract  decreased. This process  he wrote at the time  “may well be implicated in the ultimate development of heart failure.”“Ernest Page was an internationally renowned physiologist and electron-microscopist ” said Rory Childers  professor of medicine at UChicago. “He was the first of those recruited by Hans Hecht  chief of cardiology in the 1960s  to build a team of scientists who would work closely with the clinicians to learn more about cardiac diseases and to use that knowledge to develop more effective therapies.”A popular teacher and respected researcherDespite his accomplishments  Page’s wife said he was a modest person who loved culture.“He liked to stay out of the limelight ” Eva Page said. “But he was also a Renaissance man  a popular teacher as well as a respected researcher. He loved classical music. He read extensively  wrote poetry and completed three novels  none of them published. When he retired after 34 years at the University  he told everyone he had had a good time because he spent those years doing all the things he loved.”Ernest Page was born May 30  1927 in Cologne  Germany. Because his father was “a prominent lawyer  a Jew and a Social Democrat ” said Page’s son  David  the family “needed to flee Germany” soon after the Nazis came to power. They went to Paris in 1935  and then moved to San Francisco about a year later.In 1945  when he turned 18  Page was drafted into the U.S. Army. After World War II  he earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1949  followed by his medical degree from the University of California at San Francisco in 1952. He did his residency training at the Harvard-affiliated Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston  with additional fellowships in heart research at the University of Alabama  enzyme chemistry at the University of Wisconsin and biophysics at Harvard Medical School.After completing his clinical training in 1958  Page was awarded a biophysics research fellowship at Harvard. A year later he was appointed an American Heart Association Established Investigator at that university  from 1959 to 1964. At Harvard  he became an instructor of biophysics in 1961 and an associate in biophysics in 1963.Page came to UChicago in 1965 as an associate professor. He quickly built a large cardiac muscle biology research program. He was promoted to professor in 1969.‘I consider myself to be very lucky’Page also made a different sort of discovery in his Chicago laboratory: a technician named Eva Veronica Gross. She was a Romanian Jewish physician who had  in her words  “run away” to the West through Yugoslavia in 1965  during the Cold War  going first to Austria and then to Chicago. She began working in Page’s laboratory in 1966. They were married in 1967 and published one paper together  “Distribution of Ions and Water between Tissue Compartments in the Perfused Left Ventricle of the Rat Heart” in 1968. She completed her residency at what was then called the University of Chicago Hospitals and became a practicing dermatologist.On vacations  the two enjoyed combining extended nature hikes with “long  lovely talks ” she said.“In summers  we used to hike in the Rockies in Idaho and Colorado  which we both loved  going to relatively high altitudes where there were not many people  just the glorious nature and animals.”“He was a wonderful father  spending lots of valuable time with our son  and an exceptional husband ” she added. “I consider myself to be very lucky.”“Although he was an outstanding scientist  he always gave me the feeling that he and my mother were the center and most important part of his world ” said his son David. “I remember him daily with his arm draped around me while he read to me before I went to bed. When I was impudent or impolite to him  he never reacted with anger. He only reprimanded me when I was unkind or insensitive to others.”A prolific researcher  Page published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles and another 100 research abstracts. He played a leadership role in many of the local and national cardiology associations  serving as a member of the American Heart Association research committee and as chairman of the Chicago Heart Association research committee. From 1981 to 1986 he was editor of theAmerican Journal of Physiologyand from 1987 to 1991 he was associate editor forCirculation Research. He and two colleagues editedThe Handbook of Physiology: The Heartfor Oxford Press  published in 2001.After teaching physiology to medical students for 25 years  Page retired in 1998. He and his wife moved to Israel to be closer to their son. In addition to his wife  Page is survived by their son David and his wife Menucha  and four grandchildren: Daniela  Ben-Tzion  Betzalel and Elazar.A funeral service was held in Jerusalem.
                    Michel-Rolph Trouillot  scholar of Caribbean history  1949-2012            ,Michel-Rolph Trouillot  a professor of anthropology at UChicago and a leading authority on the dynamics of power across cultural boundaries  died July 5. He was 62.“Rolph touched many people  both personally and professionally. He had a deeply challenging  critical and caring mind and leaves behind an impressive scholarly legacy that extends beyond his published work ” said Greg Beckett  PhD’08   Collegiate Assistant Professor in the Social Sciences Division  of his former professor.“As a teacher and colleague he offered a model of compassionate  concerned and joyful intellectual inquiry. Rolph asked difficult questions  and he insisted others do the same. He opened new frontiers in the study of the Caribbean  but his impact extends far beyond the region. His work has significantly transformed our understanding of the role of power in the modern world. I am grateful to have known him and worked with him.”Trouillot joined the UChicago faculty in 1998 after serving as the Krieger/Eisenhower Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and director of the Institute for Global Studies in Culture  Power and History at Johns Hopkins University.Trouillot grew up in Haiti and came to the United States to join the Haitian exile community in New York during the years of Duvalier dictatorships in the late 1960s. Before beginning scholarly study  he was a songwriter and activist involved in political protest against the Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti and against the American government’s treatment of undocumented Haitian immigrants.He wrote an important book in Haitian Creole published in 1977  the year before he graduated from college:Ti Dife Boule sou Istoua Ayiti. The book was a history of the Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804.He received a BA in Caribbean history and culture from the City University of New York in 1978 and a PhD in anthropology from Johns Hopkins in 1985.He also studied the historical evolution of Caribbean peasantries  their inconsistent integration in the world economy and their role in the building of nationhood.He was the author and co-author of a number of other books  includingGlobal Transformations: Anthropology and the Modern World(2003) Open the Social Sciences(1996) Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History(1995) Haiti: State against Nation: The Origins and Legacy of Duvalierism(1990) andPeasants and Capital; Dominica in the World Economy(1988).The Caribbean Philosophical Association awarded him the 2011 Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award “for the originality of his interrogations in the human sciences  especially anthropology and history  and his articulation of the importance and challenges of Haiti in contemporary discussions of freedom and reclamations of the past.”Jean Comaroff  formerly a professor of anthropology at UChicago and now at Harvard University  said at the time: “There could be few more appropriate recipients of the Fanon prize than Michel-Rolph Trouillot. His life and work embody the brilliant  restless spirit of Fanon  carrying forward the long  searing conversation between Caribbean critique and the legacy of Western humanism.” Fanon  who grew up in Martinique  was a writer who influenced postcolonial studies.Yarimar Bonilla  PhD’08  a former student of Trouillot and an assistant professor of anthropology at Rutgers University  said  “It's hard to know how to mark the passing of someone who has so thoroughly transformed your life through both word and deed.“Rolph's work is the gold-standard for me intellectually  but he was also a deep personal inspiration: bold  charismatic  unabashed  unapologetic  and fully engaged with life's pleasures and ironies. He offered a model of an academic who never compromised on life  love or laughter. I don't think this was coincidental to the power of his work. His writing does not just inform — it inspires and transforms. He always encouraged his students to find their ‘burning questions’ to follow their passions as this was what would truly sustain them and feed not just their careers but their souls.”A service will be held in Port-au-Prince  Haiti. A public memorial at UChicago is being planned for the fall.
                    Max S. Bell  prolific educator and author of definitive math curriculum  1930–2021             ,Prof. Emeritus Max S. Bell  an influential scholar of mathematics education who co-authored the widely-used curriculumEveryday Mathematics  died March 6. He was 90.A longtime professor at the University of Chicago  Bell  AM’58  AMT’59  was known for his distinctive approach to improving math education that was grounded in real-world applications and an understanding of student experiences and capabilities built on research centered in the classroom.Prof. Bell’s work  which included longitudinal studies of math pedagogy and teacher training  was an expansion of the educational philosophy of John Dewey—the founder of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools—who viewed education as an essential tool for strengthening democracy and helping students reach their full potential.In 1974  Bell published a seminal paper inThe Mathematics Teacher  “What does ‘everyman’ really need from school mathematics? ” in which he articulated his belief that a useful math education would help shape students into confident  actively engaged civic participants.“With a clear idea of what we want for everyman ” he wrote  “we can instead be ‘accountable’ for what we believe can truly help human beings cope with their world.”Much of Bell’s work focused on the student educational experience in underserved schools on Chicago’s south and west sides. One study of Head Start students from pre-k through third grade showed that intuitive understanding of fundamental math concepts was common among students at a very early age  but deteriorated in elementary school due to a focus on rote memorization.By raising questions about how math curriculum could be reshaped to instead teach important concepts and pattern intuition in a way that would link math to everyday life  Bell fostered a rethinking of math education that had ripple effects across the discipline.“The ‘everyman’ paper may have been the most important one published in our field in that decade ” said Zalman Usiskin  an emeritus professor of education who directed the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project from 1987–2019 and worked closely with Bell for years.Bell furthered his ideas about better math education with the publication of the first edition of the K–6 curriculumEveryday Mathematics—the title of which nods to the “everyman” article—from 1988–1996. InEveryday Mathematics  Max and his wife and co-author Jean F. Bell created a framework for teaching elementary school students core math skills in an accessible way. The curriculum  now in its fourth edition  has been used by tens of millions of students over more than 30 years.Born in 1930 and raised in southern Idaho  Bell received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the University of California  Los Angeles in 1954  along with a teaching certificate. While at UCLA  he met his wife Jean  who would become a lifelong research partner.After beginning his career as a high school math teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area  Bell came to the University of Chicago as part of a National Science Foundation-supported institute for teachers  through which he earned master’s degrees in education in 1958 and mathematics teaching in 1959.In 1960  Bell received dual appointments as a teacher at the Laboratory Schools and a lecturer in the University’s Graduate School of Education  a pairing that began his career-long focus on both student and teacher education  research and curriculum development.
                    Charles Metz  pioneer in imaging science  1942-2012            ,Charles E. Metz  professor of radiology and a member of the Committee on Medical Physics at the University of Chicago Medicine  died from pancreatic cancer on July 4 at his home in Burr Ridge. He was 69 years old.Metz  a recognized leader in using mathematics to assess and improve the accuracy of diagnostic tests  made contributions to radiological imaging  nuclear medicine and computer-aided diagnosis. He developed the “Metz filter ” widely used to enhance resolution and remove distractions from nuclear-medicine images. He was perhaps best known for extending receiver operating characteristic analysis to the medical imaging field and for providing  free of charge  an extensive package of computer software to more than 10 000 registered users worldwide.Metz’s pioneering work is highly regarded and widely cited. He contributed to image collection  improved recovery of three-dimensional information from overlapping two-dimensional images  and applied novel evaluation methods to conventional and digital X-ray images. More recently  he focused on large-scale evaluation of computer-aided diagnosis in mammography  chest X-rays and CT scans.“Charles was a true scientist  educator and mentor of the highest caliber ” said Maryellen Giger  professor and vice chair for basic science research in the Department of Radiology  chair of the Committee on Medical Physics and director of the Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago Medicine. “He was one of the giants in elucidating the mathematical foundations of imaging science.”He also was an extraordinary teacher for colleagues as well as the students who came to him for advice. “Whether you were a tenured professor or an undergraduate  he could explain anything in the field in the most thorough and appropriate way ” recalled Giger  a former graduate student with Metz. “He would go through it with you until he was convinced you understood it.”Ronald Thisted  chairman of Health Studies at the University of Chicago Medicine  called him “an ideal colleague.”“He was generous with his time  especially with younger colleagues ” Thisted said. “He would consider your ideas or read your manuscript carefully and make valuable suggestions. His advice was always positive  encouraging and constructive.”Metz focused his attention on ROC analysis  which emerged during World War II for use with radar signals. It entered medical research in the late 1960s as an index of the accuracy and reliability of medical tests.“ROC provided radiologists with a way to objectively measure how data are presented in an image  how people perceive those images and how to compare different observers or different imaging modalities with each other ” said chest-imaging specialist Heber MacMahon  professor of radiology at the University of Chicago Medicine. “Charles adopted the theoretical principles from other fields and wrote the definitive papers applying ROC analysis to radiology. His work helps us make better clinical decisions from diagnostic images.”Charles Edgar Metz was born Sept. 11  1942  in Bay Shore  N.Y. His family moved to Freeport  Long Island  when he was 4 years old. He graduated with honors from Bowdoin College in Brunswick  Maine  with a bachelor’s degree in physics  followed by a master’s degree in 1966 and a PhD in radiological physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1969. He met his wife  also a graduate student  at Penn and they married in 1967. Although they divorced in 1987  they remained close friends.He came to UChicago soon after graduation as an instructor in Radiology and the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital  a campus facility sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission and dedicated to the study of atomic energy in the detection and treatment of cancer. He stayed at UChicago for the rest of his career  rising to assistant professor in 1971  associate professor in 1975 and professor in 1980. He served as director of the graduate programs in medical physics from 1979 to 1986 and on multiple institutional as well as national and international committees and advisory boards  including study sections for the National Institutes of Health.Metz published more than 250 scientific papers – one of which  “Basic principles of ROC analysis” – has been cited nearly 3 000 times since it was published in 1978  according to Google Scholar. He holds four patents for image-analysis tools. He served as an advisor for 38 doctoral students  many of whom are now leading figures in the field  and has presented more than 80 invited lectures throughout the United States  Europe and Japan.Metz received awards for teaching as well as research. He was named a fellow by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine in 2004 and honored with the L.H. Gray Medal from the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements at its Conference of Medical Physics in Nuremberg  Germany  in 2005 for his “fundamental contributions to basic and applied radiation science.”He was also an inspiring  generous  supportive and genuinely funny father and friend  his daughters pointed out. “Dad truly was as good as they come ” said his younger daughter Molly. “There are just not enough positive words to convey how special a man he was and the contributions he made.”He taught us “love  friendship  grace  courage  humility  humor  intelligence  compassion  gratitude  excellence  kindness  rock ‘n’ roll  cars  airplanes  family and much more ” wrote his other daughter Becky.His daughters and several colleagues cite Metz’s tendency to give impressively thorough answers  even to straightforward questions  such as those about algebra homework. “I love to learn ” Becky wrote  but “I did roll my eyes after a half-hour answer.”Metz was a fan of high-performance automobiles and an authority on World War II German aircraft  the machines that were the initial focus of ROC analysis. The forum for the Large Scale Aircraft Modelingwebsiteis dominated this week by the loss of “his incredible knowledge ” according to one commentator  “of all things aviation-related.”Metz is survived by his daughters  Molly Metz of Seattle  Wash.  and Becky Metz Mavon of Western Springs  Ill.; grandchildren Charlie  Avery and Oni; and former wife  Maryanne Metz of Chicago.A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday  Aug. 27 in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel  followed by a reception in Ida Noyes Hall's Cloister Club.
                    Joseph B. Kirsner  pioneer in gastroenterology  1909-2012            ,Update:A memorial service for Joseph B. Kirsner will be held Friday  Sept. 14 from 2-3:30 p.m. at Rockfeller Memorial Chapel. A reception will follow in the Quadrangle Club.Renowned gastroenterologist Joseph B. Kirsner  the Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine  died from kidney failure at his home in Chicago on July 7. He was 102.Kirsner was a pioneer in the understanding and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and a role model for physicians learning how to care for patients. He was a leader in understanding the immunology and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease and was one of the first to show the increased risk of colon cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis.“Few if any physicians have had a broader and more positive impact than Joe Kirsner on thousands of patients  students and professional colleagues ” said Kenneth S. Polonsky  dean of the Division of the Biological Sciences and the Pritzker School of Medicine and Executive Vice President of Medical Affairs at UChicago. “His legacy at the University of Chicago will persist for generations. We are truly fortunate to have been able to call Joe a friend and colleague and a member of our faculty.”Every gastroenterologist should feel “at least slightly indebted to Joe Kirsner ” said Stephen Hanauer  the Joseph B. Kirsner Professor of Medicine and section chief of gastroenterology at the University of Chicago Medicine.After coming to UChicago in 1935  Kirsner helped transform the field of gastroenterology from an art — in his words  “speculative  impressionistic  anecdotal  almost mystical at times” — into a science.Kirsner helped found the American Gastroenterological Association  the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. He also was a key player in the creation of the original General Medicine Study Section  a voluntary group of experts who advise the National Institutes of Health on the merits of grant applications.Kirsner made fundamental contributions to the field  Hanauer said. “He was among the first to demonstrate that stomach acid was necessary for ulcer development  and he drew attention to the complex relationships between bacteria in the gut and the immune system in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.”“He was also an extraordinary mentor  albeit a demanding one ” Hanauer said. “He was entirely devoted to the care of the patient  and he expected that same level of passion and commitment from the entire team.”As a central figure in the evolution of what was once a small specialty  Kirsner has received every major award in his field but one — for which he is not eligible — the American Digestive Health Foundation’s Joseph B. Kirsner Award. The Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation gave him their lifetime achievement award twice  in 1991 and 2002.“He was here for two lifetimes ” said Eugene Chang  the Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine. “He’s an icon in the field. Everyone knows him. He’s been a key player nationwide for so long that even those who have worked with him for decades only know pieces of his career. I’m not sure where the field would be without him. He was at the beginning of everything.”Kirsner also taught generations of medical students and young physicians the importance of combining competence with compassion when treating patients.“Although he was a devoted scientist  taking care of patients was always at the core of his thinking ” said David Rubin  associate professor of medicine and co-director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at UChicago. “He was a bulldog when it came to fighting for his patients  and he transmitted that tenacity to everyone on his team.”That approach led to an unusual doctor-patient relationship. In 1976  at the recommendation of Donald Fredrickson  then the director of the National Institutes of Health  Kirsner was asked to take care of King Hassan II of Morocco  who had complex digestive issues. Over the next 22 years  Kirsner made 55 trips to Morocco  providing care to more than 200 patients  including the king and many members of the royal family.Roots of his pioneering workThe oldest of five children  Joseph Barrett Kirsner was born in Boston on Sept. 21  1909  to Ukrainian Jewish parents who had immigrated to the United States. He grew up in Boston’s East End neighborhood  a foothold for recent immigrants. Throughout his adolescence  Kirsner held multiple jobs  delivering newspapers  stocking a grocery store and working as a library clerk. He then worked his way through a six-year program at Tufts University that combined college and medical school.He entered medical school in 1929  the week the stock market crashed. “My thought was to go through medical school as quickly as possible and start earning a living ” he recalled in a talk he presented at an IBD conference in 2004. He graduated near the top of his class in 1933 and  planning a career as a general practitioner  moved to Chicago for a two-year internship at Woodlawn Hospital on the South Side  with free room and board plus a salary of $25 a month.One of his patients  however  had grander ideas. Minnie Schneider  a young dancer with an ear infection  was hospitalized at Woodlawn. “She was a ballerina ” Kirsner recalled. “I fell totally in love with her.”She pushed him to choose a specialty soon after they were married in 1934.So he began attending lectures at UChicago. Walter Palmer  who had established the first academic gastroenterology unit in the United States in 1927  particularly impressed Kirsner. In August 1935  an entry-level faculty job opened up and Kirsner joined the hospital staff as an assistant in medicine with an annual salary of $1 000.He began working with Palmer  who was doing pioneering studies in stomach and intestinal disorders. He also began a PhD program in biology  which he completed in 1942. His wife gave up dancing for secretarial work to help with expenses.Kirsner’s early research involved peptic ulcers  stomach-acid secretion and body chemistry  which led to an unusual research collaboration. A penniless  homeless young man  known as Edwin R.  enrolled in one of Kirsner’s research studies. Edwin badly needed treatment. He also needed a job and a place to live  so Kirsner kept him hospitalized for an entire year as a patient and research subject and trained him to be a technician.“It would be difficult to gain approval for such an arrangement today ” Kirsner acknowledged  even though none of the studies put Edwin at risk  “but it was acceptable to him  and he helped me start some of my research. Everybody was happy.”In the late 1930s  Kirsner began shifting his focus to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Working initially with Palmer  Kirsner developed new methods to manage IBD patients. In the 1940s  he showed that patients with IBD  even mild cases  lost high levels of protein  a discovery that placed new emphasis on nutrition. He developed the first animal models of IBD  demonstrated the influence of the immune system and genetics on this disease  and documented the increased risk of colon cancer in patients with IBD.World War II forced Kirsner to put his research on hold. In 1943  he joined the U.S. Army as a physician. In August 1944  about 10 weeks after D-Day  his unit landed at Utah Beach  Normandy. They established bases at various hospitals in France and Belgium  one of which was hit by a German V-2 rocket. Over the next six months  Kirsner cared for U.S. soldiers with severe battle wounds  captured German officers and survivors of the Nazi concentration camps who had complex nutritional issues.Soon after VE Day  he was transferred to the Pacific Theater  where he advised on the rehabilitation of more prisoners of war  including a group of badly burned Dutch prisoners who were being held captive in Nagasaki in August 1945 when an atomic bomb obliterated much of the city. He was discharged in 1946 at the rank of major  with three battle stars.Devotion to his patientsBack at UChicago  Kirsner continued his research in IBD and rose steadily through the academic ranks. He became an associate professor in 1947  professor in 1951  chief of gastroenterology in 1960 and the Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine in 1968. In 1971  he was named the chief of staff and deputy dean for medical affairs.He published more than 750 scientific papers and 18 books  including six editions of his authoritative textbook Inflammatory Bowel Disease.The2004 edition of this text is 842 pages and weighs 4.4 pounds. He trained more than 200 of the field’s leading specialists. He continued to see patients until age 95; even then  former patients continued to call him for advice.Kirsner also helped raise funds for gastrointestinal studies. In 1962  a collection of his grateful patients formed the Gastro-Intestinal Research Foundation  which has provided nearly $30 million to support gastrointestinal research at the University  including $2 million for the University’s 17 000-square-foot Joseph B. Kirsner Center for the Study of Digestive Diseases  which opened in 1986.“In my opinion  and the opinion of most people involved with GIRF  without Dr. Joe  this group would ever have been possible ” said Sy Taxman  a longtime member of the GIRF board. “He leaves us all with a strong traction and big shoes to fill.”Kirsner did all this while focusing most of his attention on taking care of patients  one at a time. “Dr. Kirsner taught me to be a doctor’s doctor ” Hanauer said. “Never was a patient too difficult nor would he ever lose patience in caring for an individual.”Kirsner had little tolerance for doctors who did not share this devotion. “After nearly 70 years in the practice of medicine ” Kirsner wrote in a 2002 essay for theJournal of the American Medical Association  “I cannot condone the diminished sensitivity of physicians to patients.”His wife of 64 years  Minnie  died from complications associated with Parkinson’s disease and stroke in 1998.Kirsner is survived by his son Robert Kirsner  professor of linguistics at the University of California at Los Angeles  and his wife Elaine; their son Daniel  and daughter Rachel Kirsner Schneider and her husband Steve; and four great-grandchildren: Yaron  Gilad  Amira and Eden Schneider.A memorial service is being planned for later this summer. In lieu of flowers  contributions should be directed to the Gastro-Intestinal Research Foundation  70 E. Lake St.  Suite 1015  Chicago  IL 60601.
                    Joseph Cropsey  expert on political philosophy and esteemed teacher  1919-2012             ,Update:A memorial service will be held for Prof. Joseph Copsey beginning at 10 a.m. Saturday  Sept. 29 at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel.Joseph Cropsey  a UChicago professor who was one of the nation’s leading figures in the study of political philosophy  died July 1 in Rockville  Md. He was 92.Cropsey  a distinguished service professor emeritus in Political Science  was a beloved teacher at UChicago and wrote a series of important books in which he examined political science from ancient through modern times. He is particularly remembered for his work on Socrates  Plato and Adam Smith  and for his collaboration with famed UChicago political scientist Leo Strauss.Mary Nichols  PhD’75  likened the “profound effect” of Cropsey’s instruction on students to the Greek figure Meno falling under the wizardry of Socrates. “We entered a world of immense beauty and awe  where questions touching the essence of human life—of knowledge and virtue  of individual excellence and common good  or philosophy and politics—were directly before us ” said Nichols of Cropsey  who chaired her dissertation committee.“We were filled with a desire to engage in a lifelong task of exploring possible answers  their implications and ramifications  even if we could never come to any final resolution ” added Nichols  now a professor of political science at Baylor University.Cropsey was born in New York and received a BA in 1939 from Columbia University. A first lieutenant in the Army during World War II  he served in anti-aircraft artillery units in Hawaii  North Africa  Sicily  Italy and as a staff officer in France. He returned to Columbia after the war to complete a PhD in economics in 1952  writing his dissertation on the 18th-century British economist Adam Smith.It was in New York that he met Strauss  who joined UChicago’s political science department in 1949 and was one of the leading figures in the study of the history of political philosophy. A friend introduced them while Strauss was at the New School for Social Research.“My contact with Strauss was what directed me toward the literature of political philosophy. I used to go to his courses down at the New School for a couple of years  and it just won me over ” Cropsey saidin an interview with the UChicago publicationDialogoin 2007.Cropsey taught at the City College of New York and the New School before joining the UChicago faculty in 1958. He came to Chicago as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow in 1957 to work with Strauss and joined the faculty the following year.Strauss encouraged Cropsey to examine texts deeply. “When Strauss was at the head of his class  sitting up there  he would at a certain point say  ‘What does this mean?’ When I have to deal with a text of Plato  I have constantly to be asking myself  ‘What does that truly mean?’ Until one comes to grips with the question  one has not done one’s duty to the object or to oneself ” he toldDialogo.Working with Strauss  he co-edited and contributed to theHistory of Political Philosophy  first published in 1962 and reissued in 1972 and 1987. He was also the author or editor of a number of important books:Polity and Economy: An Interpretation of the Principles of Adam Smith(1957);Ancients and Moderns; Essays on the Tradition of Political Philosophy in Honor of Leo Strauss(1964);Hobbes’s A Dialogue Between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England(1971);Political Philosophy and the Issues of Politics(1977); andPlato’s World: A Man’s Place in the Cosmos(1995).He was particularly proud to see his final book On Humanity’s Intensive Introspection published before his death.Cropsey’s writing illuminated the limits and potential resources of modern liberalism  and in his later years  came to focus on the problem of Socrates and the implications of his philosophic sobriety for understanding humanity’s place in the whole.He retired in 1990  but continued to teach until 2004.Cropsey had an enormous influence on the profession of political science  both in the United States and abroad  serving as a committee member for 134 PhD dissertations — of which he chaired 76. The Department of Political Science awards the Joseph Cropsey Prize for Master’s Thesis in Classical and Political Philosophy annually in his honor.Cropsey was also a beloved teacher of thousands of undergraduates  and in 1970 he received the University’s Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. Cropsey said upon receiving the Quantrell Award that he enjoyed teaching Plato and Aristotle to a generation of students focused on finding relevancy in their classes. “Students are quick to realize that things that happened 2 000 years ago can have as much relevancy to their lives as something that happened yesterday ” he said.Christopher Colmo  PhD’79  chair of Political Science at Dominican University  said  “What inspired me most about Joseph Cropsey as a teacher was his practice of taking a fresh look at the problem  of asking again  really asking  the questions of which one had already disposed. That  in my eyes  is something to aspire to.”Cropsey is survived by daughter Rachel Simons  son Seth Cropsey  and two grandsons and a granddaughter. He was preceded in death in 2006 by his wife Lilian.
                    Elsie M. Pinkston  distinguished expert on child welfare  1937-2012            ,Elsie M. Pinkston  professor emerita at theSchool of Social Service Administrationand a nationally recognized authority on child welfare and parental interactions  died May 31. She was 74.At SSA  she directed the Program Procedures Project in child welfare and previously directed the Elderly Support Project and the Parent Partnership Program  as well as programs in parent education and home-based parent training.“The legacy Elsie bestowed upon SSA is twofold: first  the ethical imperative to use empirical methods to inform social work practice at all levels  as well as a generosity of spirit  which made her a valued mentor to countless master’s and doctoral students ” said Tina Rzepnicki  the David and Mary Winton Green Professor at SSA.Pinkston received her undergraduate degree in 1969 and a PhD in 1973 in developmental and child psychology  both from the University of Kansas. She joined the SSA faculty in 1973  where she co-founded the Applied Behavior Analysis Course Sequence.She was the lead author of books on behavioral methods and case studies in social work:Effective Social Work Practice andCare of the Elderly: A Family Approach. She was also co-editor ofEnvironment and Behavior.As a pioneer in behavioral social work practice  she published in theJournal of Applied Behavioral Analysis Behavior Therapy The Gerontologist Social Service ReviewandSocial Work.The Child Welfare League of America published an ethics manual Ethical Child Welfare Practice  Volume 1: Clinical Issues  developed in collaboration with her staff and the Office of Inspector General  IDCFS.Pinkston consulted internationally on behavioral family treatment  and her work has been translated into Norwegian  Spanish  Portuguese  Polish and Japanese.Pinkston committed herself to her clinical research with the elderly  children  families served in state institutions  and community-based organizations  colleagues said. A variety of national and federal fellowships and grants supported her research on effectiveness of parent training  family care giving and the elderly  and child welfare practices with African American children  adolescents and families.In addition to research and teaching  she advocated for children’s rights on committees for the Illinois’ DCFS  the American Civil Liberties Union Advisory Committee on the DCFS Family Court  and as a federal court monitor advisor in a case involving DCFS.During her time at SSA  she was a devoted contributor to both student’s learning and the development of SSA’s curriculum. She also was an integral designer of SSA’s courses demonstrating the usefulness of behavioral procedures in clinical practice.Pinkston retired from SSA in June 2002. The following year  her former students and colleagues  along with peer researchers and close friends  paid her tribute  hosting a national research symposium at UChicago.Many of the products of that highly successful symposium were later published in an anthology edited by Harold E. Briggs and Rzepnicki Using Evidence In Social Work Practice:Behavioral Perspectives(2004)  published by Lyceum Books  and prepared for publication in a special section of the journal onResearch on Social Work Practice.She was preceded in death by her husband  the distinguished psychologist and behavior analyst  Donald M. Baer. She leaves no immediate survivors. A memorial service is being planned.
                    Bertram Cohler  psychologist and esteemed teacher  1938-2012            ,Update:A memorial service for Bert Cohler will be held at 6 p.m. June 4 in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel.Bertram Cohler  a UChicago psychologist and celebrated teacher who was an expert on family life and transitions  died May 9. Cohler  73  was the William Rainey Harper Professor in the College.Cohler’s primary appointment was in Comparative Human Development  with joint appointments held in Psychology  Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience  and the College. He was a mainstay of the Self  Culture and Society Core sequence  which he co-chaired for many years  and he also previously served as a Resident Head in the housing system.He sustained an interest in clinical psychology throughout his career. He played a major role in the intellectual life of the Chicago psychoanalytic community and trained several generations of clinical PhD students.“Bert Cohler was the embodiment of intellectual seriousness and love of assumption-questioning discourse that typifies the University of Chicago. I have long thought that the color of his blood must be maroon ” said Richard Shweder  the William Claude Reavis Distinguished Service Professor in Comparative Human Development.He twice won the University’s top prize for College teaching  theQuantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching  first in 1975 andagain in 1999.In 2006he won the Norman Maclean Faculty Award from the UChicago Alumni Association for outstanding contributions to teaching and student life on campus.The essence of good teaching begins with respect for students  he said in an interview with theUniversity of ChicagoChroniclein 1999. “I learn a tremendous amount from what the students say in class  and I want them to know I consider that important ” he said.As a professor  he normally taught more classes than were required  as well as evening and summer courses through the University’s Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.“Bert’s love of students and teaching combined with an almost fanatical zeal to do his part in ensuring that the University fulfilled its responsibility to teach. He often said he was merely carrying out the ideals of his beloved University of Chicago  but it is clear  in the end  that Bert himself was a beacon of these ideals ” said Michael Kaufman  a doctoral student in human development.Cohler’s research interests included life-story and response to adversity and stigma. He taught a course  “Sexual Identity and the Life Course of Gay and Lesbian Lives ” which looked at the social contexts of gays and lesbians at various points in their lives  from childhood to old age.The course was inspired by a book Cohler co-authored with Robert Galatzer-Levy  clinical professor of psychiatry at UChicago The Course of Gay and Lesbian Lives: Social and Psychoanalytic Perspectives  published in 2000.“Bert never separated his professional and personal life. His love and respect for people led him to use tools ranging from empirical research to deep examination of his own struggles to explore how individuals  in all sorts of contexts  ‘search after meaning’ across the course of life ” said Galatzer-Levy.“Bert leaves behind not only a massive scholarly accomplishment but also an ideal of compassionate comprehension in the study of human lives ” he added.Cohler was part of the University community much of his life. He attended the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School and University High School and continued his work at the College  where he received an AB in human development in 1961.He received a PhD from Harvard University in 1967 from the department of social relations  where he deepened his interest in psychoanalysis as a means of understanding life course development.“He was an erudite clinical psychologist trained in the interdisciplinary spirit of the Department of Social Relations at Harvard  where anthropologists  sociologists and psychologists were members of the same department ” said Shweder.UChicago’s Department of Comparative Human Development carries on the tradition “in a large measure because of intellectuals such as Bert Cohler ” he added.He came to Chicago in 1969 to become director of the Orthogenic School at the request of its legendary leader Bruno Bettelheim  who was retiring. In Chicago he resumed his psychoanalytic studies  completing psychoanalytic training at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis  where he later became a prominent faculty member.He joined the UChicago faculty in 1972 and was the principal investigator in a continuing study funded by the National Institute on Aging  concerning relations among young adults  their parents and grandparents in a Midwestern community.He was co-editor ofMentally Ill Mothers and Their Children (1975).His work led to a new understanding of the roles between parents and children brought on by aging  which can lead to an imbalance in mothers’ and daughters’ social ties  he pointed out.“The older mother is increasingly preoccupied with the psychological consequences of her own aging at just the time her daughter is expressing the desire for increased contact and additional assistance in performing the roles of housewife and mother ” Cohler wrote inMothers  Grandmothers and Daughters(1981)  a book he co-authored.He continued his publications on lifetime and transitions and was the author and editor of a number of important scholarly works  including theEssential Other  which he co-wrote with Galatzer-Levy (1993). He was a co-editor of theHandbook of Clinical Research and Practice  also published in 1993.After his wife  Ann  died in 1989  Cohler entered a new phase in his life as a gay man. His research moved to include issues of homosexual identity  and he wrote a number of articles on the issues confronting young gay people as well as aging gays.Cohler put into practice what he studied and took leadership roles in fighting homophobia on campus and bringing psychological care to underserved populations. He held several leadership roles including the Presidency of the American Orthopsychiatric Association. Throughout his life he remained an active clinician  often working with troubled adolescents.In his final years he also worked extensively studying the life narratives of Holocaust survivors.He is survived by sons  Jonathan and James; granddaughters  Emma and Kate; grandson  Logan; and his partner  Bill Hensley.A memorial service will take place in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on June 4.
                    Larry Sjaastad  scholar of international economics  1934-2012            ,Larry Sjaastad  professor emeritus of economics and a leading expert on trade in Latin America  died May 2. A resident of Hyde Park  he was 77.Sjaastad made fundamental contributions to economics across a wide spectrum of topics including public finance  international economics and exchange rate theory.“Larry’s teaching and the bonds he made with students have had a huge effect in Latin America ” said Jorge Garcia-Garcia  PhD’75  a senior evaluation officer with The World Bank. “His students now occupy important positions in government and academia  and as a result  his ideas have had a larger effect in those countries ”“A good example of the influence of his research was Larry’s famous ‘shift coefficient ’ the share of import protection born by the country’s own exporters ” said Kenneth Clements  PhD’77  professor of economics at the University of Western Australia. “This explained clearly why countries that tax imports tend to have languishing export sectors. Exporters in Latin America and Australia in the 1980s were quick to realize the significance of this research for them.”Sjaastad helped organize the Latin American Workshops at the University of Chicago. As a young scholar he developed an interest in Latin America when he directed a training program started in 1962 for Argentinian students in economics that was organized at the Universidad National de Cuyo as a joint program with professors from the University of Chicago. It was the first such program established through President John F. Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress  which was intended to improve relations with Latin America.He also was a visiting professor at universities in Chile  Colombia  Singapore  Western Australia and Brazil.Sjaastad was born on a farm near Tagus  N.D. and enrolled in the North Dakota Agricultural College to study electrical engineering. He received a scholarship to attend UChicago  where he developed a passion for analytical  applied economics.His publications in economics were significant from the beginning. After receiving his undergraduate degree in 1957  he continued as a graduate student in economics and received a PhD from UChicago in 1961. His doctoral thesis  a path-breaking extension of human capital theory into the study of migration decisions  was developed into an influential article  “The Costs and Returns of Human Migration ” which remains widely cited today.The paper  published in theJournal of Political Economy  examined migration patterns in the United States in a comprehensive way. It sought to determine the social and personal costs of migration  in monetary and non-monetary terms  such as moving from to another state because of better living conditions.The thesis also became legendary for students in UChicago’s Department of Economics.“Larry's thesis on migration was held up by (former UChicago professor) Gregg Lewis and other teachers as a model dissertation for my class. It was a standard that few of us met ” said Nobel Prize winner Robert Lucas  the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor in Economics at UChicago  who received a PhD from UChicago in 1964.After briefly teaching at the University of Minnesota  Sjaastad in 1962 joined the UChicago faculty  where he remained until his retirement in 2004.During his 42-year teaching career  Sjaastad supervised 139 doctoral dissertations and was a vital source of guidance and support for countless students. Known for his ability to present complex economic theory in a clear  accessible manner  Sjaastad set an example for excellence in teaching  former students said.“He had a special gift of being able to understand people well and being able to help them  especially international students studying economics in the challenging intellectual environment that Chicago is so well known for ” Clements said In 2008  he receivedNorman Maclean Faculty Award  given by the University’s Alumni Association in recognition of his outstanding teaching.When Sjaastad retired  he was presented with a work titled  “The Larry Sjaastad Letters ” which included expressions of gratitude and well wishes from former students  colleagues and friends. One former student eloquently summed up Sjaastad’s impact by urging him to “stick around because we are used to counting on you.”He is survived by his wife  Irene Glasner; and sons  Michael and John Sjaastad.
                    Emmet Larkin  prominent scholar of Irish history  1927-2012            ,Update:A memorial service for Emmet Larkin will be held at 3 p.m. May 30 in Bond Chapel. A reception will follow in the Swift Hall Commons Room.Emmet Larkin  a University of Chicago history professor and one of the nation’s leading scholars of Irish history  died March 19 at the age of 84.Scholars in both the United States and Ireland credit Larkin with bringing important insights into the importance of the Catholic Church in Ireland after the devastation brought on by the potato famine. He pointed out that the period became a time of increased devotion to the church.Larkin began his career as a scholar of Irish history by doing research in Dublin as a graduate student. His initial work on a labor leader in Ireland  James Larkin (to whom he was not related)  led to his first book in 1965:James Larkin  Irish Labour Leader  1876-1947.He then studied the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland  publishing a series of seven volumes on the political history of the church from 1850 to 1891. The first volume The Roman Catholic Church and the Creation of the Modern Irish State  1878-1888  won the American Catholic Historical Association’sJohn Gilmary Shea Prizefor the best book of the year in Catholic history.His most widely read book The Historical Dimensions of Irish Catholicism  was a collection of three essays he had published in theAmerican Historical Review. The most influential of these essays introduced the concept of a “devotional revolution” to describe the post-famine process  which Larkin argued led to a much higher percentage of the Catholic population in Ireland to comply with the canonical requirements for religious practice than any other part of Europe (with the possible exception of Poland) until the late-20th century.The book also pointed out that after the potato famine  the church became important to the impoverished rural economy of the country by bringing educational services and building projects  which provided employment.“His concept of ‘the devotional revolution’ has become a key analytical tool for the wider understanding of politics  religion and society in post-famine Ireland ” said Mary Daly  professor of modern Irish history in the School of History and Archives at University College Dublin.“Irish-based scholars are permanently in his debt for highlighting the riches of the archival holdings of the Catholic Church in Ireland many decades ago; if he had failed to do so  it is possible that many of these collections might not have survived ” she added.In 2006  the year of his retirement  Larkin published his last book The Pastoral Role of the Roman Catholic Church in Pre-Famine Ireland  1750-1850. He was continuing work on another book  entitledThe Devotional Revolution in Ireland 1850-1880 prior to his final illness.Larkin did extensive archival work in Britain  Ireland and Rome for his publications and is remembered for his objectivity in studying the influence of the Catholic Church in Ireland.“He never shied away from exposing the frailties of many bishops and priests  and their frequent displays of authoritarianism  bigotry  narrow vision and Puritanism  but he concluded that the general effect of Irish Catholicism has been more positive than negative ” said Lawrence J. McCaffrey  professor of history at Loyola University of Chicago.Larkin found that the church “provided an impoverished and oppressed people with consolation  hope  discipline  and cultural and national identity. It also has offered them social  medical and educational services when the state was indifferent to their poverty and ignorance ” McCaffrey said.“His analysis relied on an intense study of correspondence among ecclesiastics in Ireland and in Rome  as well as politicians in both Ireland and Britain ” said David Miller  professor of history at Carnegie Mellon University and a former student. “Perhaps the most compelling outcome of his research is his argument that in 1884 the hierarchy came to terms with Irish nationalism in what he describes as an ‘informal concordat.’ This finding opened a new way of understanding church-state relationships a generation later in a new nation-state.”Miller also described Larkin as having “the ideal attributes for an adviser of a graduate student seeking a career in the academic world: He was both demanding and supportive.”In 1960  Larkin and McCaffrey helped found the American Committee for Irish Studies  to bring together scholars on the history and literature of Ireland.Larkin was honored in Ireland as well as the U.S. for his work. He received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland in 1987 and numerous fellowships  including a Fulbright Award to study at the London School of Economics from 1955-56  and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship.His publications received awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities  the Council on National Literatures  the American Irish Foundation and the American Ireland Fund.Born May 19  1927  Larkin grew up in an Irish American family in New York. His father grew up in Galway and was a fighter for Irish independence. Larkin was a corporal in the U.S. Army from 1945-46.Larkin received a BA from New York University in 1950 and a PhD from Columbia University in 1957. He taught at Brooklyn College and became an assistant professor in 1960 at MIT. He was appointed to the faculty at UChicago in 1966 and retired in 2006.Survivors include his wife  Dianne; daughters  Heather Larkin and Siobhan Kates; and granddaughters  Alexis and Erin Kates. A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. May 30 in Bond Chapel on the UChicago campus.
                    Peter Novick  celebrated scholar of history  1934-2012            ,Peter Novick  a University of Chicago historian whose specialty was the study of history itself  or historiography  died Feb. 17 at the age of 77. Novick  professor emeritus of history  used his formidable skills to explain how different views of the past can shape the retelling of history and establish narratives that have a power of their own.Early success suggests Novick might have had a career as an historian of 20th-century France. His Columbia University doctoral thesis  awarded the Clark M. Ansley Award  was published in 1968 asThe Resistance Versus Vichy: The Purge of Collaborators in Liberated France. In response to a vigorous national debate about the role of Vichy in wartime France  the book was translated and published in 1985 asL’Epuration Française 1944-1949  a popular “Le Grand Livre du Mois” book club selection.But Novick’s interest in how the past is talked  thought and written about led to the two landmark books that followed:That Noble Dream: The ‘Objectivity Question’ and the American Historical Profession(1988) andThe Holocaust in American Life(1999).“ThatNoble Dreamdissected and deflated the ‘myth ’ as Peter called it  of scientific objectivity that had legitimated the institutionalization of history in the American university from the late 19th century on ” said his colleague Jan Goldstein  the Norman and Edna Freehling Professor in History at UChicago.“The Holocaust in American Lifedeveloped the even more iconoclastic thesis that a segment of American Jewry had enlisted the Holocaust remembrance as a way of preventing their thoroughgoing assimilation into the American mainstream ” Goldstein said.“What is remarkable about these two books is that in them  Peter trained his powerful intellect on two salient aspects of his own identity: his professional identity as a historian and his cultural identity as a secular American Jew ” Goldstein said.“While Peter had chosen these topics for intensely personal reasons  his personal involvement never compromised the rigor of his research and analysis. That he was deeply ambivalent about both academic history and Jewishness only raised the stakes ” Goldstein said. “Written in a crystalline prose that appears effortless  the books are stunning works of history cum cultural commentary and  from the vantage point of their author  acts of moral courage.”That Noble Dreamwon the American Historical Association’s 1989 Albert J. Beveridge Prize for best book of the year in American history.The book fueled a hot debate at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association  as theChronicle of Higher Educationreported in January 1991. “We should disregard far-reaching claims to objectivity ” theChroniclequoted Novick speaking to his colleagues. “We don’t have to be definitive; we can just be interesting or suggestive.” The text of the entire panel was published in theAmerican Historical Reviewof June 1991.Despite the controversy  Novick’s colleagues recognized the enduring value of his contribution. As Linda Gordon  one of the panelists at the AHA session attested  “We are all in Peter Novick’s debt for this book. It is a gift to historians and other scholars  present and future.”ThoughThe Holocaust in American Lifewas the subject of much controversy  the book also brought much praise  including the Phi Beta Kappa Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for outstanding studies of the intellectual and cultural condition of mankind.The award citation noted: “Novick’s work shows that historians choose their subjects and frame their evaluations and explanations in ways heavily shaped by their ideologies and the institutions in which they work. This is an exceptional historical essay––a work in which the author has used all the resources of his craft to clarify public thinking on a deeply problematic and sensitive issue.”In a faculty report on the project  Novick wrote the Holocaust had become a “symbol and a memory in the public mind  both ‘the public’ in general and particular publics. I am concerned with strategies for ‘mastering the past’ with respect to the Holocaust  which naturally differ for different groups and sub-groups  and how the treatment of the Holocaust served various other social and ideological purposes ” he wrote. “I am equally concerned with the extent to which the Holocaust experience has become  for many Jews  the central symbol of Jewish identity.”The book caused immediate controversy as reviewers  and some Jewish leaders criticized it for not recognizing the enormity and unprecedented nature of the Holocaust. Among his iconoclastic observations  Novick rejected the popular “lessons of the Holocaust ” claiming the Holocaust a bad source of lessons because of its extremity.“Novick’s sensible if unpopular conclusion that we should study a historical event like the Holocaust  not to extract lessons but to its complexities and contradictions  will please a few readers but probably upset many more ” wrote Lawrence L. Langer  an author on the Holocaust  inThe New York Times.Writing inThe New York Review of Booksin March 2000  Eva Hoffman was more in tune with the spirit of the book and with Novick’s motivations in writing it.“The Holocaust in American Lifehas already been criticized for the harshness and alleged “cynicism” of its tone  and it is indeed a tough-minded work  sharp  brusque  and sometimes nearly Swiftian in its acerbities ” she wrote. “But the anger is a measure of Novick’s involvement; his candor is part of the argument. Novick is clearly intent on cutting through the circumlocutions of habitual Holocaust discourse  on challenging what he sees as its obfuscations with uncompromising logic and saying out loud what is often intimated in private.”Reprinted in Great Britain asThe Holocaust and Collective Memory(2009)  the book also has been translated into French  German  Spanish and Chinese.Beginning his academic career as assistant professor at the University of California  Santa Barbara in 1965  Novick joined the UChicago faculty in 1966. He served terms as assistant visiting professor at Northwestern University and Pennsylvania State University in the 1960s  though UChicago remained his home institution until his retirement in 1999.He served as president of the UChicago chapter of the American Association of University Professors and as a member of the Council of the University Senate.Born July 26  1934 in Jersey City  N.J. to Michael and Esther Novick  Peter Novick served in the U.S. Army from 1953-55. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1957 and his doctorate in 1965  both from Columbia University. He is survived by his wife  Joan (née Kroll) and his son  Michael.A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. May 22 in Bond Chapel  with a reception to follow in the Swift Common Room.
                    Jean Allard  first female vice president at UChicago  1924-2012            ,Jean Allard  the first female vice president at the University of Chicago and a longtime Hyde Park resident  died Sunday  Jan. 29  at the Buckingham Pavilion nursing and rehabilitation center in Chicago  following a long illness. She was 87.Allard  JD’53  who served as Vice President for Business and Finance from 1972-76  was known for breaking gender barriers at the University  in the legal profession and in the business world. She also held a strong commitment to mentoring other women and providing civic leadership.“She always moved by example ” said Judy Barnes  MBA’78  executive assistant to Allard during her role as VP for Business and Finance. Barnes refers to Allard as her first mentor and a lifelong friend. “You could always learn by just watching and listening to her. She really helped me understand how to effectively manage  as a female in a male-dominated environment  to get things done in a very elegant fashion without a lot of fanfare.”Strong UChicago FoundationsBorn Marion Jean McGuire in Trenton  Mo.  in 1924  Allard first came to UChicago as a psychology doctoral student after earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Culver-Stockton College and Washington University in St. Louis  respectively.After taking a class at the Law School  she switched her focus of study — and excelled in her new field. Allard served as managing editor of theUniversity of Chicago Law Reviewand won the American Bar Association’s national student moot court competition for best brief and second best oral argument.One of only two female graduates in the class of 1953  Allard had trouble finding a law firm that would hire a woman  according to her niece  Patricia John  AB’81  MBA’89. She became a research associate to the husband-wife Law School team of Karl Llewellyn and Soia Mentschikoff. Mentschikoff  a pioneering female legal scholar  became an important mentor to Allard. Within three years  Allard became an assistant dean under Edward H. Levi.Leaving UChicago in 1958  Allard worked as an antitrust lawyer for several years before becoming general counsel and secretary at Maremont Corporation  an auto parts company. After 10 years  Allard returned to UChicago at the request of Levi—by then president of the University—to be his VP for Business and Finance.“She always understood and loved the University of Chicago but also understood there were areas that needed to change and move forward ” said Barnes  calling Allard’s intelligence “inimitable.”In her role  Allard worked on everything from creating the University’s first patent policy and revamping its leasing policy  to overseeing the comptroller’s office and beautifying the Quadrangles.In fact  in 1976 at her farewell party  Allard’s business and finance staff made a lighthearted nod to her many responsibilities  presenting her with one of the trashcans she had been tasked with selecting for the Quads.Breaking Glass CeilingsAllard’s son  John Allard  fondly remembers her love of their Colorado summer home and skiing out west  passions she passed on to him.“My mom would drink her coffee on a big boulder where us little kids couldn’t get up there to bug her. She would relish that time.”While family and friends reminisce about her love of cooking  flower arranging and entertaining—including throwing herself birthday parties in places like Paris and the Adler Planetarium—Allard is best known for the gender barriers she shattered in the legal and business worlds.In 1984  she told theHyde Park Heraldof her drive: “If you are not in over your head  then you are not really productive."In 1976  Allard left UChicago to become the first female partner at Sonnenschein Carlin Nath & Rosenthal (now SNR Denton). She stayed until 1991  when she became president of Chicago’s Metropolitan Planning Council  although she remained ‘of counsel’ at Sonnenschein.While at Sonnenschein  Allard mentored Valerie Jarrett  now a senior adviser to President Obama. Jarrett  formerly the Vice-Chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of Chicago and Chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of Chicago Medicine  described Allard’s approach to theChicago Tribunefor Allard’s obituary. “Not only is she a role model for her extraordinary accomplishments ” Jarrett said of Allard  “but she’s a role model for how to treat people when you’ve reached the pinnacle of success.”Allard continuously faced her pioneer status with grace and humor  according to niece Patricia John. When she became partner at Sonnenschein  Allard felt a duty to play golf with her male colleagues who had canceled their membership at a male-only golf club and switched to a different club that admitted women. At another time  as one of the first women members of the Commercial Club of Chicago (along withHanna Holborn Gray the first female president of UChicago)  Allard’s niece accompanied her to the club’s annual father-son Christmas party  at which they were the only two women in attendance.“She was always proud when she cut through barriers like that  but she never let it tear at her. She didn’t like it  but she dealt with it ” said John. “I used to think she ate glass for breakfast.”Service to the CityIn 1979  Allard helped found the Chicago Network  an organization of Chicago’s most respected professional women. She also was the first female board member at Commonwealth Edison (now Exelon) and Marshall Field & Company. In addition  Allard sat on the boards of LaSalle National Bank  AM International and USF&G Corporation.“I volunteered for work a lot  which I think is one of the ways you become a more important person in any institution ” she toldToday’s Chicago Womanin 1988  when it named her its Woman of the Year. In 1987  theChicago Tribuneselected her as one of Chicago’s 10 most powerful women.“I’m not afraid of standing up to change things ” she told theTribunein 1987.Among many other civic leadership roles  Allard continued to be active at the University through the Law School Alumni Association  the Harris School Visiting Committee  the GSB Council and the advisory board to the Women’s Business Group.“My mom reached many summits in her life ” said John Allard  her son with first husband Robert Allard  DB’50  JD’58.Her son John and a granddaughter survive Allard. Her second husband  David Gooder  preceded her in death in 2006.A memorial is being planned.
                    Paul Gitlin  beloved teacher of social work  1926-2012            ,Paul Gitlin  a beloved teacher and associate professor emeritus at theUniversity of Chicago School of Social Service Administration  died Jan. 23. He was 85.Gitlin’s early experiences as a social worker helping school-age children informed his later work as an educator. He helped build SSA’s group work program along with Profs. Irving Spergel and Mary Lou Somers. The group work sequence  initiated in 1958-59 and directed by Somers  was an important bridge between high-level policy and on-the-ground casework.Gitlin helped to establish the Families  Individuals  and Communities (FIGS) sequence of classes for second-year master’s students and taught many sections of foundational clinical social work classes. He imparted to his students his love for working with and helping children who suffered from emotional and behavioral problems.“Paul Gitlin was a true social worker. His concern for vulnerable children was unparalleled. He cared deeply about ways in which theory could inform practice to enhance the well-being of children and their families ” said Karen Teigiser  former senior lecturer and deputy dean for the curriculum.She added that “relationships were at the heart of his life and work. His connection to his students modeled the essence of social work practice. He invited them to develop self-awareness and honesty in their work.His warmth and genuineness were deeply affirming to his students  clients  colleagues and staff.”Gitlin’s students were equally devoted  and many implemented his wisdom into their careers. Several former students who he inspired  guided and influenced remember Gitlin fondly:“SSA taught me to always view the big picture  and I believe that my success with people comes from my ability to see the problem as a whole and not just in pieces ” said Rory Gilbert  AM’79. “I owe a lot to SSA and professors such as Paul Gitlin.”“Paul did more than impart knowledge about how to effectively intervene to help families and individuals ” said Charles Curie  AM’79. “He challenged me to consider what I brought to the problem solving process and consider how to utilize my experiences in conjunction with the evidence of what works. He became a true mentor and friend to each of us  helping us to be more effective through being genuine. It was a great gift.”“What I appreciated most about Paul during our 36-year relationship was his unwavering commitment to honesty and forthrightness. Paul was resolute about truthfulness and candor  and these are vitally important qualities in social work — indeed  in life. Paul gave meaning to the word integrity and modeled it for generations of students ” said Frederic G. Reamer  AM’75  PhD’78  now a professor in the School of Social Work at Rhode Island College.Gitlin attended Case Western Reserve University  where he received his masters of science in 1954 and doctorate of social work in 1968. He started as an assistant professor at SSA in 1964.Gitlin retired from SSA in 1992. He was preceded in death by his wife Dorianne  and is survived by his three children: Naomi (David Saltz)  Ruth  and Lew (Laura) and his two grandchildren  Todd and Justin. Services were held.

He also served as a senior staff economist on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Advisers.“As dean  George left a lasting impact on Chicago Booth. As a statesman  he brought Chicago thinking and the school’s distinctive values into policymaking ” said Madhav Rajan  dean of Chicago Booth and the George Pratt Shultz Professor of Accounting. “His illustrious career in government  academia and business was an inspiration. We are grateful for George’s service and deeply saddened by his loss.”Born Dec. 13  1920  and raised in Englewood  New Jersey  Shultz joined the UChicago faculty in 1957 after beginning his career as a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.AtChicago Booth  he made significant contributions as a professor of industrial relations and later as dean. During his time at UChicago  he also befriended Nobel Prize-winning economists Milton Friedman and George Stigler.“It’s the most intense intellectual turmoil anywhere ” Shultz said of UChicagoin a 2015 interview. “It’s high-power discussion everywhere  and people challenge you on everything. It’s really exciting.”One of his most significant accomplishments at Chicago Booth was establishing the first scholarship for Black students at a major business school.

The fund invests in promising scientific and technology startups from an ecosystem that includes the University of Chicago  Argonne National Laboratory  Fermilab and the Marine Biological Laboratory.“As one of the most influential policymakers  serving three U.S. presidents  George continually devised creative and thoughtful solutions to challenges big and small ” said Starr Marcello  deputy dean of MBA programs and former director of the Polsky Center. “This spirit of ingenuity is precisely why the Innovation Fund at the University bears his name.”The decision to rename the fund was the result of a $10 million gift from University Trustee Mary A. Tolan  MBA’92  who wanted to honor her longtime friend. Shultz served as an advisor or board member for each of Tolan’s companies in addition to mentoring her  creating many learning opportunities over the years.To date  the George Shultz Innovation Fund has invested $7.8 million in 61 companies that have gone on to raise $210 million in follow-on funding.

The George Shultz Innovation Fund was created to pay tribute to him and his desire to see innovation and entrepreneurial startups from the University of Chicago grow and thrive. His legacy will live on in the startups that have been supported by the George Shultz Innovation Fund.”Shultz earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Princeton University in 1942 and a Ph.D. in industrial economics from MIT in 1949. During this time  he also served in the U.S. Marine Corps for three years  first as an artillery officer and later as a captain.He began his distinguished political career in 1955  when he took a leave of absence from the MIT faculty to join Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Advisers.

In this position  he applied academic theory to successfully resolve the Longshoremen’s Union strike and helped combat discriminatory hiring practices in construction unions. He became the first director of the newly formed Office of Management and Budget in 1970 and was later named Secretary of the Treasury. He was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor  the Presidential Medal of Freedom  in January 1989.In 1974  Shultz took a break from government to work in business  serving as executive vice president and later president of the engineering and services company Bechtel Group.

Philipson and his editors introduced to an American audience works by Jacques Derrida  Paul Ricoeur  Claude Lévi-Strauss and Thomas Bernhard  among others. A translation of essays and letters by the German publisher Kurt Wolff  who as an émigré founded Pantheon Books  was for Philipson “an occasion to make conscious the fact that the character of a press is determined by the publisher making selections on the basis of his conceptions of art and serious thought ” he toldPublishers Weeklyin 1991.In recognition of his extraordinary contributions  the French government in 1984 awarded Philipson the Commandeur de L’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his service to French letters  and in 1982 he became the first director of a scholarly press to win PEN American Center’s Publisher Citation.

As an advocate for the pursuit of “the best that has been said and thought in the world ” he inspired the next generation by teaching courses in philosophy  cultural history and literature at the Julliard School of Music  Hunter College and the University of Chicago. Before returning to his alma mater to assume the directorship  he established his distinctive editorial style at Random House  Alfred A. Knopf and Basic Books during the golden age of New York publishing.His passion for publishing was reflected not only in recognizing the potential in other authors  but in realizing his own literary aspirations.  He was the author of five acclaimed novels —Bourgeois Anonymous(Vanguard  1965) The Wallpaper Fox(Charles Scribner's Sons  1976) A Man in Charge(Simon & Schuster  1979) Secret Understandings(Simon & Schuster  1983) andSomebody Else’s Life(Harper & Row  1987) — as well as short stories and works of nonfiction.Novelist Cynthia Ozick praised his work as comprising “lucid and engaging prose  incisive social insight  high wit  ironic brilliance  narrative urgency  the puzzlement and poetry of human life.”Philipson and his late wife  Susan  shared their love of books and ideas by making their home a salon  where they entertained a diverse spectrum of writers  thinkers and artists  including such luminaries as Hugh Trevor-Roper  Jack Fuller  Wendy Doniger and Bill Russo.He is survived by his children Nicholas  Jenny and Alex  and a granddaughter  Rachel.

We are indeed fortunate to have benefitted from his many contributions and from knowing a man of such exemplary integrity.”Bowman  a senior scholar for the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics and a member of the committees on genetics and on African and African American Studies at the University  was one of the first to study genetic variation among diverse populations  particularly those of African origin  and the relationship between genetics and minority health.Later in his career  Bowman focused on the ethical  legal and public policy issues raised by human genetics and mandatory screening tests in certain U.S. states.“James Bowman’s longstanding commitment to the study of sickle cell disease  both here and abroad  and his advocacy for communities and individuals affected by this mutation stand as the model for discussions of insurability and discrimination on the basis of genetic predisposition ” said William McDade  associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care and deputy provost for research and minority issues at UChicago.Born Feb. 5  1923  James Edward Bowman grew up in Washington  D.C.  during a tumultuous time in U.S. history.“In those days ” he recalled in a 2006 interview for an oral-history project  “there was complete segregation. … One could only go to theaters  movies  restaurants in the black neighborhood.”Still  Bowman said  he managed to get a “wonderful education” at Washington’s all-black Dunbar High School  where many of his teachers had PhDs from leading universities but were unable to secure college-level teaching positions.In 1943  he earned a bachelor of science degree in biology from Howard University. His father  a dentist  urged him to study dentistry  but Bowman wanted to study medicine. He entered Howard Medical School that fall and was immediately drafted into the U.S. Army as part of a specialized program that condensed medical training into three years. Bowman said the Army paid for his medical education with the expectation that all graduates would go directly into the service  but the Department of Defense later decided that they “did not want any black officers.” He was discharged in 1946.He completed his internship at Freedmen’s Hospital in Washington  D.C.  then moved to Chicago for a second internship at Provident Hospital. Soon afterward  an impressed supervisor connected Bowman with an eminent pathologist at Chicago’s St. Luke’s Hospital who offered him a residency position with research opportunities. Bowman accepted  becoming the first African American resident to train at that hospital.During this period  he met Barbara Taylor  the daughter of Robert Taylor  the first African American chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority. They married in 1950  two weeks after she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. Barbara Bowman went on to become president of the Erikson Institute  a graduate program in child development.After his residency  James Bowman served as chairman of pathology at Provident Hospital for three years. He was drafted again and spent 1953 to 1955 as chief of pathology for the Medical Nutrition Laboratory at Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Denver.When his military obligations ended  the Bowmans decided to move overseas. “My wife and I decided that we were not going to go back to anything that smacked of segregation ” he recalled.He was soon offered a job as chairman of pathology at Nemazee Hospital  a new facility in Shiraz  Iran. “We were recently married  so we took a chance ” he said. “It changed our lives completely.”In 1956  a year after moving to Iran  their daughter  Valerie  was born.During their time in Iran  from 1955 to 1961  Bowman said he saw a number of diseases for the first time. “I saw smallpox  brucellosis  rabies  all sorts of things ” he said.One of the most common diseases among certain ethnic groups in Iran was favism  a genetic blood disease caused by an enzyme deficiency. The mutation renders those who have it unable to break down a toxin found in fava beans.Favism fit with Bowman’s lifelong focus on inherited blood diseases and led to a series of important discoveries about the genetics of these diseases and the populations they affect  especially in the Middle East  Africa and America. It enabled him to travel all over the world collecting blood samples for DNA testing. It also led to frequent contacts and collaborations with University of Chicago researchers  who had first described the enzyme deficiency (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency  or G6PD) and its connection with antimalarial medications.“Jim Bowman was one of the early pioneers in the clinical applications of molecular genetics ” said Alvin Tarlov  former chairman of medicine at UChicago. “He did important work on a common enzyme deficiency and on donated blood and was a great source of information for all of us on inherited diseases.”The University of Chicago invited Bowman to join the faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor of medicine and pathology and director of the hospital’s blood bank. “His knowledge of inherited blood disorders enabled him to detect abnormalities in the blood of the donor that  if undetected  would have made the transfusion dangerous to the recipient ” Tarlov said.In 1967  Bowman was promoted to associate professor. In 1971  he became a full professor and director of laboratories. From 1973 to 1984  he directed the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center of the University of Chicago  funded by the National Institutes of Health. Bowman was a member of the national advisory group that urged the Nixon administration to initiate the inception of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center  which served as a model of patient-centered disease management and research. Bowman also served as assistant dean of students for minority affairs for the Pritzker School of Medicine from 1986 to 1990.He gained national attention in 1972 when he declared that the passage of adult mandatory sickle cell screening laws in several states was “more harmful than beneficial.” These laws could “revive many of the past misadventures and racism of eugenics movements ” he argued at the time  adding that adult screening programs create “inaccurate  misleading  politically motivated propaganda which has left mothers frantic.” In 1973  he was named to two federal review committees designed to oversee sickle cell screening and education and to evaluate laboratory diagnostic techniques.“Jim was one of the first scholars to take a deep interest in the ethics of genetic screening  especially for sickle cell disease ” said Mark Siegler  professor of medicine and director of the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at UChicago. “He was anything but dispassionate on this topic. There were lessons to be learned from this early foray into genetic medicine  he insisted  and he served as a tough-minded advocate for the ethical approach to genetic testing of patients and populations.”Bowman published more than 90 research studies in the fields of human genetics and related ethical  legal and public policy issues. He has received many awards  including recognition from the Howard University School of Medicine  the Hastings Center and Stanford’s Kaiser Family Foundation. He also received the CINE Golden Eagle Award for an educational film about sickle cells and the University of Chicago’s Gold Key Award. His legacy at the University of Chicago will continue through the Bowman Society  an advising group that supports minority scholars pursuing academic biomedical careers and sponsors a quarterly lecture series.His impact extended beyond academia and science.“He was my mentor  as he was for so many students ” said Anita Blanchard  associate professor of obstetrics/gynecology at UChicago. “Dr. and Mrs. Bowman made a personal investment in his students’ wellbeing by inviting us into their home and treating us like family. Dr. Bowman inspired us to go beyond our expectations to explore international service and unique learning opportunities.”He is survived by his wife Barbara; their daughter  Valerie Bowman Jarrett  a senior adviser to President Barack Obama  former chairwoman of the University of Chicago Medical Center board of trustees and former vice chairwoman of the University of Chicago board of trustees; and one granddaughter  Laura Jarrett  a lawyer soon to begin practice at Mayer Brown.A memorial service at the University is being planned.
                    Paul Meier  statistician who helped change clinical research  1924-2011            ,University of Chicago professor emeritus Paul Meier  who exerted a major influence on the application of statistics to medical research  died Sunday  Aug. 7 at his home in New York City. He was 87.“Paul was a friend and colleague  as well as one of the most influential statisticians of an important era ” said Stephen Stigler  the Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor in Statistics. “He left an indelible mark on us  and through his research on the world’s clinical analytical practice. He will be missed and cannot be replaced.”[view:story=block_1]Meier was well known among his colleagues for co-developing a statistical method called the Kaplan-Meier estimator  which provided a novel method for estimating survival rates in clinical trial data. It incorporates data from patients who have been followed until death  as well as others who survived. Thejournal articlethat introduced the method in 1958  co-authored by Meier and Edward L. Kaplan  remains one of the most cited research papers in statistics or any other field  with about 34 000 citations to date.Meier also wrote extensively about the polio vaccine trial of 1954. The trial comprised the largest medical experiment in history  involving more than a million children.Meier’s passing has evoked an outpouring of gracious personal and professional testimonials from his friends  colleagues and former students  including Joseph Sonnabend  a leading AIDS researcher now retired in London. “He was a kind of lifeline to me  reassuring me that integrity does exist in a world where principle is so often trampled by ambition ” Sonnabend said of Meier. “He was truly a great man  a unique combination of kindness  honesty and adherence to principle.”Meier also had a profound impact on Theodore Karrison  MS’75  PhD’85  research associate and director of the biostatistics laboratory at UChicago.“Throughout his long career Dr. Meier made outstanding contributions to the application of statistical methods to medical research — contributions that have led to the proper and efficient evaluation of new medical therapies  to the betterment of many patients’ lives ” said Karrison  a longtime collaborator who studied under Meier as a UChicago graduate student.“Paul was the type of person who cared deeply about others and would go out of his way to help people whenever he could — whether it was a student struggling with difficult statistical concepts  an individual coping with an illness  a colleague making a hard career choice or simply someone who needed help with a thorny administrative problem ” Karrisan said. “I’ve always looked up to Paul as an example of how one should strive to be  both professionally and as a human being. I will miss him dearly.”Rima McLeod  professor of ophthalmology & visual science and pediatrics at UChicago  worked closely with Meier for the last two decades on the National Collaborative Chicago-Based Congenital Toxoplasmosis Study. Meier was instrumental in the design  establishment and implementation of the only randomized  clinical trial treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis  a parasitic disease that can result in a wide variety of medical problems.“This study has established that treatment in the first year of life markedly improves outcomes for many of those with this disease  leading to normal  productive lives rather than significant medical problems ” McLeod said. “It changed the face of the disease and improved the lives of many persons with this disease and their families.”Meier was born July 24  1924 in New York City. He received his bachelor’s degree in physics and mathematics from Oberlin College in 1945. He then attended graduate school at Princeton University  where he earned his master’s degree in mathematical logic in 1947 and his doctorate in statistics in 1951.He began his academic career as an assistant professor of mathematics at Lehigh University in 1948-49. He went to Johns Hopkins University in 1952  starting as a research associate in biostatistics before rising to the rank of associate professor. Meier joined the UChicago statistics faculty in 1957  where he remained until 1992. During this period he led the Department of Statistics as chairman or acting chairman for more than 10 years.Meier held joint appointments at UChicago  starting in 1975 as professor of pharmacological and physiological sciences  then in 1985 as professor of medicine. He also held several temporary appointments as a National Institutes of Health Special Fellow at the University of London and Imperial College  as a visiting professor at Harvard University and Jerusalem’s Hebrew University  and as a fellow of Stanford University’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.He retired from UChicago in 1992 as the Ralph and Mary Otis Isham Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Statistics. He then joined the faculty at Columbia University  initially as head of the Division of Biostatistics.A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Royal Statistical Society  and the John Guggenheim Memorial Foundation  Meier received many awards during his career. These honors included election to senior membership in the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.Meier also was named 1986 Statistician of the Year from the Chicago Chapter of the American Statistical Association. More recently  he received the association’s 2004 Samuel Wilks Award “for significant and pioneering contributions to the development of important statistical methods and biostatistical methods.”Additionally  he was a founding member of the Society for Clinical Trials  served on the society’s board of directors  and as its president from 1986-87. He also served on numerous committees of importance to the nation’s health  including the NIH Diet-Heart Feasibility Study Review Committee  a National Academy of Sciences panel on atmospheric pollution  the Advisory Committee of the State of Illinois Institute of Environmental Quality  and multiple Food and Drug Administration advisory committees and clinical trial Data Monitoring Boards.Meier is survived by his wife of 63 years  Louise Goldstone Meier; three children  Diane  Karen and Joan; and five grandchildren.

                    Morgan Buerkett  rising second-year in College  1992-2011            ,Morgan Buerkett  a rising second-year in the College  died Sunday  July 24 in a private plane crash. She was 19.Her parents  Jon and Dana Buerkett  also died in the accident.“She will be painfully missed ” said Susan Art  Dean of Students for the College.Buerkett  also known as “Moe ” was a resident of Woodward House in her first year. She was a member of the volleyball team and belonged to the Delta Gamma sorority.“She was the kid everybody liked immediately ” said Vanessa Walby  head coach of the UChicago volleyball program. “She was very determined and very hopeful.”“If there was anyone who made the most out of every day  it was Morgan ” said Tara Anantharam  Morgan’s freshman roommate.Buerkett  a 2010 graduate of St. Thomas More High School in Champaign  loved watching old movies;The BirdsandSingin’ in the Rainwere among her favorites. She liked the music of Foster the People  Lykke Li and Incubus  horseback riding  and the feeling of breaking in a new pair of tennis shoes.Katie Trela  Buerkett’s volleyball teammate and a sorority sister  said her friend “commanded attention and admiration the second she entered a room.”“She was beautiful and passionate  poised and graceful  confident but modest ” said Trela  a rising third-year. “The greatest tragedy is for the people who will never receive the privilege of knowing her.”A campus memorial service for Buerkett will be planned for early Fall Quarter.
                    William Sumner  director emeritus of the Oriental Institute  1928-2011            ,William M. Sumner  a leading figure in the study of ancient Iran and director of theOriental Institutefrom 1989 to 1997  died July 7 in Columbus  Ohio. Sumner  who oversaw a major expansion of the institute’s building  was 82.Sumner  a resident of Columbus  was a 1952 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He served in the Navy until 1964  rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.He developed his interest in archaeology during naval service in the Mediterranean. Visits to ancient sites in Italy and Greece inspired him to pursue a graduate education. While serving in Iran  he developed a keen interest in the country’s ancient civilization  and he pursued that interest by taking a class taught at Tehran University by Prof. Ezat Ngahban  a graduate of the University of Chicago.He resigned from the Navy to pursue graduate work in anthropology. He received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and was a member of the anthropology faculty at Ohio State University from 1971 until 1989  when he joined the UChicago faculty as professor in the Oriental Institute and Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations.“Bill Sumner was an outstanding archaeologist and a transformational leader at the Oriental Institute ” saidGil Stein  director of the Oriental Institute. “His survey and excavations at the urban center of Malyan in the highlands of Iran made a lasting contribution to our understanding of the Elamite civilization and the deep roots of the Persian empire. He trained an entire generation of archaeologists who went on to become major scholars in their own right in the study of ancient Iran and Anatolia.“As director of the Oriental Institute  Bill Sumner had the vision  the drive and the organizational skills to conceptualize and carry out the building of our new wing  and the complete reinstallation of our permanent museum galleries. Most of all  Bill was a man with tremendous personal integrity  who led by example. His death is a sad loss for our field  and we will miss him very deeply " Stein added.At the Oriental Institute  Sumner encouraged the use of new technologies to expand the work of archaeologists in the field and in the laboratory.“He saw the value  and sensed the impending importance of digital communication and publication  and laid the foundations for the next decade of development along these lines in the OI ” said Gene Gragg  professor emeritus at the Oriental Institute  who succeeded Sumner as director.Sumner recognized the value to archaeology and history of the use of computational technologies and scientific instrumentation. “Bill was a visionary  one of the first who understood the ways that digitalization and computational tools could transform the humanistic and social science disciplines ” saidMartha T. Roth  the Chauncey S. Boucher Distinguished Service Professor of Assyriology in the Oriental Institute and dean of the Humanities Division. “And he was a scholar and person of deep personal and professional integrity.”He also oversaw the initiation of the largest expansion of the Oriental Institute building since it was constructed in 1931. With the help of a federal grant and a $10.1 million campaign  the institute built anew wing to provide space for climate-control equipment  as well as provide space for proper and climate-controlled artifact and archival storage. The new wing also houses a modern artifact conservation laboratory.The Oriental Institute’s museum alsounderwent a massive redesignthat began under his leadership. That led to a rearrangement of the galleries and an updated presentation of the museum’s art and artifacts from throughout the ancient Middle East.Sumner’s own academic specialty was ancient Iran. From 1972 to 1978 he directed the University of Pennsylvania’s excavations at the site of Tal-i Malyan  ancient Anshan  in the Fars province in western Iran. Sumner oversaw the publication of a series of monographs based on five seasons of fieldwork there.The Malyan archaeological project was seminal  not only in discovering the highland Elamite city of Anshan  known locally as Malyan  but also in the cycles of nomadism and sedentism in the region of Fars  that operated in the region from at least the fifth-millennium B.C.  said Abbas Alizadeh  an Oriental Institute archaeologist who specializes on Iran.In addition to his work on the Malyan monograph series  Sumner wrote many articles on the development of civilization in ancient Iran.He is survived by wife  Kathleen Sumner; children  William (Kristin) Sumner  Jane Sumner; step-children  Douglas (Jamie) MacLean and Megan (Savady) Yem; sister  Ida VSW Red; grandchildren  Katrina MacFarland  Eirian Yem  Dylan Yem  Shane Yem  Devon Yem  Lachlan MacLean and Emma MacLean; and great-grandchildren  Nolan and Adeline MacFarland  Anthony Sumner  and Ashley and Colin Sizemore.At his request  there will be no services.
                    Vijay Dayal  head-and-neck surgeon and otolaryngologist  1936-2011            ,Vijay S. Dayal  professor emeritus of surgery and an internationally known authority on the neurophysiology of the auditory and vestibular nerves and on treatment of diseases of hearing and balance  such as Meniere’s disease  died June 30 at age 74.As a physician  Dayal had a reputation for listening intently to his patients  advancing carefully and relentlessly toward a precise diagnosis and performing elegant operations. His colleagues  patients  friends and family consistently describe him as “soft-spoken” and a “gentleman of the old school.” His students  nurses  secretary  even his children insist he never raised his voice at anyone.“He was quite a guy ” said colleague Ernest Mhoon  professor of surgery. “Vijay Dayal was the epitome of the old phrase  ‘a gentleman and a scholar ’ but he was the real thing—always impeccably dressed  knowledgeable and eloquent about seemingly everything  and loaded with British reserve. At the same time his expertise in the field  especially vestibular problems such as dizziness  and his enthusiasm for teaching the residents were obvious.”“He was very quiet  very focused and thoroughly deliberate ” said Elizabeth Blair  a fellow otolaryngologic surgeon at UChicago. “He combined broad clinical experience with a deep knowledge of patient care and the science behind it—something he was always willing to share. It was always a pleasure to work with him.”“He had an enormous impact on my career ” said Jayant Pinto  assistant professor of surgery  who trained in otolaryngology with Dayal. “He was a mentor to all of the residents in our program. He knew everything there was to know about otology and seemingly about every related field in our specialty. He was absolutely devoted to teaching  and he was a wonderful surgeon.”He was also an accomplished inventor. In 1981  Dayal and colleagues in Toronto received U.S. Patent 4274162 for their “artificial replacement for the larynx ” a voice box for people who had lost theirs to trauma or throat cancer. Their replacement larynx “imitates the function of the natural larynx ” according to the patent. It controls the opening and closing of the trachea in the presence of food and permits normal exhalation of air through the patient’s mouth  which enhances voice projection  “a significant improvement over the situation where the patient breathes continuously through a hole in the neck.”At UChicago  he developed and installed a customized rotating chair for diagnosis of dizziness and balance disorders. Patients were securely fastened into the chair and swiveled in either direction  testing the effectiveness of the balance organs throughout a large range of normal motion.“Testing in the chair is not uncomfortable for the patient ” explained Dayal  who had been for several spins himself  at the chair’s unveiling in 1991. “It’s like a mild ride on a merry-go-round  and it provides us with information we cannot get any other way. This often means a more precise diagnosis and better treatment.”Born Sept. 20  1936  in Ranchi  Bihar State  India  Vijay Shanker Dayal showed early academic promise. At the age of 17  he entered Patna University  where he met his future wife  Sheela Sadhu. They both studied at Patna Medical College. He graduated from medical school  at age 22  in 1959  and spent a year as a junior house surgeon in the ear-nose-throat department at Patna Medical College Hospital. In 1960  they moved to the Royal Victoria Hospital at McGill University in Montreal for their residencies  his in otolaryngology and hers in obstetrics and gynecology. They married in 1961.After completing his residency in 1964  Dayal did a three-year fellowship in otolaryngology at the Royal Victoria Hospital. In 1967 he joined the faculty at the University of Toronto as a clinical teacher  and was promoted to assistant professor in 1968  associate professor in 1975 and professor in 1981. He came to the University of Chicago as a professor of surgery in 1986 and stayed on the faculty until assuming emeritus status in 2007. At UChicago he served as director of neuro-otology and as director of the balance and hearing disorders program.Dayal published nearly 80 research papers for scientific journals and was both the author and illustrator ofClinical Otolaryngology  which became the standard text in the field soon after it appeared in 1981. He lectured throughout North America  Europe and Asia and received many honors and awards  including the Campbell Prize in Otolaryngology from the University of Toronto in 1975  the Honor Award from the Canadian Otolaryngological Society in 1987 and the Gold Medal from the Association of Otolaryngologists of India in 1989. The University of Chicago honored him with a symposium in 2006 and its Gold Key award in 2007.He will be remembered by his students for a litany of catchy epigrams that embodied his teaching philosophy. “One favorite ” recalled Pinto  “was ‘the eye cannot see what the mind does not know.’ By that he meant that a clinician needs deep knowledge of disease and hard work studying its diverse manifestations so as to recognize specific signs and symptoms in the patient when they present.”Patients and nurses adored him  Pinto added  and he shared his wisdom in the clinic as easily as in the lecture hall  dispensing diagrams of the anatomy of the ear to explain diseases and their surgical or medical treatment.He combined that deep knowledge with wide-ranging interests. “Every week for the last 10 years  I would seek out a strange case and feed him the details to see if he could figure it out ” said his son Amit Dayal. “I never stumped him. That kind of breadth is not common in the modern era.”In addition to medicine  Dayal was somewhat of an expert on Indian carpets  Indian classical music  photography and gardening  especially growing roses  said his family. “He read constantly—art history  religion—and retained everything ” said his daughter Anji. “He was a renaissance man. He also wore a very nice tie and blazer at all times.”Dayal is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years  Sheela; a son  Amit; two daughters  Aneeta and Anjali; and two grandchildren  Laila and Faye.Private funeral services were held July 1. A prayer and memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. July 11 at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers.
                    James B. Nachman  pediatric cancer specialist  1948-2011            ,Pediatric cancer specialist James B. Nachman  professor of pediatrics—affectionately known as “Doc Nach”—died Friday  June 10 from a suspected heart attack while on a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon. He was 62 years old.An internationally known cancer expert and chairman of several Children’s Oncology Group national study committees  Nachman was an authority in the medical management of childhood cancers—especially leukemia and lymphoma. He helped develop a treatment regimen known as “augmented post-induction therapy” for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and led the clinical trial  published in 1998  that demonstrated a substantial improvement in survival for patients with ALL who had a slow response to initial therapy. These studies helped lead to the high cure rate for this disease today.He also did important work on understanding which patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma were at greatest risk for therapy-related second cancers years later and used that knowledge to adjust the initial therapy for those most at risk. He was a key player among Chicago specialists in the treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcomas  serving as the medical oncologist for the University of Chicago’s limb-salvage program  which worked to save the arms and legs of adolescents with bone cancer.“Jim was an outstanding clinician  teacher and clinical researcher ” said John Cunningham  professor of pediatrics and chief of pediatric oncology. “He made seminal observations in leukemia and lymphoma that have impacted the lives of many children and adults with these diseases. He was an outstanding doctor  beloved by his patients  their families and his colleagues. He was an irreplaceable member of our cancer team. We will miss him deeply.”“He was an incredible chemotherapist  devising novel therapies for patients who did not respond to standard therapies ” said colleague Charles Rubin  associate professor of pediatrics. “Jim was totally devoted to his work. He spent all of his time taking care of patients  teaching students  residents and fellows. He always encouraged the patients to live their lives  and do everything that other kids do. He helped them by obtaining tickets for ballgames  and insisting on them going to school. There was no one quite like him.”“Jim was a remarkable person who cared deeply for his patients  colleagues  students and house staff ” said Kenneth Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division and the Pritzker School of Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs. “He always had a smile and a good word. The world was made better by his presence.”Born Aug. 28  1948 in Chicago  James Burt Nachman grew up in the South Shore neighborhood until the family moved to Highland Park in 1963  when he was in high school.“My father is a pediatrician  and I knew I wanted to be a pediatrician since 4 years of age ” Nachman recalled in a 1989 interview. Since children who need “the most attention and help are oncology patients  I was naturally attracted to that specialty ” he added. “The life and death challenges of oncology appeal to me. I want to make a difference if I possibly can.”He graduatedPhi Beta Kappafrom the University of Illinois in 1970  earned his medical degree from the Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1974  followed by a residency in pediatrics and a fellowship in hematology/oncology at Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He came to UChicago for part of his residency in 1979 and joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1980. He was promoted to associate professor of clinical pediatrics in 1985 and professor in 1999.Nachman was active in the national Children’s Oncology Group  and chaired three international committees on the use of augmented ALL therapy. He was also a founding member of the Ponte de Legno ALL Consortium. A recognized yet accessible leader in his field  he served as a consultant for physicians dealing with difficult cases from around the world.Despite substantial academic commitments  Nachman devoted many hours to his patients’ welfare and progress long after they left his formal care. He established lasting friendships with many of his patients and their families.Outside of medicine  Nachman was known for his enthusiasm for all sports  servingas a basketball coach for the B’nai B’rith Youth Organization and Maccabi Games teams. “He was especially fond of the Chicago White Sox ” recalled Cunningham  “but he followed everything from the National Basketball Association to fourth-division English soccer  as well as Broadway plays  where he was a successful angel investor.”Nachman never married and had no children. He is survived by his father  retired pediatrician Adolph Nachman  of Highland Park  who earned his BS in 1932 and his MD in 1936 from the University of Chicago; his brother  Robert  of Evanston  who received a master’s degree in English from the University in 1973 and is now a partner with Barack  Ferrazzano  Kirschbaum and Nagelberg; and his sister Cathy Nachman  of Highland Park  a teacher and golf coach at Highland Park High School. His mother was the late Rosalind Munk Nachman  also a UChicago graduate.A service of remembrance for family and friends will be held at 2 p.m. Thursday  June 16 at North Shore Congregation Israel  1185 Sheridan Road in Glencoe. A University memorial service will be held at noon on Thursday  July 21 at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel  5850 S. Woodlawn Ave.In lieu of flowers  friends may contribute to the James B.

                    Norman Golb  renowned scholar of medieval Jewish history  1928‒2020            ,Prof. Emeritus Norman Golb  a multilingual scholar renowned for his pioneering research about medieval Jewish history and the Dead Sea Scrolls  died on Dec. 29. He was 92 years old.Remembered by his students as an intellectually generous  kind and patient teacher  the University of Chicago professor of more than 50 years was known for his encyclopedic knowledge—particularly in the study of Qumran  the West Bank archaeological site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. A prolific author  Golb was fluent in Hebrew and Arabic and used his expertise to examine primary sources.“Norman was the master of two demanding fields of study  a proficient multilinguist and a scholarly bloodhound  forever in pursuit of new information ” said Joshua Holo  PhD’00  a former student who is now a dean and an associate professor of Jewish history at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. “He spent countless hours in archives around the world. Norman had a prodigious memory—not just for texts but also for the handwriting of their composers.”The impact of his scholarship extended to his students. Eve Krakowski  PhD’13  credits Golb as an intellectual mentor who taught her “how to conduct scholarly research  examine historical problems and interact with sources.”“Norman asked questions about his sources that no one else thought to ask ” said Krakowski  now an assistant professor in Princeton University’s Department of Near Eastern Studies. “He shifted preconceived notions on their head because he was unbound by scholarly paradigm.”In 1980  Golb published a pioneering thesis that contradicted the established belief that a Jewish sect called the Essenes wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves at Qumran. Instead  he argued that multiple Jewish communities wrote the scrolls in Jerusalem and moved them to Qumran in anticipation of the Roman siege of the city in 70 A.D.“I believe Norm will best be remembered for his work on the Dead Sea Scrolls ” said Christopher Woods  the John A. Wilson Professor of Sumerian and the director of the Oriental Institute at UChicago. “It was a very controversial and radical idea at the time. Norm’s thesis is most synthetically advanced in his 1995 book Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? The Search for the Secret of Qumran. His work intensified the debate over the origins of the Dead Sea Scrolls  which continues today.”Golb’s wide-ranging discoveries included the identification of Obadiah the Proselyte as the author of the oldest Hebrew musical manuscript in the 12th century; the first documentary proof that the Khazars converted to Judaism; and the various manuscripts pertaining to theJews of medieval Normandy. First published in 1976 in Hebrew  his acclaimed bookToledot hayehudim be’ir Rouen bimé habenayim(History and Culture of the Jews of Medieval Rouen) was translated into several languages.Golb’s deep knowledge of the Hebrew and Arabic languages and linguistics  said his son Raphael  allowed him to apply an “exacting methodology” in his scholarship.
                    Alice Chandler  University employee for more than 75 years  1918-2011            ,Update:"Remembering Alice: A Celebration of the Life of Alice Chandler" will be held on Wednesday  June 15  at 4:30pm in the Cloister Club of Ida Noyes Hall  1212 E. 59th St. A reception will follow at 5:30pm  also in the Cloister Club.Alice Chandler  a widely treasured colleague  whose University career of more than 75 years included serving as the office manager for the President and Provost’s offices  died Thursday  May 12 at the age of 93.Chandler  a native of Chicago  began working for the University at the age of 16  after she graduated from high school.“Alice has been a vital part of the President’s office and this institution for generations ” said President Robert J. Zimmer. “Her quiet and unshakeable dedication to the University inspired all who worked with her  and is one of many gifts she has left to us. We will miss her deeply.”In recognition of her dedication  the annual staff service recognition ceremony will be named the Alice W. Chandler Staff Service Recognition Ceremony.“She was very devoted to her work ” said Ingrid Gould  Associate Provost for Faculty and Student Affairs. “She knew how to do everything. There just wasn’t any problem that flummoxed her.”Gould said Chandler routinely arrived at the office by 7am and drove herself to work  even in her later years. She described Chandler as the consummate caretaker  a “mother hen” who cared deeply about solving the problems of people  inside and outside the workplace.“There were people whom she adopted temporarily ” said Gould. “She was there to get your life on track through the way she lived. She was a shining example of how to live well  how to build a community  how to care about people.”Chandler loved to travel and go on cruises with her late husband  her son and her daughter-in-law. Her noontime routine included crossword puzzles  which she would squeeze into the morning if she had a lunch scheduled. She also loved cats and had a soft spot for strays.“People just gravitated to her ” said Gould  who added that Chandler embraced life.“She would say  ‘I have had a wonderful life. I did not wait to live.’ “TheAlice Chandler Staff Service Recognition Ceremony will be held Tuesday   June 14.
                    Patrick Billingsley  probability theorist and actor  1925-2011            ,Patrick Billingsley  an influential probability theorist who also became an accomplished actor of stage and screen  died Friday  April 22 in his Hyde Park home after a short illness. He was 85.“He’s most known for his series of books in advanced probability theory ” said Steve Lalley  UChicago professor in statistics. “They are all models of exposition. They really are fine works of mathematical writing. Several generations of graduate students in both probability and statistics have learned their basic probability from these books. They continue to be used  and they continue to be cited.”Billingsley  professor emeritus in statistics and mathematics  first took the stage in fifth grade  when he played Robin Hood  according to a 1970 article published in theChicago Maroon. He later performed in “The Revels ” the annual faculty review.He began acting in earnest in 1966 at the University’s Court Theatre  back when the professional company was an amateur company staging open-air plays in Hutchinson Courtyard.Billingsley held leading roles in more than 20 productions at Court Theatre and Body Politic Theatre in Chicago. His roles included the Captain inWe Bombed in New Haven (1970); Alonzo inThe Tempest(1977); Dysart inEquus  (1980); and Petey inThe Birthday Party(1978 and 1985).A talent scout saw Billingsley perform inThe Loverin 1977  which led to his successful audition for a part in the 1978 Kirk Douglas filmThe Fury. Billingsley never met Douglas  but they appear on screen together during a car chase on Wacker Drive and Van Buren Street in Chicago. Billingsley played a bad guy who ended up dying in a fiery crash.Billingsley went on to appear in seven more films and in nine television shows. His movie roles included playing a biology teacher inMy Bodyguard(1980)  the professor inSomewhere in Time(1980) and the bailiff inThe Untouchables(1987).“When you teach  you perform in front of an audience. That’s much like acting. As a teacher you’re used to being on stage ” Billingsley told theChicago Tribune Magazinein 1978.Family members and friends knew Billingsley as a man with a zest for life  good cheer and a wry sense of humor  said his daughter Marty Billingsley  a teacher at UChicago’s Laboratory Schools. “He was the type of guy who readMadMagazinealong withThe New Yorkerand watched ‘Monty Python’ as well as the PBS ‘NewsHour on TV ” she said.Her father lived a life of both mind and body  she noted. He worked out daily in the Henry Crown Field House on campus for 40 years  served on the athletic board and even helped run the football scoreboard.“A true Renaissance man  he also painted  did woodworking  sung Child Ballads as lullabies to his children — echoes of which have made their way into his daughter Franny Billingsley’s young-adult novels — and readBeowulfin the original Old English ” Marty Billingsley said.Billingsley was born May 3  1925 in Sioux Falls  S.D. He earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1948  then served in the U.S. Navy until 1957. As a Navy officer he lived for a year in Japan  where he earned a black belt in judo.He attended Princeton University for graduate studies and received a master’s degree in 1952 and a doctorate in 1955  both in mathematics. Billingsley worked as a National Science Foundation Fellow in Mathematics at Princeton in 1957-58.Billingsley joined the UChicago faculty as an assistant professor in statistics in 1958  attaining the rank of professor in statistics and mathematics five years later. He served as department chairman from 1980 to 1983 and retired as professor emeritus in 1994.A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics  his honors also include the Mathematical Association of America’s Lester R. Ford award for mathematical exposition.Billingsley was a Fulbright Fellow and visiting professor at the University of Copenhagen  Denmark (1964-65) and a Guggenheim Fellow and visiting professor at the University of Cambridge  England  in 1971-72. He served as editor of theAnnals of Probabilityfrom 1976 to 1979  and as president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1983.He was the author or co-author of five books  includingStatistical Inference for Markov Processes(1961) Ergodic Theory and Information(1965) Convergence of Probability Measures(1968) The Elements of Statistical Inference(1986). HisProbability and Measure(1986) was translated into Polish.He delivered numerous lectures internationally  addressing students and colleagues in England  India  Scotland  Sweden and Italy. In 1970 he gave an invited address at the American Mathematical Society’s annual meetings.Billingsley is survived by his children Franny  Patty  Julie  Marty and Paul  who is an assistant project manager with UChicago’s Facilities Services; and by his companion  Florence Weisblatt. His late wife of nearly 50 years  social activist Ruth Billingsley  died in 2000.The family is planning an event in June to celebrate Billingsley’s life.
                    Charles Montgomery Gray  legal history scholar  1928-2011            ,Charles Montgomery Gray  a leading scholar of legal history and a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago  died Friday  April 22 at the University’s Bernard Mitchell Hospital. He was 82.He was the author of the books Copyhold  Equity and the Common Law;History of the Common Law Hugh Latimer and the Sixteenth Century; andRenaissance and Reformation England. He also had written numerous articles about legal history and Volumes I  II  III and IV ofJurisdiction in Early Modern English Law.He was the husband of Hanna H. Gray  president emeritus of the University  who is the Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor in History Emeritus. The Grays were married in 1954 after meeting in a seminar at Harvard University.Services will be held at 4 p.m. Monday  May 2 at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. To accommodate the services  parking will be prohibited along the north side of 59th Street and the west side of Woodlawn Avenue  immediately adjacent to the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel grounds.“Charles is already sorely missed ” said Neil Harris  the Preston and Sterling Morton Professor Emeritus in History  who further described Gray as “a major presence” in the life of the University as well as “an extraordinary person — learned  individualistic  gracious  cordial and a wonderful friend.”Harris also marveled at the range of Gray’s talents. “In addition to his impressive legal and historical scholarship  he was an accomplished painter  an evocative poet and at home in a number of languages  some of which were learned not long ago. He wore these distinctions with modesty ” Harris said.Kathleen Neils Conzen  the Thomas E. Donnelley Professor in American History  praised Gray as “a wonderfully generous departmental colleague and always a voice of reason and civility in departmental discussions.”“He offered an imaginative range of courses in medieval British history  history of law and history of legal theory ” Conzen said  “but it was his role as ‘Western Civ. Teacher’ that he once described as the persona ‘that has almost become the center of my life.’”Gray was named professor in history in 1978 after serving on the faculty at Yale University from 1974 to 1978 and previously at UChicago from 1960 to 1972. He also served as master of the New Collegiate Division and associate dean of the College.He was a Guggenheim fellow from 1965 to 1966  and he also held fellowships with the American Council of Learned Societies and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He and Mrs. Gray served as co-editors of theJournal of Modern Historyfor five years.In addition to being a distinguished researcher  he was also an outstanding teacher. In 1992  he received the University’s top award for undergraduate teaching  the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award.He taught courses in Western civilization  medieval and early-modern English history  and the history of English and European law  jurisprudence  and political theory.  He also taught courses in “Fundamentals: Issues and Texts ” a program in the College devoted to examination of major Western and non-Western texts.“I enjoy the process of teaching ” Gray said in an interview with theUniversity of Chicago Chronicle. “In teaching you are forced to think about how you’re going to explain something to your students. You have to make something comprehensible to yourself and then explain it to them.“I feel satisfied in teaching when the students and I have looked at a text  come as close to it as we can and discussed it exhaustively ” he added.Students who recommended Gray for the Quantrell honor spoke of his joy in teaching  as well as his ability to explain the issues involved in their classes."He definitely glows from his eternal enjoyment of teaching  and in turn  this inspires his students to learn. I never leave his classes without serious reflection on my own ideas and the ideas that are greater than myself ” one of the students wrote.Gray was born Nov. 23  1928  in Champaign  Ill. He received a BA summa cum laude from Harvard in 1949  was a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows and received his PhD from Harvard in 1956. He was a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1956 to 1960.In addition to his wife  Gray is survived by his sister  Nancy Gray Sherrill of Wichita Falls  Texas  and several nieces and nephews.
                    David Broder  BA’47  MA’51  legendary political columnist  1929-2011            ,Pulitzer Prize-winningWashington PostcolumnistDavid Broder  AB’47  AM’51  was known as the unofficial dean of the Washington press corps for so long that many observers of politics could scarcely imagine the title belonging to anyone else.Broder  who covered national politics for four decades  died Wednesday in a hospice in Arlington  Va. of complications from diabetes  thePostreported. He was 81.Politicians and journalists alike offered tributes to Broder’s career. President Barack Obama said Broder “built a well-deserved reputation as the most respected and incisive political commenter of his generation.” U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said Broder “set a standard of thorough  careful and in-depth reporting on politics and public policy.”[view:story=block_1]Broder’s deep passion for politics took root at the University of Chicago  where he earned his degrees in political science and was an editor of theChicago Maroon.A frequent visitor to campus  he received theAlumni Medalin 2005. He was recognized for mentoring young journalists  many of them fellow UChicago graduates.  Among the peoplewriting in support of his nomination for the medal  one called him “the embodiment of the very best values of the very best journalists: brave  honest  independent  fair ” who sets the “ethical gold standard in journalism.”He was on campus in 2000 for a broadcast ofWashington Week in Review  joining host Gwen Ifill for a broadcast from Mandel Hall. In 2003  he spoke at a Harris School dinner and received a National League Central championship Cubs cap from then-Dean Susan Mayer.He recalled his affection for the Cubs and the College in a column he wrote for thePostin 1987  when he returned for his40th class reunion: “The ballpark has no electronic scoreboards  fancy frills or other distractions to get in the way of the spectator’s experience of the game of baseball. And the Hutchins College  today as then  encourages a direct experience—at whatever level of understanding one can achieve—of the writings of the finest minds of Western civilization.”Broder grew up in south-suburban Chicago Heights and met his  wife Ann C. Broder  AB’48  AM’51  while in the College. Their son Michael also studied at UChicago and received his MBA in 1991.He recalled his experiences at UChicagoin an interviewwith theUniversity of Chicago Magazinein 2003.Although the University had no journalism courses  the College offered solid training for his future career  Broder recalled.“They taught you to read ” he said  “and to think about what you were reading. So much of what we do in journalism is about parsing people’s sentences. ‘Does this make sense?’ ‘Do the conclusions follow from the premises?’ ‘Are the premises realistic or not?’ ‘Is it consistent with what the same person said or wrote a week before?’”His college years also trained Broder in politics  the article pointed out. At theMaroon  where the editor was an elected post  Broder’s future wife Ann was recruited to vote against him. It seemed natural: They had gone on a blind date that went badly. “All he talked about was that he was just getting over the flu ” Ann told the magazine. But working together at theMaroon they discovered “that we had possibility.” She ended up voting for him.Broder went on to have one of the most storied careers in journalism.He was the national political correspondent for thePost  with a twice-weekly column on American political life that was syndicated in more than 300 newspapers around the world.Additionally  millions of television viewers watched Broder’s regular appearances on NBC’sMeet the Pressand CNN’sInside Politics.  Among numerous awards  his work earned the 1973 Pulitzer Prize in journalism for distinguished commentary  and in the years since  he has continued to earn acclaim for his integrity  judiciousness and insight.Before joining theWashington Postin 1966  Broder covered national politics forThe New York Times The Washington StarandCongressional Quarterly. He has reported on every national campaign and convention since 1960  traveling up to 100 000 miles each election year to interview voters and report on the candidates.He formalized his mentoring of young journalist in his teaching role as a professor of political reporting at the University of Maryland.He was also the author of seven acclaimed books  among themBehind the Front Page: A Candid Look at How News Is Made(1981) The System: The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point(1996)  and most recently Democracy Derailed: Initiative Campaigns and the Power of Money(2000).
                    Bruce Winstein  physicist  1943-2011            ,Bruce Winstein  an experimental physicist who studied the afterglow of the universe’s birth  died Feb. 28 after a four-year battle with cancer. He was 67.Winstein  the Samuel K. Allison Distinguished Service Professor in Physics  the Enrico Fermi Institute and the College  was known as a punctilious leader of experiments measuring the aftermath of the big bang in two fundamental fields of physics — particle physics and cosmology.A strong advocate of “blinded” measurements  in which scientists intentionally conceal the final answer while analyzing data to prevent their preconceptions from influencing the result  he imported many practices of particle physics after his mid-career switch into cosmology  the study of the early universe . “Psychologically  it’s better ” Winstein told an interviewer in 2000. “There’s no concern about  ‘Do we agree with our old experiment?’”In 1999  after 25 years of increasingly precise measurements at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory  Winstein and colleagues produced the first definitive evidence of “direct” CP violation — proof that matter and anti-matter  once thought to be mirror opposites  are not perfect twins. The result showed that the direction time flows  from past to future  is part of the fundamental laws of the universe. The size of the finding produced an “audible gasp” from the Fermilab audience  reports said. In accordance with the “blinded” technique  Winstein had not known the results until the days before the announcement.“Bruce had the skill and the passion to measure that quantity to whatever precision necessary ” saidJames Cronin  the University Professor Emeritus in Physics  who won the Nobel Prize in 1980 for the discovery of CP violation. “The experiments took extraordinary sensitivity and attention to detail.”"Bruce was an extraordinary experimentalist who applied what he learned from particle physics directly to the field of cosmology ” saidStephan Meyer  Associate Director of theKavli Institute for Cosmological Physics. “The result was a new experiment using a different approach and different instrumentation — a great thing for difficult and subtle measurements."At a daylong “Brucefest” retirement party hosted by UChicago last month  former students recalled Winstein as an intense experimenter. “I remember  with surprising fondness  your regular 11 p.m. call asking what I’d learned since dinner ” said Ritchie Patterson  the Department Chair of Physics at Cornell University and a doctoral student of Winstein’s in the 1980s.Outside the lab  Winstein was a mischievous presence. He arranged increasingly elaborate and red-herring-filled surprise birthday parties for his wife  Joan  through 32 years of marriage  and loved hiking with his family each year in the Rocky Mountains. Winstein was an avid audiophile  hosting “blinded” comparisons in the 1980s between vinyl records and then-new compact discs.Winstein had a deep interest in film  took silent movies with a hand-cranked  16-millimeter camera  and founded a film series at the California Institute of Technology while a graduate student. He was proud of having met both Stan Laurel – of Laurel and Hardy  whose films he collected – and Michelangelo Antonioni  the Italian modernist director whom Winstein studied intensely.He later taught two courses on Antonioni at UChicago’s undergraduate College  and he lectured on the director’s work at Middlebury College this past fall. “He really appreciated Antonioni’s creativity and his use of the medium ” said Ted Perry  a Middlebury film scholar and Antonioni specialist  and a friend of Winstein’s.In 1999  Winstein won a Guggenheim Fellowship to collaborate with researchers in cosmology at Princeton University. He began to study the cosmic microwave background radiation — the first flash of light produced after the big bang  now an extraordinarily dim afterglow whose patterns show the footprints of events in the early universe.Back at Chicago  Winstein helped found the Kavli Institute  where he served as the first director and brought together an interdisciplinary group of physicists and astronomers. He led theQUIET experiment  an international collaboration in Chile’s Atacama Desert to measure the polarization  or twists  in the background radiation  to learn the effects of gravity waves believed to have rippled through the fabric of space-time almost 14 billion years ago.“He had an uncanny ability to motivate people working with him to get more out of them than anyone expected ” saidEdward Blucher  UChicago’s chairman of the Department of Physics.Bruce Darrell Winstein was born in Los Angeles on Sept. 25  1943. He attended UCLA before earning his doctorate in physics at California Institute of Technology in 1970.Winstein was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 and to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2007. The American Physical Society awarded Winstein and two others the 2007 Panofsky Prize for outstanding achievements in experimental particle physics. In 1976  he gave the inaugural Arthur Holly Compton Lectures  a public lecture series at UChicago. He served on the faculty at Stanford University in 1986.Winstein is survived by wife Joan  his children Keith and Allison  and his sister Carolee.A memorial service is planned for the spring.

                    Melvin Griem  radiation therapy pioneer  1925–2011            ,A leader in the early days of radiation therapy for cancer  Melvin L. Griem  professor emeritus in radiation and cellular oncology  died of pneumonia Feb. 7 at The Grove at Lincoln Park in Chicago. He was 85.Griem was a pioneer who helped to establish radiation oncology—the use of radiation to treat cancer—as a separate field from radiology  which focused on diagnostic imaging. He was among the first to work with heavy particle emitters instead of X–rays  and he helped create the neutron therapy unit at the University of Chicago in the 1970s. He performed important studies on the long–term consequences of radiation exposure in a therapeutic setting.He was a member of a small group of Chicago radiologists who successfully lobbied for a separate journal  specialty board and professional society for the emerging field  which culminated in formation of theAmerican Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology.Griem combined “a background in physics  a medical education  a concern for patients with cancer  broad vision  unbridled enthusiasm and energy ” said Harold Sutton  professor emeritus of radiation oncology  who came to UChicago as a surgical resident but was converted to radiation oncology by Griem’s enthusiasm for the field. “He was a special man who met the multiple opportunities and challenges of a rapidly evolving specialty with great creative energy and vision.”“He was a visionary  ahead of his time ” said Ralph Weichselbaum  the D.K. Ludwig Professor and chair of radiation and cellular oncology.“He was charming and truly imaginative  a clinician who was genuinely interested in research ” said Leslie DeGroot  professor emeritus of medicine. “He had different ideas from most people  but some of his ideas were extremely good.”“Mel Griem was a hard–working  reliable  honest person who could be depended upon and always ready to be helpful ” recalled Alvin Tarlov  former professor and chairman of medicine. “I respected him greatly as a clinician.”An innovator in radiation therapyIn the late 1950s  Griem and colleagues studied how various drugs or hormones could enhance the effects of radiation therapy for certain types of cancer. In the 1960s  he performed clinical studies of interstitial radiation therapy  implanting radioactive chromium “seeds” into cancerous tissue to deliver high doses to tumor cells but reduce the damage to nearby health cells. This approach produced “favorable” responses and a few lasting successes. A similar technique is now widely used for treatment of prostate cancer.In 1975  he helped launch a neutron–therapy unit for cancer treatment at UChicago  one of the first four such facilities in the United States and  at the time  the only one based at a hospital. He also was known internationally for innovative treatments such as total skin irradiation for mycosis fungoides  a form of lymphoma that produces tumors of the skin.Griem also studied the long–term consequences of therapeutic radiation. In a 1994 study—a marvel of after–the–fact detective work—he showed that gastric irradiation  used from the 1930s to the 1960s to decrease stomach acid in patients with recurrent stomach ulcers  could increase the risk of death from cancers of the stomach  lung and pancreas decades after therapy.Engineer turns to researcher and mentorBorn May 22  1925 in Milwaukee  Melvin Luther Griem was destined  his colleagues recall  for a life that included engineering. As a teenager  he and some friends designed and built a diving suit  complete with an air pump. These mechanical and engineering skills helped him gain a leadership role in an emerging field  where science was often far ahead of technology  and those interested in testing new approaches had to build their own equipment.“He was an engineer at heart; he could fix electronics or replace the engine in his Mercedes ” recalled his son–in–law  Anthony Montag  professor of pathology. “When he was unable to get parts for his microwave oven  he machine–tooled a new part and reassembled the oven. It worked perfectly  but he was incapable of using it to heat up leftovers.”Griem joined the United States Army in May 1943  having just turned 18  and served as a radio repairman until the end of World War II  in August 1945. He returned to college  earning his BS in electrical engineering in 1948  MS in physics in 1950 and MD in 1953  all from the University of Wisconsin.In medical school he met fellow student Sylvia Fudzinski  also of Milwaukee. “I couldn’t read my notes ” he often joked  but he could read hers  “so I married her.”After graduation  they spent a year as interns at the University of Kansas. Both came to the University of Chicago in 1954 to complete their residencies  hers in dermatology and his in radiology. He joined the faculty as an instructor in radiology in 1957  was appointed assistant professor in July 1958 and associate professor in 1961. In 1966 he became a professor and section chief of radiation therapy. That same year he was named director of the Chicago Tumor Institute  a group that pulled together radiation treatment resources from the University of Chicago  the University of Illinois at Chicago and Michael Reese Hospital.A prolific researcher and author of academic papers  Griem also trained dozens of radiation oncologists  including many academicians and chairmen  and was a 2010 recipient of the Paul C. Hodges Alumni Excellence Award given by UChicago’s Department of Radiology.He was also a serious collector of model trains and a member of the Jackson Park Yacht Club  where he served as “fleet surgeon.”Griem is survived by his three children: Katherine Griem  Robert Griem and Melanie Griem; three grandchildren  Hugh  William and Caroline Montag; and his sister Margaret Griem Williamson. His wife Sylvia died in 2010. Two of their children became physicians: Katherine a radiation oncologist  and Melanie a dermatologist.A memorial service is being planned. In lieu of flowers  memorial contributions may be made to theAmerican Cancer Society  Illinois Division  225 N. Michigan Ave.  Suite 1200  Chicago  IL  60601.
                    Miriam Hansen  renowned film scholar  1949-2011            ,Update:A commemorative gathering to honor the life and accomplishments of Miriam Hansen is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Monday  March 14  in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. This University memorial service is open to the entire University community and the public.Film scholar Miriam Hansen  who founded the University’s Cinema and Media Studies program  died Saturday  Feb. 5  after a long battle with cancer. She was 61.Over the course of her career  Hansen  the Ferdinand Schevill Distinguished Service Professor in the Humanities  Cinema and Media Studies  English Language and Literature  and the College  made significant contributions to the study of American silent film and film theory. Her 1991 bookBabel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Filmis considered a landmark work in the study of early cinema.Hansen also was an expert on the film theorists associated with the Frankfurt School  including Theodor Adorno  Walter Benjamin  Alexander Kluge and Siegfried Kracauer. Shortly before her death  she completed a book manuscript on the work of these thinkers  entitledCinema and Experience: Siegfried Kracauer  Walter Benjamin and Theodor W. Adorno  a sustained reflection on the historicity of cinema and the challenges of the present.Film was never far from her mind  said her husband  Michael Geyer  the Samuel N. Harper Professor in History and the College  who first met Hansen at her University of Chicago job talk in 1989. “She was the consummate film theorist and film historian  and that expanded into her private life.”After her arrival at the University of Chicago in 1990  Hansen set out to establish the Committee on Cinema and Media Studies  initially an expansion of the English Department’s film studies offerings. Hansen hoped that the program  which encompassed theory and criticism and ranged across disciplines  would broaden the horizon of students who approach the study of film.“[The Cinema and Media Studies program] was in every sense her creation ” said Tom Gunning  the Edwin A. and Betty L. Bergman Distinguished Service Professor in Art History  Cinema and Media Studies  and the College.“Miriam had the most astonishing energy of anyone I’ve ever encountered ” Gunning added. “She was enormously generous in discussing ideas and insights with colleagues and students. She was a meticulous reader  very demanding and tremendously original in her insights. She was just extraordinary.”“She was someone who kept us honest ” said Yuri Tsivian  the Cinema and Media Studies Department chair  who recalled Hansen’s relentless passion for her work and fierce devotion to the program she founded. “Her work ethic was enormous.”A native of Germany  Hansen was born April 28  1949. She received her doctorate from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt in 1975. Her dissertation on Ezra Pound was honored with the Universität Frankfurt’s Publication Award for Outstanding Dissertation  one of many honors Hansen would receive over the course of her distinguished career. She was a three-time winner of the Katherine Singer Kovacs Essay Prize in Film  TV & Video studies  a 1997-1998 Guggenheim Fellow  and a 2007-2008 fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Berlin.“Miriam worked tirelessly to bring the Film Studies Center and the Cinema and Media Studies program from initial vision to national prominence. It's hard to imagine that anyone else could care as passionately or attend as unremittingly to every detail of building a preeminent program ” said Elizabeth Helsinger  the John Matthews Manly Distinguished Service Professor in English Language and Literature  Art History  and the College. “She also believed very strongly in the obligation to support students in every way: to engage them continuously in an intellectual and social community."Hansen’s support made a lasting impression on Daniel Morgan  PhD’07  a former student who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh. “She taught students how to think  in the most basic and far-reaching ways  about cinema as both an institution and an artistic form ” he said. “The results of her teachings are evident in the work and thought of all those who crossed her path  as is her infectious enthusiasm for the films themselves—an enthusiasm she bequeathed to each group of students she encountered.”Colleagues and friends remember Hansen’s dry wit and her fondness for early film comedians like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. She enjoyed travel  music  talking politics  and discussing art and literature with her husband.“It was a very intellectual family of two ” Geyer said.Hansen is survived by her husband and her brother  Micha Bratu. Services were held Feb. 8 at KAM Isaiah Israel Congregation  1100 E. Hyde Park Blvd. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the Miriam Hansen Fellowship Fund  c/o the Division of the Humanities  1115 E. 58th St.  Chicago  IL 60637.
                    Eugene Goldwasser  biochemist behind blockbuster anemia drug  1922–2010            ,Eugene Goldwasser  the scientist who first purified erythropoietin—the hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells—died from complications related to advanced prostate cancer on Friday  Dec. 17 at his Hyde Park home. He was 88.Generally regarded as the “father of EPO ” a drug that helped launch the biotechnology revolution  Goldwasser was the Alice Hogge and Arthur A. Baer Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He led the team that  after 25 years of concentrated effort  purified the sheep form of erythropoietin  then the human variety. The discovery has enabled millions of dialysis patients and anemic patients with other diseases to live longer and more productive lives.“Gene Goldwasser was such a nice  quiet  unassuming guy  you would never know that he had done something so absolutely monumental ” said colleague Donald Steiner  the A.N. Pritzker Distinguished Service Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. “His work with erythropoietin has had enormous impact. It is one of the great contributions to science or medicine of the 20th century  comparable to the discovery of insulin.”A prolific researcher and author  Goldwasser published more than 150 research studies and 60 book chapters—almost all of them about some aspect of erythropoietin  also known as “epo.” He authored two short books: a biography of his mentor  Leon Jacobson  and a recently completed history of the quest for erythropoietin  which should come out in 2011.“He was someone who took enormous delight in doing science ” said Gary Toback  professor of medicine. “He was also a valued mentor  colleague and friend.”Although unsuccessful in persuading UChicago to patent his discovery—a novel concept at the time—Goldwasser worked as a consultant for the start–up biotechnology company  Amgen  sharing his expertise  methods and some of his purified erythropoietin to help them discover and clone the erythropoietin gene. Amgen patented the production of recombinant erythropoietin in 1987 and secured FDA approval of the drug in 1989 for treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis. Although patent squabbles persisted for two more decades  the market for erythropoietin quickly blossomed to several billion dollars a year.“One percent of one percent of the drug’s annual revenues ” Goldwasser wistfully noted years later  “would have funded my lab quite handsomely.”‘Thought it would be a short diversion’It was a request from Jacobson  who ran the University’s Argonne Cancer Research Hospital after World War II  which triggered Goldwasser’s interest in this hormone  which he initially considered “just a laboratory curiosity.” Jacobson wanted to understand how the blood–forming process recovered after radiation exposure. So in 1955 he asked Goldwasser to isolate and purify the biochemical signal that regulated the growth of new red blood cells.“I thought it would be a short diversion for about six months  and then I’d get back to other research ” Goldwasser recalled.In 1957  by removing various organs from rats and looking for the onset of anemia  he had traced production of the signal to the kidneys  which explained why patients with chronic kidney disease were often anemic and suggested that erythropoietin could be found in urine.By 1971 his lab had purified 6 millionths of an ounce of the hormone from 125 gallons of plasma from anemic sheep. Erythropoietin  he noted in a press statement at the time  “is present  even in enriched sources  in an extremely minute amount.”The breakthrough came in 1973  when Takaji Miyake  a Japanese physician who cared for patients suffering from aplastic anemia  contacted Goldwasser. They agreed to collaborate. While Goldwasser procured funding  Miyake collected 2 550 liters of urine from his patients. On Christmas Day 1975  he arrived in Chicago with his concentrated samples. Within 18 months they had eight precious milligrams of the potent human hormone. “We put it in rats ” recalled Goldwasser  “and it worked like a charm.”Epo goes from trial to industrial productionMost of the existing supply went to a small  unpublished clinical trial  development of an assay to measure hormone levels in the blood  and early attempts to determine the amino–acid composition  a first step toward cloning the gene. In 1977  at the urging of colleagues and the federal agencies that funded his lab—the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health—Goldwasser filled out the patent disclosure form and submitted it to the University.“After submitting the form  I promptly forgot about it ” he wrote years later  “since nothing was ever done about filing for a patent. I believe the rules at the time would have allowed me to file a patent for myself if the agency or the University decided not to—another point to perhaps be rueful about.”Filing for patents “was not generally done at the time ” noted Toback.Fledgling biotech companies  however  recognized the potential of Goldwasser’s discoveries. Several  including Biogen and Applied Molecular Genetics (now Amgen) sought his guidance.“Biogen asked Gene to join their board of epo advisors ” recalled Chicago colleague  Robert Haselkorn  professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics. “Gene looked at the list of others on the board and decided that they were mediocre. Then  Amgen went through the same exercise and asked Gene to be their sole advisor on epo. He accepted  declining the board role but signing on as a consultant.” In 1985  a team from Amgen cloned the gene using two probes derived from amino acid sequence analysis of Goldwasser’s purified human erythropoietin samples. “The rest is history.”By 1986  industrial production was under way. The first reports from clinical studies appeared in late 1986 and 1987  confirming that the drug could correct anemia in patients with kidney failure. By 1996  annual sales in the United States exceeded $1 billion. Amgen subsequently funded a professorship in Goldwasser’s department.“The enormous success of epo still astonishes me ” Goldwasser wrote in a 1996 biographical essay. “It is still gratifying to me to see how effective epo is in correcting the anemia of dialysis patients  and how it spares them repeated transfusions.”Less gratifying was the subsequent recognition  in the late 1990s  that athletes had been injecting the drug to boost their red blood cell counts for a competitive advantage. In 1998  an epo–based doping scandal resulted in expulsion or withdrawal for one–third of the 21 teams in the Tour de France  a development that deeply dismayed Goldwasser.The benefits of his discovery however  far outweighed its potential for abuse. “Recombinant human erythropoietin is arguably the most successful therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology to date ” said a 2009 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine. “Since the initial reports … documented a cure of the anemia of chronic kidney disease with recombinant human erythropoietin  well over a million patients have been treated with it effectively and with minimal drug–related toxicity.”Esteemed career at UChicagoBorn Oct. 14  1922  Goldwasser spent his first decade in Brooklyn  N.Y  before the Depression forced his father to close his small clothing manufacturing business and move to Kansas City  where his brother ran a similar business. In high school  Goldwasser developed an interest in science. He won a scholarship to the University of Chicago  where he majored in biological sciences and  after the attack on Pearl Harbor  worked as a research assistant in the University’s Toxicity Laboratory  a federally funded program to assess chemical and biological risks. He completed his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry in March 1943.He was drafted into the United States Army in 1944 and served for two years as a biochemist at Fort Detrick  Md.  working on anthrax. In 1946  he returned to UChicago as a graduate student. He married Florence Cohen of Chicago in 1949 and completed his PhD in biochemistry in 1950. He spent the next two years in a post–doctoral fellowship studying nucleic acids (part of it alongside fellow post–doc James Watson  a future Nobel laureate) with Herman Kalckar at the Institute for Cytophysiology in Copenhagen  Denmark.In 1952  Goldwasser returned to Chicago as an instructor in biochemistry. He stayed for the rest of his career  rising to professor of biochemistry and molecular biology in 1963 and chair of the department from 1984 to 1985. He retired at age 65 in 1987  but remained active in his laboratory and served again as department chair from 1994 to 1998. He also served as chair of the Committee on Developmental Biology from 1976 to 1991. Goldwasser retired again in 2002.He received several honors  including election as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and  most recently  the 2005 Prince Mahidol Award  from Thailand  given for “outstanding performance and/or research in the field of medicine for the benefit of mankind.”His first wife died in 1981. In 1986  he married Deone Jackman  a Hyde Park neighbor  who was introduced to him by a mutual friend. He is survived by Jackman; three sons: Thomas  of San Francisco; Matthew  of Chicago; and James  of New York; two step children  Tom and Tara Jackman; and seven grandchildren.His friends and children recall him as an avid and gifted photographer  sailor  traveler and  in his younger years  skier. “He loved art  music and the Blackhawks ” recalled James Goldwasser. He particularly liked reading  added Toback  “which may explain why two of his three sons are in the book business.”A memorial service will be held at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on Monday  Jan. 24 at 4 pm.
                    Irving Spergel  leading scholar on gangs  1924-2010            ,Irving Spergel  a professor at the University of Chicago and one of the nation’s leading experts on gangs  died Friday at his home in Chicago. Spergel  86  was the George Herbert Jones Professor Emeritus in the University’sSchool of Social Service Administration.Spergel wrote seven books and wrote  co-authored and edited more than 100 articles  reports  chapters and monographs on street gang intervention  including works on community mobilization and gang problem-solving.His interest in research on gangs began while working with gang youth from 1952 to 1960 as part of the New York City Youth Board  an agency he joined after doing social work in Wilmington  Del. and New York City. “It seemed to me that the typical methods of dealing with gangs weren’t working ” he said. “Social organizations were pulling out of helping with the issue  and the police were becoming more involved  but the gangs still existed  even after individuals were caught and jailed.”His initial experiences led to the publication ofRacketville  Slumtown  Haulburg: An Exploratory Study of Delinquent Subcultures(1964)  a groundbreaking book based on his Ph.D. dissertation. He was also the author ofThe Youth Gang Problem: A Community Approach(1995)  a seminal work that described a model — now commonly referred to as the Spergel model — for intervention that has been adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat gang violence around the country.Spergel said of the model: “This project goes beyond traditional programs  because it facilitates communication and coordinates efforts by all the groups who want to reach out to youth who are seriously at risk of joining gangs or who are violent gang members. It provides opportunities for both adolescents and young adults in gangs to change their lives. All gang kids are not the same  and this model recognizes that and provides different solutions for different problems.”The model calls for a coordinated effort against gangs characterized by community organization and neighborhood mobilization; social intervention  including jobs  job training and education; suppression  including arrest  incarceration and supervision; and organizational development and change.The U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention demonstrated and evaluated the model in Bloomington  Ill.; Mesa and Tucson  Ariz.; Riverside  Calif.; and San Antonio  Texas from 1992 to 1999  proving through quasi-experimental evaluations that the model was successful when correctly implemented.In the years since  the model has been successfully implemented at five additional test sites and has been adopted by more than 20 cities around the country. The model is the central component of the National Gang Center  an OJJDP program that disseminates research on gangs and offers training and assistance to law enforcement  social workers and communities. It was later renamed the OJJDP Comprehensive Gang Model.A test of the model in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago  described in Spergel’s bookReducing Youth Gang Violence(2007)  demonstrated a 40 percent reduction in serious violence for 200 program youth  compared to an equivalent sample of non-served gang youth from the same gangs over a five-year period.Spergel recently contributed a chapter toYouth Gangs and Community Intervention: Research  Practice and Evidence edited by Robert Chaskin  associate professor at SSA. The book  published this year  was created from a series of papers by leading colleagues and gang researchers that were presented at a 2006 conference honoring Spergel’s retirement.At SSA  Spergel helped build the school’s group work program with Mary Lou Somers  Professor Emeritus  and Paul Gitlin  Associate Professor Emeritus at SSA. He also revitalized its community organizing program by linking theory and practice through examples drawn from his grassroots activism and ongoing research in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood.Though retired from the faculty  Spergel continued to do research and lecture  and he was available to faculty  researchers and students until his passing. Most importantly  Spergel wanted to be known and remembered  first and foremost  as a social worker.“Over the course of his career  Spergel has played many roles—youth worker  scholar  teacher  program designer  evaluator  mediator  activist ” Chaskin said. “He embodied a particular orientation to scholarship in the world  and a particular drive to build knowledge that has a real and practical effect on critical social problems of the day.“He embodied the commitment to bridge scholarship and action  and was remarkably successful in concretely translating his research findings and theoretical arguments into policy and practice that could be empirically tested ” Chaskin added.After serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in World War II  Spergel studied at City College of New York and received a B.A. in social sciences in 1946. He went on to earn an M.A. in social work in 1952 from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D. in social work in 1960 from Columbia University. Spergel joined the University faculty in 1960 and was named the George Herbert Jones Professor in 1993. He also held the position of research associate (professor) in the Department of Sociology. He became an emeritus faculty member in 2002.He is survived by his wife  Annot; sons Barry  Mark and Daniel  from his first marriage to Bertha Jampel Spergel (who died in 1989); brothers Philip and Martin; and granddaughters Elizabeth and Sarah.A memorial service will be held at a later date.
                    Charles M. Jacobs  health care pioneer and creative force in the arts  1933-2010            ,Charles M. Jacobs  AB ’53  JD’56  a founding member of the Compass Players improvisational troupe who went on to invent a quality-control methodology that made evidence-based health care widely available  died Oct. 25 in Boston. He was 77 and a resident of Brookline  Mass.Born Charles David Jacobs on May 28  1933  in Brooklyn  N.Y.  he acquired the middle initial “M” through a process now obscure to family members  but it stuck.Jacobs won a scholarship to the University of Chicago at the age of 16. This launched a lifetime of innovation  punctuated by spectacular failures and equally spectacular successes. According to Jacobs  “the University of Chicago saw something in me that no one else saw — they bet on this unknown kid.”Jacobs’ curiosity and willingness to explore all possibilities — “put everything down on a whiteboard” he would say  “don’t say ‘no’ to anything” — resulted in an eclectic career. As an undergraduate  he worked with Paul Sills and David Shepherd to form the “Tonight at 8:30” repertory company. He was one of the initiators of Compass Players  the country’s first improvisational theater and the predecessor of Second City.Although trained as a lawyer rather than a doctor  Jacobs was among the first to realize in the 1970s that health care quality and efficiency could be improved by using evidence-based clinical data to evaluate the appropriateness of medical care and the effectiveness of treatment. By analyzing data at the individual patient level and then aggregating the treatment results for thousands of patients  his approach established expectations for the best achievable care.As associate director of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals from 1970-75  Jacobs established its Quality Review Center and was principal author ofMeasuring the Quality of Patient Care: The Rationale for Outcome Audit(1976). In 1976  Jacobs founded InterQual (now owned by McKesson Robbins) to implement the concept of evidenced-based health care. The InterQual system is now used in the majority of U.S. hospitals  as well as government agencies and private health care plans  to evaluate the level of services required by each patient.“Today we hear and see countless reports about how health care and payment reforms will create the higher-value U.S. health care system we desperately need. Jacobs saw how all this would come together long before others even grasped the potential ” said Stuart Rosenberg  president of Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital  on whose board Jacobs served as an outside director.Jacobs was a tireless teacher and advocate of improving the performance of doctors and hospitals so patients could receive the best care. The real measure of his impact is the clarity of his understanding as to the changes it would take to make the U.S. health care system work most effectively.In a 1987 interview in the AMA’sAmerican Medical News  Jacobs answered a question about how health care quality measurements would evolve over the next decade by predicting: “Payers will be moving toward adopting reimbursement systems that provide financial incentives for high quality  and that will require severity adjustors. The competitive marketplace will reward the qualitative  efficient provider  and penalize the extravagant non-qualitative provider and essentially drive him out of business.”“He is  of course  being proven correct on all fronts  only his dates were a bit off ” Rosenberg noted. “It has taken the system more than 20 years to catch up with implementing  even partially  the reforms he so clearly understood had to happen back in 1987.”Jacobs was listed inMakers & Shakers of America’s Health Policyby Medicine & Health (1985). He received a founder’s award from the American College of Utilization Review Physicians in 1986 for “outstanding contributions to the issues of the Quality of Health Care.” In 1988  the AMA’sAmerican Medical Newsnamed him its man of the year. In 1998 he was made an honorary life member of the American College of Medical Quality.Jacobs’ last creative project was to inspire and help produceMadame White Snake  an opera based on a 1 000-year-old Chinese legend. The opera was a birthday gift from his wife Cerise Lim Jacobs  who wrote the libretto. It started as a song cycle  but Jacobs saw the potential for something much bigger. Soon  the 10-minute piece that was to have been performed in his living room for a small group of friends became a full-length opera commissioned by Opera Boston and the Beijing Music Festival. Acclaimed American Chinese composer Zhou Long composed the music.Directed by Robert Woodruff Madame White Snakehad its world premiere in Boston in February 2010. It became the highest-grossing production in the history of Opera Boston.“Charles’ creative vision  strategic thinking  laser focus  and tireless optimism were central to the project’s success ” said Carole Charnow  former general director of Opera Boston and now president and CEO of Boston Children’s Museum.The opera had its Asia premiere in Beijing on Oct. 27  and the performance was dedicated to Jacobs.“New opera is the most complex art form to create today ” Cerise Jacobs said. “Charles was a man who believed that it is possible for individuals to create beauty in this world and this is the artistic part of his legacy.”In addition to Cerise  Jacobs is survived by his brother  Frank; his children  Emily MacKean  Jessica Jacobs and Pirate Epstein; and grandson  Dashiel Jacobs MacKean.
                    Peter O. Vandervoort  astrophysicist and beloved UChicago mentor  1935-2020            ,Prof. Emeritus Peter O. Vandervoort  an astrophysicist who was trained by legendary scientists at the University of Chicago and spent his career mentoring hundreds of students  colleagues and the public  died Dec. 11. He was 85.Part of the UChicago community for nearly seven decades  Vandervoort  AB’54  SB’55  SM’56  PhD’60  was remembered by colleagues as the resident historian of the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics and a lifelong champion for the University.“In many ways  Peter was the embodiment of the history and culture in the astronomy department  but I also thought of him as embodying the ideals of the University ” said Prof. Richard Kron  a longtime friend and colleague in the department. “He valued your opinion regardless of whether he disagreed  and he had the utmost respect for everyone as human beings and as participants in this academic world  which was really special.”Born April 25  1935 in Detroit  Michigan  Vandervoort enrolled in the University of Chicago as an undergraduate in 1951. As his interest in physics grew  he spent time as a laboratory teaching assistant in a physics laboratory located under the West Stands of Stagg Field  near the site of the first controlled  self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.He started his Ph.D. surrounded by UChicago physicists who would later become legendary names in the field. His advisor wasSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar  who later won the 1983 Nobel Prize; 1963 Nobel laureateMaria Goeppert Mayerwas on his Ph.D. committee;and Robert S. Mulliken  the 1966 Nobel laureate  served on his Ph.D. candidacy examination committee.Of being surrounded by these pioneering scholars  hetold the Manhattan Project Voices: “You’ve been invited to Mount Olympus. What can I say?” He was also friends with Carl Sagan  whom he had met as a fellow UChicago undergraduate  and they kept in touch for many years.After receiving his Ph.D.  he spent time at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the Princeton University Observatory. In 1961 he rejoined the University as an assistant professor  and aside from a brief stint at the Leiden University Observatory in the Netherlands  he would remain at UChicago for the rest of his life.Vandervoort’s area of specialty in astrophysics was stellar dynamics  the study of the movement of stars within galaxies. One of the oldest branches of theoretical astronomy  the field is heavily mathematical. Among other findings  Vandervoort helped fill in gaps in our understanding of the formation of spiral galaxies  calculated the orbits of stars inside these galaxies  and contributed to discussions of the role of chaos in stars and galaxies.“It was clear that he was influenced by Chandrasekhar to think about elegant problems—places where nature would do something really interesting and there was a clever mathematical way of approaching how that process works ” Kron said.One of Vandervoort’s greatest joys  however  was working with students. “That’s a good way to see what an academic is all about  is to look at what kind of students they produce ” Kron said.One such former student  Ellen G. Zweibel  relayed her gratitude for Vandervoort in a letter nominating him for the Norman Maclean Faculty Award for teaching excellence. In 1971  she was a math student in the undergraduate College. She mused to Vandervoort about a possible idea she had; Vandervoort helped flesh it out and found a dataset to study the idea  then wrote it up as a paper.“Although the idea would have been stillborn  and the paper would never have been written without Peter  he made me first author of the paper ” wrote Zweibel  who is now a professor of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Undergraduate research in astronomy is fairly common now  but at that time  it was rare. It was an emotional thunderbolt for me to realize that I could contribute to astronomical knowledge. He was a great mentor to me  and I have always thought that  in some ways  I owe my career to him.”‘He was an institution here’Friends and colleagues recollected that Vandervoort had a particular genius for matching students’ skills and specialties to the areas that suited them best  and that his door was always open.
                    Bishop Arthur M. Brazier  tireless advocate for Woodlawn community  1921-2010            ,Over the course of five decades  Bishop Arthur M. Brazier was a powerful force for change in the Woodlawn community that he loved  and he became a prominent leader on issues of civil rights  education  housing and urban development.Brazier  89  who marched with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  and built a congregation of 22 000 at the Apostolic Church of God  died on Friday  his church announced."Bishop's passing represents a great loss to my family  our church and our community " said a statement from Brazier's son and successor as pastor  Rev. Byron T. Brazier. "We will indeed miss him. Yet  we mourn his passing and celebrate his life with the dignity and grace for which he was known."At the University of Chicago  the many people who worked with Brazier over the years remembered his historic efforts to enrich the community."The University of Chicago community mourns the loss of Bishop Arthur M. Brazier  who worked tirelessly on behalf of his congregation  his neighborhood and his city " said University President Robert J. Zimmer. "For 48 years as pastor of the Apostolic Church of God  Bishop Brazier advanced the causes of education  housing and safety in the Woodlawn community and across the South Side of Chicago. Bishop Brazier's great vision and heart will be missed  as we continue to aspire for the high standards he set.""Bishop Brazier's impact on the city  the University and so many of us personally was deep and profound " said Ann Marie Lipinski  the University's Vice President for Civic Engagement. "He possessed tremendous wisdom that was coupled with a capacity for change and hunger for new learning  even in his final months. Working with him on his expansive vision for children and education in Woodlawn and beyond was an inspiration and privilege  and we remain committed to continuing that work."President Barack Obama on Friday called Brazier a "dear friend  a stalwart of the city of Chicago and one of our nation's leading moral lights." Obama cited Brazier's experience in the Great Depression as a source of commitment in fighting poverty."There is no way that we can replace the gentle heart and boundless determination that Bishop Brazier brought to some of the most pressing challenges facing Chicago and our nation " Obama said. "However  his spirit will live on through the parishioners  leaders and friends that he touched each day."Brazier's influence reached across the South Side  including a long and complex history of relations with the University of Chicago. Some of his earliest efforts as president of The Woodlawn Organization sought to curb the University's expansion south into Woodlawn. But his commitment to the community ultimately led to an array of fruitful partnerships with the University  especially on issues of education  job creation  security and affordable housing."Personally  he changed my life " said Rudy Nimocks  the University's Director of Community Partnerships  who also is a parishioner at Apostolic Church of God. "If you came in contact with him  you'd automatically want to do whatever he was doing. He is a man who comes along once in a long  long while. He'll be an inspiration to me for the rest of my life.""Bishop Brazier is literally among the folks who created community organizing in this country  and he's been a towering civic figure in Chicago " said Charles M. Payne  the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor in the University's School of Social Service Administration. "The Woodlawn Organization was a model for a community and a generation."Born in 1921 in Chicago  Brazier served as a U.S. Army staff sergeant in India and Burma during World War II. He began training for the ministry in 1955  while still a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service. In 1960 he became pastor at the Apostolic Church of God  and he soon joined forces with legendary community organizer Saul Alinsky  with whom he worked successfully to limit the University's building plans in Woodlawn.At a 2008 event to honor Brazier's selection as the first Senior Fellow of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation  he described how his work with the University took a turn for the better over time. He gave much credit to Julian Levi  PhB'29  JD'31  a Law School professor and Hyde Park organizer who led the University's negotiations with The Woodlawn Organization."During those three years of confrontation  Dr. Levi and I stuck to the issues  and at no time did our discussion become personal " Brazier said. "We discovered that our collaborative efforts to plant seeds of community growth and revitalization also resulted in deep roots developing in the soil of friendship."Brazier made strides as pastor and community activist in fostering a vibrant  mixed-income community in Woodlawn. He served as a consultant in the design of the University of Chicago Charter School's Woodlawn campus  which opened in 2006."Bishop Brazier was a moral force for Chicago and the Woodlawn community " said Timothy Knowles  the John Dewey Director of the University's Urban Education Institute. "He was a visionary and master planner  a relentless advocate and wise leader. And throughout  his dedication to children and the improvement of schools knew no bounds."Most recently Brazier served as chair of the Woodlawn Children's Promise Community  an effort to improve the quality of children's lives in the Woodlawn community  from birth through college and into their early careers. The group works in close collaboration with a number of Woodlawn organizations  including the University of Chicago."Bishop Brazier played a crucial role in launching the Woodlawn Children's Promise Community - it's really his brainchild " said Payne  the group's acting director.Brazier is survived by his wife  Esther Isabelle Brazier; his son  Byron T. Brazier; three daughters  Lola Hillman  Janice Dortch and Rosalyn Shepherd; seven grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.The body of Bishop Brazier will lie in state at the Apostolic Church of God on Thursday  Oct. 28  from noon to 6:30pm. The church will hold a homegoing service for the congregation that night from 7pm to 9pm. On Friday  Oct. 29  the church will hold a service for community and national leaders to honor Brazier. Viewing will take place from 8am to 10:30am  and a service will begin at 11am.Related linksMemorial services for Bishop Brazier at the Apostolic Church of Godhttp://acog-chicago.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158&Itemid=279
                    Leigh Van Valen  evolutionary theorist and paleobiology pioneer  1935-2010            ,The originator of the influential and widely debated Red Queen hypothesis  Leigh Van Valen  professor emeritus in the Department of Ecology and Evolution  died at St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital Center in Chicago on Saturday  Oct. 16 from a recurrent respiratory infection. He was 75.A member of the Committees on Evolutionary Biology  Genetics and the Conceptual Foundations of Science at UChicago  Van Valen was an internationally recognized evolutionary biologist known for his theoretical studies of extinction and diversification  the evolutionary and ecological role of energy flow in regulating diversity  and the radiation of mammals after the extinction of the dinosaurs. He was also one of the founders of the field of paleobiology  which combines research on current life forms with the study of fossils to answer questions about the processes shaping large-scale evolutionary and ecological patterns. He was one of the earliest modern advocates for the importance of development in evolution  as captured in his much-quoted aphorism: "Evolution is the control of development by ecology."In his most famous paper  "A New Evolutionary Law " published in 1973  he introduced novel observations and a radical interpretation that together continue to shape the field. The first  which he labeled the law of constant extinction-often called Van Valen's Law-states that the probability of extinction for species and larger evolutionary groups bears no relation to how long it may have already existed. The fossil record  he argued  shows that lineages become neither more extinction-resistant nor more vulnerable over time.To explain this surprising pattern  he proposed the Red Queen hypothesis  a model of co-evolutionary interaction  and one of the most enduring metaphors in modern biology. It holds that the struggle for existence never eases up  so that no species or lineage ever pulls ahead for long. Instead there is a constant arms race among species or larger groups  such as a community of competing lineages or parasites and their hosts. In a world with a fixed amount of energy  each must continually develop new adaptations  weapons or defenses to keep up with the other  a prolonged sequence of mutational one-upmanship.The title comes from Darwin's contemporary  Lewis Carroll. "It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place " the Red Queen tells Alice inThrough the Looking Glass(the sequel toAlice in Wonderland). "If you want to get somewhere else  you must run at least twice as fast as that."Considered unconventional even by eccentrics  Van Valen had a wide range of interests  spanning the history of all life forms. "I don't work linearly " he explained in a note to his department chair. I am a generalist and tend to open new approaches more than fill them in. What I work on changes irregularly and unpredictably with the progress of theory and knowledge.""Leigh Van Valen was an unbelievably broad thinker  uniquely so " recalled his colleague David Jablonski  the William Kenan Jr. Professor in Geophysical Sciences. "The breadth of his work was staggering. He was interested in big questions-in everything  actually-but especially in topics like how diversity came about  how it changed over time."He was also an extraordinary teacher " Jablonski added. "His graduate course on evolutionary processes was legendary. It provided invaluable training for generations of graduate students  many of whom are now the leaders in the field.""Van Valen was an intellectual giant " said former graduate student and colleague Benedikt Hallgrimsson  professor of cell biology and anatomy at the University of Calgary. "People have devoted their entire lives to working out the ramifications of some of his papers. He had a tendency to create seminal works that would send the field off into a new direction of inquiry. He would then move on  never to publish in that field again.""Leigh was a brilliant paleontologist " said Dan McShea  a former graduate student who is now an associate professor of biology and of philosophy at Duke University. "He was one of the top two or three synthetic minds in evolutionary studies in the second half of the 20th century."Leigh M. Van Valen was born Aug. 12  1935  in Albany  N.Y. He showed early promise  being chosen as "most academic " in first grade. He completed his bachelor's degree in zoology at Miami University of Ohio in three years  graduating at the age of 20 with awards in biology  chemistry and poetry  a hobby he maintained. He earned his PhD in 1961 from Columbia University  the epicenter of evolutionary research at the time. He did post-doctoral fellowships at Columbia; University College  London; and the American Museum of Natural History before joining the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1967 as an assistant professor of anatomy. He rose steadily through the ranks  becoming an associate professor in 1971 and a professor in 1976.The author or co-author of more than 300 papers in academic journals  Van Valen managed to remain remarkably productive despite his growing unease with the system that regulates research funding. He worried that relying on grants  from any source  could constrain research into unimaginative ruts. "The required conformity stultified my research " he wrote in an opinion piece forNature. "When one knows just what one will do  it is done." So he found ways to proceed without government grants.He nevertheless held important roles in several professional groups  serving as vice president of the Society for the Study of Evolution and the American Society of Naturalists. He also served on the editorial boards of several journals  including theJournal of Molecular Evolution Evolutionary Biology CarnivoreandCryptozoology  and as assistant editor forEvolutionandPaleobiology. In the 1970s  frustrated by the constraints of narrowly focused specialty publications  he founded and edited two new journals:Evolutionary MonographsandEvolutionary Theory.Van Valen's research papers tended to be "of enormous scope  genuinely imaginative and strikingly original " said Jablonski  yet his ideas were often too innovative  too daring to get printed. "It signaled to Leigh that there was a dearth of outlets for such research. So he launched his own."The paper that introduced the Red Queen hypothesis  rejected by several leading journals  appeared in 1973 on page-1 volume-1 ofEvolutionary Theory. It was soon recognized  said Jablonski  as "one of the most important ideas in modern biology." In 2008 Nature  which had turned down the original study  acknowledged the extraordinary influence of this seminal work  exemplified by numerous follow-up studies confirming Van Valen's 35-year-old theory.Unpredictable and quirky Evolutionary Theorysoon developed loyal readers. "We used to look forward for each issue " Jablonski recalled. Delivery was somewhat irregular  and esthetics incidental  but that was consistent with the journal's motto: "The primacy of content over display."Van Valen felt the same way about his work environment. "His office was breathtaking " said former student and colleague  lecturer Melissa Stoller. At one time  it housed an estimated 30 000 books. It was "a dark labyrinth of stacked shelves " wrote Matt Ridley  a journalist who interviewed Van Valen for his bookThe Red Queen. To reach his source  Ridley had to penetrate "past ziggurats of balanced books and three-foot Babels of paper. Squeeze between two filing cabinets and emerge into a Stygian space the size of a broom cupboard  where there sits an oldish man in a checked shirt  with a grey beard that is longer than God's but not as long as Charles Darwin's."That description  say colleagues  does not do justice to Van Valen's wardrobe. "Pocket protectors " said Stoller. "He was a long-standing supporter of the pocket protector." He selected garments for their pockets. These were filled with 3-by-5 note cards  packed with microscopically small handwriting. "The world was his laboratory " Stoller said  "and he could take notes while conversing."Van Valen is survived by his wife  Virginia Maiorana; daughter  Katrina Van Valen of Richmond  Va.; and his longtime friend  Towako Katsuno  of Chicago and Tokyo. Another daughter  Diane  died in 1995.A memorial service at the University is being planned.
                    Friedrich Katz  Eminent Historian of Mexico            ,Friedrich Katz  recognized as the foremost scholar of Mexican history of his time  died in Philadelphia of cancer on October 16 at the age 83. A professor of history at the University of Chicago for four decades  Katz may be best known for his magisterial account of the Mexican Revolution  which brought Mexican history out of the stuff of legend and onto the world stage of great revolutions and modern social upheavals.Friedrich Katz was born in Vienna in 1927. His father's work as a journalist soon took the family to Berlin  where he joined the resistance when Hitler came to power  eventually fleeing to France to escape arrest.From Paris  Katz's father  posing as a wealthy businessman  smuggled arms to the Spanish Republic. The family was once more forced to flee in 1938  finding temporary asylum in the United States  eventually settling in Mexico in 1941.For the rest of his life  Katz felt deeply grateful to Mexico  which granted his family asylum  under a policy that welcomed who had assisted the Spanish Republican cause and were forced to seek refuge abroad. Friedrich Katz's lifelong passion for Mexican culture was thus ignited from the accidents of geo-political upheaval; the linking of Mexican history to world events became central to his life's work.Educated in Mexico and the United States  Katz eventually earned his doctorate at the University of Vienna. It was in Vienna that he met his wife of 54 years  Jana Badian Katz  who became a pediatrician. His thesis on Aztec society and his subsequent book  The Ancient American Civilizations  first published in German in 1969  remain in print in several languages and are still standard works in the field.Joining the faculty at Humboldt University in East Berlin in 1956  Katz discovered archives revealing Mexico's ambivalent role in European diplomatic history before and during WorldWar I. The research led to Katz's study  The Secret War in Mexico: Europe  the United States  and the Mexican Revolution  published in 1981.In 1968  after the Soviet crushing of the Czech rebellion  Katz left Germany for a guest professorship at the University of Texas. In 1971 he was invited to teach at the University of Chicago. Under his leadership  Chicago became the leading center for Mexican historical studies in the United States.He was named the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor in History.Called a "masterpiece of contemporary historiography" by the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes  Katz's study  The Life and Times of Pancho Villa  won the Beveridge and Bolton book awards in Latin American history. John Coatsworth  Dean of the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and a long-time colleague of Katz's at the University of Chicago  said that "Katz's work  more than that of any other historian succeeded for the first time in inserting Mexico's revolution into global historiography." But Katz's appeal transcended that of an academic historian.His renown in Mexico was such that Mauricio Tenorio  Professor of History at the University of Chicago described him as "respected and belovedthroughout Mexico  by presidents  ex-presidents  colleagues  peasants in Chihuahua and high school students " who flocked to his seminars in Mexico by the hundreds.In recognition for his work  in 1988 Katz received the Order of the Aztec Eagle  the highest honor that Mexico can bestow on a citizen of another country. In 2004  Mexican president Vicente Fox inaugurated theKatz Center for Mexican Studiesat the University of Chicago. On October 18  two days after Katz's death  the Mexican government announced the establishment of the C'ATEDRA CONACULTA-KATZ  a program to support visiting Mexican scholars and creative artists at the University of Chicago. A conference honoring his work  which he had been scheduled to attend  will be held at Columbia University on November 4.Katz is survived by his wife  Jana  his daughter Jacqueline Ross of Champaign Urbana  his son  Leo  of Philadelphia  and four grandchildren.
                    Partha Niyogi  Computer Science Professor  1967-2010            ,University of Chicago Professor Partha Niyogi  who applied computation to the analysis of speech recognition  language evolution and data analysis  died Friday  Oct. 1  at his home in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood  of brain cancer. He was 43.Niyogi  who was the Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics  leaves a deep personal and professional void among his friends and colleagues. "Partha was one of the most beloved and respected people in the department " saidJohn Goldsmith  the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor in Computer Science and Linguistics at UChicago.Ketan Mulmuley  Professor in Computer Science at UChicago  was among many others who echoed those sentiments. "His passing away is a big loss to the field of artificial intelligence  this department  and to me as a friend " Mulmuley said.Niyogi was known among his colleagues as a master of the mathematical and computational techniques that he applied to his specialty of machine cognition and learning. "But what distinguished him was that he was not content with the mastery over the techniques " Mulmuley said. "He also understood their limitations and tried to transcend them. Most importantly  he had a vision."Colleagues remarked as well about Niyogi's wide-ranging intellectual interests  which he pursued with an equally broad  open mind. One of Niyogi's first doctoral students Mikhail Belkin  PhD'03  learned this about his mentor-to-be early on.Belkin  now an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University  met Niyogi in 2000  when both men were new to UChicago. Belkin sought out Niyogi after encountering a convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition."I asked him some questions about the paper  and even though the topic was new to him  he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings " Belkin said. "We made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation. I think this was typical of Partha  showing both his intellectual curiosity and his intuition for the serendipitous."As a specialist in human and machine intelligence  much of Niyogi's work addressed problems related to language acquisition  a process of interest to linguists  psychologists and artificial intelligence researchers. He focused his research on learning and language to see how each works in humans and how they might be replicated in a machine. His ultimate goal was to build computer systems that could interact with and learn from humans.In another major line of research  Niyogi made fundamental contributions to the field of data analysis. In this work  he developed geometrically based methods for inferring hidden patterns from complex data sets related to a variety of problems  including those in image recognition and analysis of spoken language.Niyogi was the author or co-author of more than 90 research publications and sole author of two books:The Informational Complexity of Learning: Perspectives on Neural Networks and Generative Grammar(1998  Kluwer Academic Publishers) andThe Computational Nature of Language Learning and Evolution(2006  MIT Press)  which introduced a mathematical and computational framework for analyzing the interplay between language learning and language evolution.Niyogi was born July 31  1967  in Calcutta (Kolkata)  India. As a child he lived in Bombay (Mumbai)  where he developed a passionate interest in cricket.He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi  India  in 1989. There  Niyogi already began demonstrating his wide-ranging interests  writing a thesis on the automatic recognition of beats on the tabla  a percussion instrument of northern India.His undergraduate thesis then led him to the study of perception  recognition and learning  as well as acoustics  music and language. He earned his master's degree in 1992 and his doctorate in 1995 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  where he interacted with computer scientists  linguists and cognitive scientists more generally.Niyogi married Parvati Krishnamurty in the Hindu temple in Ashland  Mass.  on Nov. 24  1995.He served for a year as a postdoctoral fellow and research associate in MIT's Brain and Cognitive Science Department  and then joined the technical staff at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill  N.J.Niyogi joined the UChicago faculty in 2000 and was named the Louis Block Professor in Computer Science in 2009.Surviving Niyogi are his wife  an economist at the National Opinion Research Center at UChicago; their twin sons  Nikhil and Kabir Niyogi; his parents  Ranjit and Prabhati Niyogi; and a brother  Siddhartha Niyogi.A funeral was held at Lakeview Funeral Home in Chicago on Oct. 6. A memorial service will be held from 2 to 4 p.m. Saturday  Oct. 30  at Bond Chapel on the University campus. A reception will immediately follow in the Divinity School Commons Room.

                    Barry D. Karl  historian of American politics and expert on philanthropy  1927–2010            ,Barry D. Karl  a historian whose study of 20th-century American politics led him to become a leading expert on philanthropy  died Wednesday at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Karl  a Hyde Park resident  was 82.Karl  the Norman and Edna Freehling Professor Emeritus in History  was an authority on the origins of the modern foundation  which began with Andrew Carnegie  John D. Rockefeller and Mrs. Russell Sage.In addition to teaching courses on philanthropy  Karl led a research project on philanthropy with colleague Stanley Katz  later a professor at Princeton University  which traced the impact of philanthropy on American institutions and politics after the Civil War.Karl analyzed how business magnates sought to apply their fortunes to the management of an urban industrial society. Karl connected this new "scientific philanthropy " intended to support research about the roots of social problems  with the creation of structures for developing and applying professionalized expertise. Those included modern American research universities and public policy think tanks  such as the Brookings Institution or the National Bureau of Economic Research.Karl wrote extensively on philanthropy in papers that included  "The Evolution of Corporate Grantmaking in America " "Andrew Carnegie and His Gospel of Philanthropy " "Philanthropy and the Social Sciences " "Philanthropy and Public Policy" (with Katz)  and "Philanthropy and the Secularization of Charity.""Barry Karl was the first major scholar to recognize the role of philanthropy in partnering with government to provide the planning needed by a modern state in a manner consistent with the 'weak state' tradition of the United States " Katz said. "His insight has been the basis for mainstream scholarship on American philanthropy ever since."Neil Harris  the Preston & Sterling Morton Professor Emeritus in History  said  "His vast knowledge of American political and intellectual history was studded with original insights that challenged conventional wisdom. He invariably came up with surprising and challenging observations about what were supposedly settled conclusions."He was especially fascinated by the interplay between individuals and institutions  and the ways in which human personalities helped shape and were shaped by broader historical forces " Harris added. "On the personal side  he was a serious and well-informed music lover  and renowned for his skill in watch making and orchid raising."Karl's interest in the study of philanthropy led to his appointment in 1997 as the first William Henry Bloomberg Professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. The two-year term professorship was endowed by Michael Bloomberg  now mayor of New York  in memory of his father  and was part of a new program on the study of philanthropy and its impact on society.Karl first engaged with the history of public management when  as an editor at the University of Chicago Press  he helped Louis Brownlow  one of founders of the field of public administration  write his autobiography. Fascinated by the complex and contentious relationship between democratic politics and managerial power  Karl studied the theory and practice of public policy in 20th-century America.He was the author ofExecutive Reorganization and Reform in the New Deal(1963) Charles E. Merriam and the Study of Politics(1974)  andThe Uneasy State: The United States from 1915 to 1945(1985).A native of Louisville  Ky.  Karl received a BA from the University of Louisville in 1949  an MA from UChicago in 1951 and a PhD from Harvard in 1961. He served on the faculties of Harvard  Washington University in St. Louis and Brown University before joining the Chicago faculty in 1971.Karl was chair of the History Department at Chicago from 1976-79 and served in other capacities at the University."He was not only a close colleague and friend  a fine scholar and exceptional teacher  but he was also an unusually effective and committed citizen of the University  deeply versed in its history and concerned for the sustenance of its special character " said Hanna Gray  the Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor Emerita and President Emerita of the University.Gray added that Karl served on many important and influential committees  "and was for some years a senior advisor in the President's office." Among his many contributions  she noted Karl's role in planning for the development of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies and in the design of the academic conferences of the University's centennial year.Karl is survived by his wife  Alice; daughters  Elisabeth Karl and Sarah Karl Schroeder; grandson  Ethan Schroeder; brother  Leo Karl; niece  Amy Johnson; nephew  David Karl; and son-in-law  Paul Schroeder.
                    Ian Woo Cumings ‘eloquent and mature’ College student  dies in auto accident            ,Ian Woo Cumings  a rising fourth-year in the College at the University of Chicago  died June 27 from injuries he suffered in an automobile accident in central Virginia.Born April 27  1989  Cumings  21  was the third generation at the University; his grandfather and grandmother met here and graduated in the 1930s. His father  Bruce Cumings  is the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor in History and the College.A dean's list student majoring in Germanics and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity  Cumings was well known for possessing a quiet and warm spirit."He distinguished himself through his class work  but impressed me even more as a human being " said Associate Professor of American History Adam Green  who taught "Introduction to Black Chicago  1893-2005" during the fall of 2008."Eager to learn about new worlds  and dedicated to further developing impressive skills  Ian was also remarkably kind and gentle."Malynne Sternstein  an Associate Professor of Slavic Studies  and Chair of Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities  observed Cumings' quick wit  acumen and pointed analytical skills when she had him in her Vladimir Nabokov course this spring."His work was eloquent and mature  sophisticated and canny " Sternstein said. "All these things: his insight  his sensitivity to the nuances of others' voices  his grace in finding his own  all these things and more speak to an exceptional life. I will miss his voice."Ian was born and raised in Chicago  attending the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor  Mich.Cumings loved sports  especially the Chicago White Sox.He played Little League baseball  and in his senior year in high school was a member of the Michigan state championship tennis team. He loved to manage football  baseball and basketball teams in the fantasy leagues.In addition to his father  Cumings is survived by his mother Meredith Jung-En Woo  who is Dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia  and a younger brother  Benjamin.A memorial service will be held at the University in the fall.

                    John Haugeland  scholar and former Philosophy Department chair  1945–2010            ,John Haugeland  a scholar known for his work on philosophy of mind  died June 23 following a May 22 heart attack that occurred during a conference held in his honor. He was 65.At theconference  James Conant  Chairman of Philosophy and the Chester D. Tripp Professor in Humanities  Philosophy and the College  praised Haugeland’s “profound and lasting contributions to many different areas of philosophy.” In particular  Conant noted Haugeland’s work on the existentialist philosopher Heidegger and on the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence.Haugeland  the David B. and Clara E. Stern Professor Emeritus in Philosophy  joined the Chicago faculty in 1999. From 2004–07  he was chair of the Philosophy Department.“He was an exemplary chair ” said Robert Pippin  the Evelyn Stefansson Nef Distinguished Service Professor of Social Thought  Philosophy and the College. “John had absolutely no shred of egoism. He was very sweet and very considerate  but he was also someone with firmly–held principles about philosophy and academic life.”Born March 13  1945  Haugeland received his BS in Physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1966  and his PhD in philosophy from the University of California  Berkeley in 1976. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh from 1974 until coming to UChicago in 1999.Haugeland’s book Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea(1985)  has been translated into five languages. It received acclaim not only for its analysis of artificial intelligence  but also for its lucid and engaging style.That down–to–earth quality was typical of Haugeland’s work  said Clark Remington  a graduate student who worked closely with Haugeland until his death. In his well–known paper  “The Intentionality All–Stars ” Haugeland explored the philosophical debate over intentionality by assigning various philosophers to different positions in baseball. “It’s a delightful  hilarious article describing who in the field would be second base  left field  pitcher  etc.  and it’s incredibly insightful. It’s typical that he would use humor to get right to the heart of something ” Remington said.In 1998  Haugeland publishedHaving Thought: Essays in the Metaphysics of Mind  a collection of essays from throughout his career. “If I had to do a ‘how–to’ book on ‘how to do philosophy ’ this essay would be one I would dissect at length  revealing its virtues ” philosopher Daniel C. Dennett wrote of Haugeland’s essay “Representational Genera.”In 2003  Haugeland received a Guggenheim Fellowship to begin work onHeidegger Disclosed  a bold and unique reinterpretation of Heidegger’sBeing and Time. At the time of Haugeland’s death  the book was two–thirds complete. “If it’s published  it’s sure to be one of the most important works on Heidegger ” said Pippin.Family and friends remember Haugeland’s quick wit and his caring relationship with his colleagues. “Everyone knew he had a deep love and concern for philosophy and for his students ” Remington said.In his spare time  Haugeland was an avid movie–watcher who loved the Coen brothers and never tired ofThe Princess Bride  said his wife Joan Wellman.A gifted woodworker and handyman  Haugeland liked to boast that he “certainly owned more nuts and bolts than most philosophers (and possibly more than any).”Family friend Robbie Kendall remembers  “If there was something that needed to be fixed  his first instinct was to fix it.”In addition to his wife  Haugeland is survived by his sisters  Cyndi Munch and Carol Magnuson; his son  John Christian Haugeland III; and his stepdaughters  Jennifer Swain and Emma Wellman.In lieu of flowers  donations may be sent to the University of Chicago Philosophy Department  Stuart 202  1115 E. 58th St.  Chicago  IL 60637  for the John Haugeland Undergraduate Fund.
                    Angela Gugliotta  environmental historian and College lecturer  1963–2010            ,Angela Gugliotta  a teacher of environmental history whose research challenged the categorical distinction between natural and social knowledge  died June 1 after a 10-year battle with breast cancer. She was 47.Funeral services were held June 7 at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Hyde Park.Gugliotta served as lecturer in the College and research associate in the Humanities Division since 2002. Her teaching was primarily in Environmental Studies and the Humanities Core."Angela was a gifted scholar  a fine teacher and a dedicated mentor to our students " said Mark Lycett  director of the Program on the Global Environment that administers the Environmental Studies major in the College. "She was an incisive and creative voice in our program and her contributions are irreplaceable."At the time of her death Gugliotta was working to revise her dissertation for publication. "'Hell with the Lid Taken Off:' A Cultural History of Air Pollution-Pittsburgh" was a broad-based exploration of "the meaning of smoke to the city" during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Michael Kremer  Gugliotta's husband and Professor in Philosophy and the College  plans to complete the revisions for the History of the Urban Environment Series published by the University of Pittsburgh Press.Gugliotta received her BS in Mathematics from Carnegie-Mellon University  an MA in Philosophy from Johns Hopkins University and her MA and PhD in History from the University of Notre Dame.When Gugliotta first moved to the University with Kremer  she quickly sought opportunities to teach  despite having recently been diagnosed with breast cancer."My first thought was that she would be ill-advised to take on college teaching as well " said Ted Steck  Professor Emeritus in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology  and founder of the Environmental Studies program. Instead  Gugliotta"plunged into her professorial duties with full force and great impact. The students loved her - she was so committed  knowledgeable  intellectually engaged  effective  caring and nice."Gugliotta taught more than a dozen courses at Chicago after her appointment as lecturer in the College in 2002  including "Environment and the Body " "Ideas of Nature " "Environment and Environmentalism in American History " and "Environment and Technology in History."John Boyer  the Martin A. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor in History and Dean of the College  said  "Angela brought her deep knowledge of environmental history  science and policy to bear in her teaching  and in ways that her students always found positive and insightful and encouraging of individual opinion."In addition to her courses  Gugliotta directed the theses for undergraduates majoring in Environmental Studies; History; History  Philosophy  and Social Studies of Science and Medicine (HiPSS); and Law  Letters and Society."It was obvious from the first few classes I ever took with her that she was passionate about what she studied " said Greg Fahl  AB'10. "But what really set her apart both as a professor and person was her incredible warmth and compassion."Gugliotta is survived by her husband; their children Lucia  Teresa and Roswitha Gugliotta-Kremer; and her mother  Gloria Gugliotta.-Thomas GaulkinAn extended version of this story appears on the website of the Program on the Global Environment:http://pge.uchicago.edu/news/2009-2010/100609-gugliotta-obituary.shtml.
                    Morton Arnsdorf  cardiologist  mentor and physician-scientist  1940-2010            ,A nationally renowned cardiologist  best known for his basic research on abnormal heart rhythms and the molecular structure of drugs to treat them  and a pioneer in applying nanotechnology to the study of biomedical problems  Morton F. Arnsdorf  professor emeritus and associate vice chairman of medicine and former section chief of cardiology at the University of Chicago  died June 9 in a motor vehicle accident in Indiana on his way home from work. He was 69.An accomplished physician  researcher and teacher  Arnsdorf studied the biochemical and electrical mechanisms that regulate the heartbeat and that can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation. He was among the first to define how cell-cell communications control the heartbeat  and to show the complex ways that changes in active and passive electrical properties of the heart lead to arrhythmias. His work led to a basic understanding of the electrophysiologic actions of antiarrhythmic drugs used to treat life-threatening heart rhythms like ventricular tachycardia.He also led a team of researchers that made significant advances in understanding the risk of heart disease in women  which brought him the American Heart Association's Women in Cardiology Mentoring Award.More recently  he and colleagues applied nanotechnology to a variety of biomedical problems. In the early 1990s  they began using a new tool  atomic force microscopy  to study the molecular connections known as gap junctions between adjoining heart muscle cells  one of the first applications of this technology to biological problems.Arnsdorf's team was the first to report what they called "nanodissection " using a probe a few atoms thick to scrape off part of the surface of a cell to study the workings of ion channels embedded in the cell wall. Arnsdorf and a colleague later patented the use of biospecific probes with the nanoscale scope. These were attached to the probe and designed to interact with a specific protein or microscopic structure on a biological specimen.His peers recognized these accomplishments by electing him a master of the American College of Cardiology  an honor bestowed on fewer than 60 cardiologists in the United States."Mort Arnsdorf was a key player in cardiology for more than three decades " said colleague Jafar Al-Sadir  professor of medicine. "He was just a remarkable guy  a close friend  a consistently decent man  and a wonderful doctor  scientist and teacher. A lot of the leading people in the field owe much of their success to him  his ability to help scholars in training find their niche and make the connections that helped launch their careers.""Mort started his research career in my lab " recalled colleague Rory Childers  professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. "As a resident  he had been allotted three contiguous months for research. In this short time he formulated and completed a project  explaining the connections between elevated thyroid hormone and atrial fibrillation  which he published in a leading journal Circulation Research. He never looked back after that.""He was also good fun " Childers added. "He had a tremendous sense of humor  a lot of good friends and a calm  steady personality. His ability to see both sides and moderate a dispute made him a terrific chief of cardiology  a position he held for nine years."Although a skilled moderator  Arnsdorf was deeply moral and never afraid to "say what needed to be said  speaking truth to power " said Stephen Archer  the University's current chief of cardiology. "He took a stand. If he felt an idea or a project conflicted with the University's core missions or threatened some part of patient care or the training program  he could be quite direct and forceful and he wasn't afraid of the consequences.""Mort was a leader in cardiology nationally and in the Midwest " Archer added  "yet humble despite the fact that he held many important leadership roles. When it came to academic medicine in America  Mort knew everyone and was widely respected. I respected him tremendously and he was beloved by the cardiology trainees and faculty and his many patients."Born Aug. 7  1940  in Chicago  the son of a primary care doctor  Morton Frank Arnsdorf earned his bachelor's degreemagna cum laudefrom Harvard University in 1962 and his medical degree from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1966. He came back to Chicago for his residency training at the University of Chicago Hospitals from 1966 to 1969  and then completed a two-year cardiology fellowship at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. From 1971 to 1973 he served in the United States Air Force  rising to the rank of major and serving as chief of cardiology at the Air Force hospital in Elmendorf  Alaska.He came to Chicago as an assistant professor of medicine in 1973 and never left. He was promoted to associate professor in 1979 and to professor in 1983. He became chief of cardiology in 1981 and held the role until 1990. During this period the section gained strength and enhanced its national reputation for research and for training future leaders. He took on the role of vice chairman for appointments and promotions in 2004 and maintained that role despite taking on emeritus status and cutting back to half time in 2008.A prolific researcher  Arnsdorf authored or co-authored more than 100 articles in scientific and clinical journals. He was a co-editor ofUptoDate in Cardiology a widely consulted  continuously updated electronic database of current practices in cardiac care. He also served on the editorial boards of many research publications  includingCirculation Research  where he was an associate editor for five years  theJournal of the American College of Cardiology  theJournal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine  and others.Arnsdorf held several prestigious national and regional positions. He served on the American College of Cardiology's board of governors and as a trustee and secretary of the organization. He was president of the ACC's Illinois chapter from 1991 to 1994. He was on the board of directors of the American Heart Association and served as president of the AHA's Chicago chapter. He was a founding member of the Association of Professors of Cardiology and president of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Society.He also received multiple honors including Master of the American College of Cardiology  the ACC's Distinguished Fellow Award  and the AHA's Women in Cardiology Mentoring Award. Most recently  he received the University of Chicago Department of Medicine's Distinguished Service Award.He wore those honors lightly  said his wife  Rosemary Crowley. "He was completely unassuming  no arrogance  no self-promotion." He was much prouder of learning  late in life  to play Hawaiian slack-key guitar. "He was most proud " she said  "of the people he had mentored.""There was this bit of a Galahad about him " Crowley said  "a champion of the underdog. He could sense who might be struggling with a project  and how to help them focus. This often led to something outstanding. Many of his former students are now quite successful academic physicians."Crowley points out that  no underdog  she picked him. A social worker and hospice director at the University of Chicago Medical Center  she often worked with Arnsdorf to help his patients with their non-clinical needs. Both were divorced  so she called and asked him out. It worked. They began dating in 1980 and married in 1986.

                    Martin Gardner  AB’36  prolific author and prominent skeptic  1914–2010            ,Martin Gardner  AB'36  a writer on wide-ranging subjects who achieved some of his greatest renown as author of the "Mathematical Games" column inScientific American  died May 22 in Norman  Okla.  at age 95.Gardner received his undergraduate degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago and went on to publish more than 70 books  on topics ranging from the foibles of pseudoscience to the fiction of Lewis Carroll. His long-running commitment to skeptical thinking and making technical subjects accessible to the public earned him widespread praise among professional scholars."Many have tried to emulate him " the mathematician Ronald Graham said of Gardner in 2009  according to theWashington Post'sobituary. "No one has succeeded."Gardner was born on Oct. 21  1914  in Tulsa  Okla.  where he returned after college to work on theTulsa Tribune. He came back to the University of Chicago to work in the News Office; he also wrote interviews and the News of the Quadrangles section for theUniversity of Chicago Magazine. His association with the magazine continued in later years  including a 1975 piece on "The Magic Hexagon." He also wrote a semi-autobiographical novel The Flight of Peter Fromm(1944)  about a Divinity School student at UChicago.Gardner wrote hisScientific Americancolumn from 1956 to 1981  sparking curiosity and enthusiasm from experts and non-experts alike. He often said that his skill in mathematics was slight  but with effort he made that an asset in writing his columns."The big secret of my success as a columnist was that I didn't know much about math " Gardner toldNew York Timeswriter John Tierney in 2009. "I had to struggle to get everything clear before I wrote a column  so that meant I could write it in a way that people could understand."Related LinksNew York TimesScientific AmericanobituaryScientific AmericanprofileThe Timesof LondonUniversity of Chicago PressWashington Post
                    Jack Steinberger  Nobel-winning physicist and UChicago alum  1921-2020            ,Jack Steinberger  a Nobel Prize-winning scientist whose distinguished career in experimental physics began as a University of Chicago student  died Dec. 12 at the age of 99.Steinberger  SB’42  PhD’49  was most famous for his co-discovery of a new type of ghostlike particle called the muon neutrino—a breakthrough that earned him  Leon Lederman and Melvin Schwartz theNobel Prize in Physicsin 1988. Steinberger studied the basic particles that make up the universe  and the elemental forces that govern their interactions  over a long scientific career that was jump-started by Enrico Fermi and other UChicago mentors; the discovery of the muon neutrino was only one achievement in decades of extraordinary contributions to physics.After arriving in Chicago as a child in 1934 as a refugee from Nazi Germany  Steinberger attended New Trier Township High School. At first he took college classes at the University of Chicago in the evenings while helping with the family store on the weekends.Shortly before he finished his undergraduate degree  Pearl Harbor was bombed and he enrolled in the Army. Steinberger was given an introductory course in electromagnetic wave theory through the University of Chicago and sent to the MIT radiation laboratory  where he helped develop bomb sights for aerial raids he told theCERN Courier.After the war  Steinberger rejoined the University of Chicago to pursue his Ph.D. At that time the department was filled with pioneering names in physics and chemistry  including Fermi  Edward Teller and Robert S. Mulliken  and many of the students who studied there would become legends in their own right.“It was a wonderful atmosphere  both between professors and students and also among the students ” Steinbergerrecalled in his Nobel autobiography. “The courses of Fermi were gems of simplicity and clarity  and he made a great effort to help us become good physicists.”Though Steinberger was initially interested in theoretical physics  Fermi encouraged him to pursue an experiment to test a theory Steinberger had proposed about cosmic rays. The nudge took; Steinberger would spend the vast majority of his career in experimental physics. “Fermi was the biggest luck I had in my life!” Steinberger told theCERN Courier.Steinberger spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and a year at the University of California Berkeley  where he made multiple experimental breakthroughs but left after refusing to sign an anti-Communist loyalty oath.He then moved to Columbia University  where at nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory in the early ‘60s  he would undertake a landmark experiment to produce neutrinos—the “ghost” particles that zip through us undetected all the time  but had been difficult to study. In the stream of particles that he  Lederman and Schwartz produced  it became clear that there was not just one kind of neutrino; in addition to the expected particle  there was also one that was called the muon neutrino. The breakthrough also pointed the way toward new techniques to study the “weak force ” one of the four basic forces of nature  and is regarded as a fundamental pillar of the understanding of the basic particles that still stands today.Prof. Jack Steinberger discusses his life and scientific career in this 2008 interview. (Video courtesy of Nobel Foundation)In 1968  Steinberger joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)  where he would remain for the rest of his career. Among his accomplishments were serving as spokesperson for an electron-positron collider called LEP  which took crucial measurements that confirmed the Standard Model of the unified electro-weak and strong interactions.“He was a remarkable scientist and person. His career and the work he did spanned much of the history of particle physics ” said Prof. Ed Blucher  who worked with Steinberger at CERN and kept in touch as a personal friend. “He had an uncanny ability to look at problems with great clarity  instantly understanding the key issues. This talent  combined with his deep knowledge of physics  led to five decades of groundbreaking experiments.”J. Peter May  a professor of mathematics at UChicago  has fond memories of Steinberger  who was his cousin. He recalled that in 1955 Steinberger took him to a lecture at Brookhaven by Owen Chamberlain  another University of Chicago PhD and Nobel-winning physicist. “I was the only kid there  and it was a life-changing experience ” May said. “I knew right away that I wanted to be a part of the research world.”May remembers Steinberger as “a scintillating man  wonderfully good-humored and unbelievably modest about all that he had achieved.” Well into his 80s  May said  Steinberger was still riding his bicycle to work at CERN from his home in Geneva.Steinberger is survived by his second wife  Cynthia Alff; four children  Julia  John  Joseph and Richard; and four grandsons.
                    Jo Desha Lucas  expert on local government and federal civil procedure  1921–2010            ,Jo Desha Lucas  a professor in the University of Chicago Law School and an expert on local government and federal civil procedure  died May 9 in the University of Chicago Medical Center. He was 88.A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday  June 17 at the Weymouth Kirkland Courtroom of the Law School  1111 E. 60th St.Lucas joined the Law School faculty in 1953 as assistant professor and dean of students. He became a full professor in 1961 and was named the Arnold I. Shure Professor of Urban Law in 1984."Jo Lucas was already a veteran of almost 30 years at the Law School when I arrived in 1981 " said Richard Helmholz  the Ruth Wyatt Rosenson Distinguished Service Professor in the Law School."He was then  and he always continued to be  a genial and welcoming colleague  ready to share the many things he knew from the school's history."Lucas taught courses on civil procedure  federal courts  admiralty  local government  state and local taxation  torts  Indian law  labor law and legislation. He had a longtime interest in local governments and their rules  and his courses on state and local government and taxation probed the problems of state and city government at the local level."As a scholar he made important contributions to the modernization of rules of procedure in the federal and state courts " said Helmholz  who best knew Lucas' work in the law of admiralty. "He handled that difficult but fascinating subject with the care of a true professional  but also with a certain flair that fit both Jo's character and that of the law on which he wrote."A native of Virginia and a member of a distinguished family from Kentucky  students and colleagues also recalled his southern accent and friendly charm."Former students of his remember him fondly for his practical and sympathetic help as dean of students and for his classes  peppered with anecdotes and colorful imagery " according to a 1986 article in the Law School Record  a publication of the Law School.He was a member and former chairman of the Illinois Supreme Court Rules committee and also served as reporter to the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules for the federal courts. Among his publications are Cases on Admiralty and Moore's Federal Practice  with former Law School faculty member James W. Moore.Lucas was the major reviser of the work that Moore first wrote in the 1930s - Moore's Federal Practice  which is one of two standard works on federal civil procedures. For many years  Lucas wrote annual supplements and later served as its chief editor."Lucas' work is vitally important to the practice of law. No practicing lawyer can be without a treatise on federal practice and procedure " the Record observed. Lucas was working on the sixth edition of his book  Admiralty Cases and Materials (Foundation Press).Lucas grew up in Richmond and was a descendent of the Desha family  a family that includes Joseph Desha  a hero of the War of 1812 who was a congressman and governor of Kentucky. Lucas maintained his links to Kentucky by dressing in a linen suit from time to time at the Law School Wine Mess to show students how to make a perfect mint julep the day before the Kentucky Derby.He received both an AB in 1947 and an MPA in 1951 from Syracuse University  an LLB in 1951 from the University of Virginia and a LLM in 1952 from Columbia University.Survivors include his wife  Johanna Lucas; daughter  Robin Burgess; son  John (Claudia) Lucas; and grandson  Jo Desha Burgess.
                    Max Palevsky  entrepreneur who helped shape UChicago campus  1924-2010            ,Computer pioneer Max Palevsky  PhB’48  SB’48  whose generosity helped shape many aspects of the University and its campus  died of heart failure May 5 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 85.Palevsky  a noted art collector  political activist and former trustee  was a founder and director of Intel Corporation in Santa Clara."Max Palevsky would often say that the University of Chicago 'changed his life ' and in his own carefully considered ways  he worked to make the transformation that he experienced at Chicago available to others " said Hugo Sonnenschein  President Emeritus of the University and the Adam Smith Distinguished Service Professor of Economics. He "will forever stand tall among those who best represent what our rigorous variety of education makes possible."Palevsky was born July 24  1924 to Polish immigrant parents in Chicago. After high school  he entered the U.S. Army and served as a meteorologist in the Philippines during World War II.After the war  he attended UChicago  where he earned bachelor's degrees in math and philosophy. He did graduate work in mathematics and philosophy here  as well as at UCLA  where he also taught.It was his time at Chicago  Palevsky said  that had the greatest impact."My whole life has been shaped by the time spent as a College student at Chicago " he said in an interview with the University in 1996  after he gave $5 million to endow the Palevsky Faculty Fund  earmarked to enhance faculty excellence. "It gave me a notion of  and enthusiasm for  all that was out there in the world. It gave me a sense of the terrain of learning and of the limitless horizons of discovery."In 2000  Palevsky pledged $20 million to the University to enhance the quality of residential life on campus. The Max Palevsky Residential Commons was born from the gift. His generosity was also behind Max Palevsky Cinema and the Palevsky Professorship in History and Civilization in 1972. Palevsky served as a University Trustee from 1972 to 1982."Max was an extraordinary person in every respect  and his dedication to the University and to the College was remarkable " said John Boyer  Dean of the College. "Max's gifts to the University had a fundamental impact in improving student life on campus and in strengthening our academic programs."Max Palevsky is survived by his wife Jodie Evans; his daughter Madeleine Moskowitz; his sons Nicholas  Alexander  Jonathan and Matthew; his stepson Jan Krajewski III; four grandchildren; and his sister Helen Futterman.
                    Milton Ehre  Russian literature expert  1933-2009            ,Milton Ehre  an authority on 19th-century Russian drama and Professor Emeritus in Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Chicago  died Tuesday  June 30 at Rush Oak Park Hospital. Ehre  76  was a resident of River Forest.Ehre joined the Chicago faculty in 1967 and was a celebrated teacher as well as a researcher and translator of Russian literature. In 1999 he received a Quantrell Award  which the University gives annually to faculty for exceptional work with undergraduates.Ehre was particularly interested in teaching undergraduates and devoted to teaching in the humanities core curriculum."The role of the teacher is to make himself superfluous " Ehre said at the time. "The less they need you  the better the teacher you are. It's like being a parent."He said he chose his profession based on the examples of those who came before him. "The teachers I had in high school seemed to be happy people " said Ehre  who as a teenager decided he wanted to follow in their footsteps.After earning a bachelor's degree in English from The City College of New York in 1955  he taught junior high and high school in the New York public school system.He began studying Russian as a hobby.In 1970  he earned his doctorate in Russian from Columbia University  after he had already been teaching at the University of Chicago for three years."Milt was a wise teacher and colleague to us all. His literary sensibility was impeccable  and his books (including his translations) were invaluable contributions to our knowledge of nineteenth-century Russian literature. We have lost a scholar and man of enormous stature " said Robert Bird  Chair of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University.In 1973 Ehre published his first book Oblomov and His Creator: The Life and Art of Ivan Goncharov  for which V.S. Pritchett (writing in theNew York Review of Books) praised Ehre's "close knowledge of Russian critical writing and his observation of the detail of Goncharov's impulses and methods as a novelist."His second book Isaac Babel was published in 1986. In addition to these books and a score of major essays  Ehre was also an accomplished translator  publishing many translations of Russian poetry  as well as his 1980 book The Theater of Nikolay Gogol(co-translated with Fruma Gottschalk)  and the 1992 volume Chekhov for the Stage.He prepared a new translation of the Chekov classic "Uncle Vanya" for a 1986 performance at the University's Court Theatre. He said the demands on a translator are different for the spoken as compared to the written word."Sometimes the most lexically correct translation will sound wrong on the stage " he explained of his work. "That's when I look for something else  less precise perhaps  but more believable."His translations of Gogol and Chekhov plays were also performed on the BBC  at the Goodman Theater  at the Pearl Theater in New York and theaters around the country.In 2005 Ehre worked with his daughter Julieanne Ehre  an artistic director  on a production of Gogol's play  "The Nose " for a performance in Chicago.In 1999  as a guest of the Academy of Science of Russia  he was a member of a commission for the creation of the history of Russian literature in the 20th century.Ehre held two Fulbright-Hays Fellowships and grants from the American Council of Learned Societies  the Philosophical Society  the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Guggenheim Foundation. He was a member of the editorial board of theSlavic and East European Journal. He retired in 1992  but continued teaching.Services will be held at noon Friday  July 3 at Oak Park Temple at 1235 N. Harlem Ave.  Oak Park.Ehre is survived by his wife Roberta  his daughters Joelle and Julieanne  their husbands Peter Henderson and Hans Detweiler  and his grandchildren Milo Henderson and Esther and Avi Detweiler.
                    Robert Bird  prolific scholar of Russian literature and film  1969–2020            ,Prof. Robert James Douglas Bird—an expert on Russian literature  film and modernism—died Sept. 7 in Chicago after a nine-month battle with colon cancer. He was 50.A prolific author and lecturer  Bird’s interest in Russia ranged from its literary giants and artists  to the country’s aesthetics  socialism and revolution. His scholarship encompassed the global and local; he was equally at home in Moscow and Chicago.“Robert’s outstanding biographical and critical work made a lasting impression on the fields of Russian literature  cinema and intellectual history ” said Anne Walters Robertson  dean of the Division of the Humanities and the Claire Dux Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Music. “As a legendary teacher and mentor  he also will be sorely missed.”Bird was a leading authority on the director Andrei Tarkovsky  about whom he wrote two books. Best known is his 2008 monographAndrei Tarkovsky: Elements of Cinema  which has been translated into Chinese  Farsi and Portuguese  and will be published in Russian later in 2020 using Bird’s own translation.In anessay published shortly after his death  Bird reflected on his struggle with cancer—a disease that also claimed Tarkovsky’s life in 1986  when the filmmaker was 54. “But reading Tarkovsky’s diary over his final year  I recognise much of what he experienced ” Bird wrote. “Not just the deleterious physical effects  but the emotional and spiritual ones  the loss of systems within which my life has been constructed  the ubiquity of fear.“Suddenly the membrane separating Tarkovsky’s world from mine has become finer  as if I can touch more directly something he experienced so privately  so mutely.”Bird completed a draft of his Russian translation ofAndrei Tarkovskyin January  while receiving his first chemotherapy infusion. Just days before his death  he completed work toward a volume of his collected essays in Russian  which will be published in Russia in the seriesSovremennaia Rusistika. Bird was also finishing a highly anticipated book Soul Machine: How Soviet Film Modeled Socialism  which represents tremendous labor over many years.His other works include his first full-length bookThe Russian Prospero  a 2006 study of the poetry and thought of Viacheslav Ivanov; a 2012 biography ofFyodor Dostoevsky; multiple translations of Russian religious thought; and many essays and articles in both English and Russian.Bird’s scholarship frequently took him abroad  from teaching spring courses at the University of Chicago Center in Paris  to summer film festivals around the world  international conferences  and research trips to Russian film and literary archives.“Robert was a man of many worlds  a uniquely versatile intellectual and a tower of strength for Slavic studies at UChicago ” said Boris Maslov  a former faculty member in UChicago’s Department of Comparative Literature who now teaches at the University of Oslo. “Reading the articles he published during these past months—on Soviet gardening metaphors  on sacrifice and omens—makes one admire his moral strength  open-mindedness and talent.”
                    Richard P. Taub  esteemed sociologist who studied Chicago neighborhoods  1937–2020            ,Editor’s note: The campus community is invited to a virtual memorial for Prof. Richard Taub at 4 p.m. CST Jan. 21. RSVP to attend viathe Zoom registration link.Richard P. Taub  a prolific and wide-ranging University of Chicago sociologist who dedicated his career to studying urban economic development and public policy  especially in Chicago neighborhoods  died Aug. 19. He was 83.The Paul Klapper Professor Emeritus in the Social Sciences  the Department of Comparative Human Development and the Department of Sociology  Taub studied economic development  entrepreneurship  community development  poverty and public policy for five decades at UChicago. He also founded the undergraduate public policy major in the 1970s and chaired it for 35 years.“Some people are born to be leaders  and Richard Taub was one of them ” said Richard Shweder  the Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Comparative Human Development and Taub’s friend of more than 50 years. “His candor  compassion  decency  commitment to students  dedication to interdisciplinary scholarship  entrepreneurial talents and ability to transcend factional differences made him beloved to his colleagues and the department’s natural leader.”Born in Brooklyn  New York on April 16  1937  Taub earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan in 1959  then went on to Harvard University  where he earned his MA in 1962 and PhD in 1966. At Harvard  he was mentored by sociologist Alex Inkeles and anthropologist Cora Du Bois  who encouraged him to go to India  where he did his first field research. Taub focused his dissertation on the challenges faced by the Indian Administrative Service during the modernization of the Indian state of Orissa (now Odisha)—research that became the foundation of his first book Bureaucrats Under Stress: Administrators and Administration in an Indian State. This work also laid the groundwork for his later bookEntrepreneurship in India's Small-Scale Industries: An Exploration of Social Contexts(with Doris L. Taub)  which explored the potentials and limits of government intervention in supporting small business development.After beginning his academic career at Brown University  Taub joined the UChicago faculty in 1969  and expanded his field research to include Chicago-based urban sociology. He eventually became a leading proponent of immersive sociology fieldwork in the city in which he worked. Taub required his graduate students not only to observe community spaces  like bars and laundromats  but also to befriend people in the neighborhoods where they were conducting research.“People who don’t do field research sometimes assume that it’s easy. But it isn’t. It requires that you build trust ” Taub toldThe University of Chicago Chroniclein 2004. “It’s not like an experiment where you’re paying people to participate. You depend on your ability to create good will in order to make successful fieldwork happen. And you have to make sense of the rich and diverse activity bombarding your senses.”In Chicago  Taub focused on demographic turnover and the problems caused by practices like redlining  which lead to disinvestment and the decline of local communities. He also studied howlocal solidarity could keep communities strongandreinvestment could make weakened communities strongagain. His major works in this area includePaths of Neighborhood Change(with D. Garth Taylor and Jan D. Dunham);Community Capitalism: Banking Strategies and Economic Development; andThere Goes the Neighborhood: Racial  Ethnic  and Class Tensions in Four Chicago Neighborhoods and their Meaning for America(with William Julius Wilson).Taub’s research inCommunity Capitalismfocused on the role of the South Shore Bank in the local community. When the bank was asked by then-Gov. Bill Clinton and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation to create the country’s first rural community development bank in Arkansas  Taub extended his research to that state  eventually writing the research monographDoing Development in Arkansas: Using Credit to Create Opportunity for Entrepreneurs Outside the Mainstream.Taub was also noted for his teaching and mentoring  inspiring generations of UChicago students. He received the Llewelyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1976  and the Faculty Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching in 2004.“Richard Taub was a fierce critic with a great heart ” said Elisabeth Clemens  the William Rainey Harper Distinguished Service Professor of Sociology and the College at UChicago. “Those traits made him a determined builder. He had an eye for projects with potential that others did not always see; with his combination of intellectual enthusiasm  constant challenge  and friendship  that potential was often realized.”In a message to faculty in the Division of the Social Sciences  Dean Amanda Woodward described Taub as a “master and aficionado” of undergraduate teaching. In honor of his 35 years overseeing the public policy major  the College established the annual Richard P. Taub Lecture and BA Thesis Prize  which is awarded by the Harris School of Public Policy to three undergraduates with outstanding senior theses.“The academic framework of public policy  along with its spirit  continues to reflect his contributions and care ” said Sr. Lect. Jim Leitzel  co-chair of public policy studies in the College. “The ongoing attempt to merge academic rigor with policy relevance and the special attention to social inequality—these are among Richard Taub’s legacies to the public policy major. … We are all Taubians  even if we don’t know it.”Taub also loved graduate teaching and was a dedicated and effective advisor  serving on more than 100 dissertation committees across several departments and schools.“He was witty  eclectic and kind to everyone he met and was a colossal figure on campus and integral to its history ” said Brian Tuohy  PhD’18  now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Anytime we would go for a walk from his office to the sociology department  we would be stopped by dozens of people who wanted to talk to him—from students to administrators to full professors. He was loved and admired by so many.”Taub also held many prestigious administrative appointments over his tenure at the University  including director of the Program for Urban Neighborhoods  associate dean of the College and chair of the Department of Comparative Human Development which he ledfor 12 years.“Richard cared deeply about the welfare of the University as a collegial institution and as a mutually supporting community of friends ” said John W. Boyer  dean of the College. “In his roles as associate dean of the College  and as the very successful director of our public policy program  Richard was a wise counselor and effective administrator  and someone who understood that to protect the mission and identity of the College one needed to be open to structural innovation and intellectual risk-taking.”
                    Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi  pioneering psychologist and ‘father of flow ’ 1934–2021            ,Prof. Emeritus Mihaly “Mike” Csikszentmihalyi  a pioneering University of Chicago psychologist known as the “father of flow ” died Oct. 20 at his home in Claremont  California. He was 87.As a scholar  he is best known for creating flow theory—referring to a state of being in which people become so immersed in the joy of their work or activity “that nothing else seems to matter.” He outlined the theory inFlow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience  a seminal 1990 book that influenced leaders from politics to sports.“Mike had a genius for creating simple  generative models of flow  creativity and aesthetic experience  and then unfolding their implications in his writings; the impact of his ideas has been remarkably broad ” said Jeanne Nakamura  an associate professor at Claremont Graduate University  where Csikszentmihalyi taught after retiring from UChicago in 1999.Csikszentmihalyi’s work was “like a flashlight in a dark tunnel ” said Jennifer A. Schmidt  a former UChicago doctoral student who is now an associate professor at Michigan State University.Often known as Mike C. to friends and colleagues  Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced Chick-SENT-Me-High) once wrote that the best moments in life are not the passive  receptive or relaxing times. By that logic  he undoubtedly counted many great moments in his lifetime  authoring numerous books and holding countless titles—not least among them husband  father and grandfather.“Since his death  so many people have talked about Mike's impact as a person—alongside talking about his impact as a scholar—appreciating his humor  warmth  and generosity ” said Nakamura  co-director of the Claremont Graduate University’sQuality of Life Research Center  which Csikszentmihalyi founded. “He was the best example of the things that he studied about the life well lived.”Csikszentmihalyi was born on Sept. 29  1934  in Fiume  then part of the Kingdom of Italy and now known as Rijeka in Croatia. His father worked at the Hungarian Consulate in Fiume before being appointed the Hungarian ambassador to Italy shortly after World War II. When communists took over Hungary in 1949  the elder Csikszentmihalyi resigned and opened a restaurant in Rome. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi dropped out of school to help support the family.Csikszentmihalyi became curious about happiness after seeing the pain and suffering of Europeans around him during World War II. He found that many were unable to live contentedly after losing their jobs  homes  and general security during the war. The observations led him to become curious about what made life worth living  and he began to explore art  philosophy  and religion as he sought answers.
                    R. Stephen Berry  ‘one of the most influential chemists of his generation ’ 1931-2020            ,R. Stephen Berry  a pioneering University of Chicago scientist who spent his life making fundamental contributions across the fields of chemistry and energy policy  died July 26. He was 89.Berry  the James Franck Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Chemistry and the James Franck Institute  was known as a “Renaissance scientist;” he made both experimental and theoretical discoveries across a wide range of areas within his discipline and beyond. Many of his research themes  including measuring electron affinities  understanding structural transitions in clusters of molecules  and creating the foundations of finite time thermodynamics  are today central pillars of the field. He was also an early pioneer in sustainable energy analysis  inspired by the pollution in 1960s-era Chicago.“Stephen Berry’s work and ideas have greatly influenced the development of chemistry and related areas of science  and have helped shaped our scientific perception ” said Stuart Rice  the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Chemistry and Berry’s colleague and close friend for six decades. “He stands out as being the most original person I have known. He was undoubtably one of the most broad-ranging and influential scientists in the United States  and in the entire scientific world.”Born in 1931 in Denver  Berry recalled an early fascination with science and chemistry; he and his friends scavenged through trash bins for beakers and flasks. He graduated from East High School in 1948  but it was winning a Westinghouse Talent Fellowship that pivoted the course of his life  inspiring him to attend Harvard for his undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry. He received his Ph.D. in 1956 and taught at Harvard and the University of Michigan  then spent four years as an assistant professor at Yale before moving to the University of Chicago in 1964  where he would spend the rest of his life.From the beginning  Berry displayed a talent for seeing connections and exploring questions that would later become key areas of inquiry. “He had a nose for what was interesting ” Rice said. In early work  Berry carried out pioneering measurements of electron affinities—how tightly bound electrons are in atoms and molecules. These numbers became a fundamental part of modern chemistry.He also invented the concept of “pseudorotation ” an odd formation of atoms that is common within some types of molecules  and important for understanding how certain processes in living organisms are carried out.His later work led to the first observation of transient reaction intermediates of radicals  an in-between stage of chemical reactions that had previously eluded chemists. “The impact of that work was tremendously important ” said Donald Levy  the Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Chemistry and Berry’s longtime UChicago colleague. “If you don’t understand these reactions  then you don’t understand some of the most interesting chemistry there is.”Another part of his legacy is central contributions to the understanding of structural transitions in molecular clusters. “Molecules are not frozen entities; electrons and atoms move around  and their motions are correlated ” said Steven Sibener  the Carl William Eisendrath Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry  who worked alongside Berry for many years. “You need this to understand everything from nanoparticles to catalysis to biochemistry. This was an extraordinarily tough problem  and he was a pioneer in realizing and elucidating those motions.”One of Berry’s most seminal contributions was stimulating the development of a field now known as finite time thermodynamics  which helps describe the actions of systems in flux. Classic thermodynamics  which is more than 200 years old  uses a model system with idealized and often unrealistic assumptions; finite time thermodynamics offers a way to analyze motion  heat and power closer to the real world.“When I was in graduate school  no one wanted to study thermodynamics because we thought all the questions had been asked and there was nothing left to be done ” BerrytoldUChicago Newsin 2019. “But my own work in finite time thermodynamics shows how silly and wrong we were. Science doesn’t close  and that’s part of the thrill.”But in the mid-1960s  he would develop another passion: addressing pollution. In those days  Chicago was heated mainly by coal  and the results were everywhere. “Chicago was smoky and smelly  and there’d be a layer of gray dirt on your windshield each morning ” herecalled in an interview last year. He wrote a letter of complaint to Mayor Richard J. Daley  which touched off a lifetime of interest in energy policy and sustainability.Berry and scientist Margaret Fels created one of the first analyses of what came to be called life-cycle analysis—calculating the environmental and energy impact of a product all the way from the mining of its ingredients to how it’s recycled or disposed of. This is now part of the canon of energy policy.
                    Michael Silverstein  groundbreaking anthropologist and linguist  1945-2020            ,Prof. Michael Silverstein  a leading University of Chicago anthropologist who made groundbreaking contributions to linguistic anthropology and helped define the field of sociolinguistics  died July 17 in Chicago following a battle with brain cancer. He was 74.The Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology  Linguistics and Psychology  Silverstein was known for his highly influential research on language-in-use as a social and cultural practice and for his long-term fieldwork on Native language speakers of the Pacific Northwest and of Aboriginal Australia. Most recently  Silverstein examined the effects of globalization  nationalism and other social forces on local speech communities.“Over a half-century at the University of Chicago  he produced a body of work that fundamentally changed the place of linguistics in the field  with foundational contributions to the understanding of language structure  sociolinguistics and semiotics  as well as the history of linguistics and anthropology ” said Prof. Joe Masco  chair of the Department of Anthropology. “His erudition  sense of humor  love of scholarship  of teaching  of conversation and substantive debate is legendary and helped establish the intellectual strength of UChicago in all the many different fields of which he was part.”Born Sept. 12  1945  in Brooklyn  New York  Silverstein earned his bachelor’s degree and doctorate from Harvard University. He was invited by the Department of Anthropology to teach the Language in Culture introductory course in the fall of 1970. He was hired as associate professor with tenure in 1971 and was promoted to professor in 1978.“Language in Culture  which he taught continuously from 1970-2020  offered generations of students in multiple fields—Anthropology  Psychology  Linguistics  Human Development  among others—a Rosetta Stone to interpret a 2 000-year history of ideas about the relationship between language  culture and social interaction ” said Robert Moore  PhD’00  a former student who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. “It inspired numerous books and reshaped the humanistic fields concerned with speech as a form of social action. Students who went on to become philosophers  sociologists  anthropologists and social activists all drew primary inspiration from this course.”A prolific writer of essays  articles and reviews  Silverstein’s books includedWhitney on Language Natural Histories of Discourse(with Greg Urban) Talking PoliticsandCreatures of Politics: Media  Message and the American Presidency(with Michael Lempert). He was active in professional service across UChicago  including as a member of the Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board for Research with Human Subjects from 1997-2000 and 2001-2005. He served as board chair from 2005-2012.In 2019  Silverstein gave theNora and Edward Ryerson Lecture—a recognition of his lasting contribution to the intellectual life of the University of Chicago.“What he strove to understand  and what he clarified in groundbreaking ways  was a systematic way to understand what fundamentally makes human societies function: communication in all its guises ” said Assoc. Prof. Constantine Nakassis. “He did so with incisive observation  brilliant analysis and with his unique wit. His ideas are  quite literally  the very language through which the social study of discourse is thought.“But what I will remember most of Michael was how generous he was. He built worlds—institutional worlds  scholarly worlds  intellectual worlds—and he invited you to participate in them  grow them  and make them your own. In doing so  he lifted us up.”He served on the editorial boards ofAmerican Anthropologist Law and Social Inquiry Ethnos Functions of Languageand theJournal of Linguistic Anthropologyamong others. Silverstein was also a member of seven professional societies  including serving as the founding vice president and then president of the Society of Linguistic Anthropology.Silverstein was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1982. He held a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1979  was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991  and to the American Philosophical Society in 2008. In 2016  he was interviewed for APS’s “Talking About Things” series  discussing one of the journals of explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. In 2014  he received the Franz Boas Award for Exemplary Service to Anthropology; in giving him its highest award  the American Anthropology Association described Silverstein as “a virtual force of nature in the discipline.”
                    Richard Miller  pioneer of computational astrophysics  1926–2020            ,Prof. Emeritus Richard “Dick” H. Miller  a longtime University of Chicago astrophysicist and pioneer in simulating how galaxies are born and evolve  died March 7 in Chicago. He was 93.During a career that spanned more than 50 years at the University of Chicago  Miller  PhD’57  extended the possibilities of computer programming and technology to the sciences. He founded the Committee on Information Sciences in 1965  placing the University at the forefront of the 20th-century revolution in computing and information processing. He pioneered a technique for creating motion pictures that depicted the evolution of galaxy structures  ushering in the era of modern computational astrophysics. Among other findings  his techniques revised our understanding of the shape of elliptical galaxies.“Prof. Miller’s work brought us into an era of computational astrophysics. What he explored using early computers and particle detectors  he wouldn’t brag about it  but it changed astrophysics ” said Prof. John Carlstrom  chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. “We are grateful for his lifetime of contributions to astrophysics and to the department.”Miller was born in Plano  Illinois in 1926  and he entered the University of Chicago as part of the President Robert Hutchins’ program for young high school students. He studied for one year before enlisting in the Navy and fighting in the Pacific Theater. The V-12 Navy College Training Program provided him with an education at Iowa State College in Ames  from which he graduated in two years  at age 19  with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. Out of gratitude  he decided to spend a year at sea completing his Navy duties with the rank of ensign.
                    Alfred T. Anderson  scientist who studied rocks to recreate volcanic eruptions  1937-2020            ,An exhibit at the University of Chicago Library this winter contains a wooden baseball bat worn flat on one side  next to a bag of rocks collected from the slopes of a Japanese volcano. The bat belonged to UChicago geoscientist Prof. Alfred T. Anderson  Jr.“Fred found that was the perfect tool for smashing rock samples ” said his colleague Prof. Andy Davis. “Just enough weight to crush the pumice without damaging the pieces of quartz inside.”Anderson  a professor in the Department of Geophysical Sciences for nearly 40 years  also used the latest state-of-the-art scientific instruments for his work on understanding volcanic eruptions. But he also had a practical streak  Davis said. “Sometimes a baseball bat and a cardboard ice cream container are exactly what you need.”Anderson  who died Jan. 15  made pioneering contributions to the field of volcanology—particularly how to reconstruct long-ago volcanic explosions using clues in the rocks left behind. He was 82.Born on Long Island  New York in 1937  Anderson spent his early years spending hours skipping stones at the beach. The fascination with rocks grew into a passion for geology  which he pursued at Northwestern and Princeton universities  and then with the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1968 he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago  where he would spend the next four decades.Anderson’s work focused on a kind of glass that is often found embedded in volcanic stone from past eruptions. “His theory  and he was very alone in this at first  was that the dissolved gases in these inclusions were fundamental to understanding the conditions before and after the eruption ” said Davis  who worked alongside Anderson for many years and co-authored several papers with him.There are many different ways for volcanoes to erupt  and scientists wanted to be able to tell what had happened in past eruptions: how the magma moved  how much gas was released  how far the lava traveled aboveground. Anderson’s argument was that each glass inclusion recorded a snapshot from the moment it was created over the course of the eruption.Especially as the technology to extract and learn from such gases grew  Anderson’s studies “sparked a revolution in melt inclusion studies of volcanic rocks ” according to Charles Bacon with the U.S. Geological Survey  who presented Anderson with the Bowen Award in 2001  a prestigious honor in geology. “Nature has given us precious few tools with which to look backward in time in the reconstruction of geological processes. A special genius is often required to recognize one of those tools ” he said.Anderson was known for the rigor and precision of his science. “He has led the field of melt inclusion research because he has noticed things  measured them and extracted information about processes others would have missed ” Bacon wrote.His methods are now standard in the field.He traveled widely to collect his samples  including volcanoes in Iceland  Hawaii  Japan  Alaska and particularly California  where he reconstructed the eruption that formed the Bishop Tuff  east of Yosemite National Park  700 000 years ago. “It’s really important to be able to reconstruct these pieces of history  because this was unlike anything we’ve seen in recorded history ” Davis said. “Mount St. Helens was small compared to this volcano.”Closer to home  Anderson was known for his willingness to take anyone who asked on a tour of the geology of the rock on the façades of buildings in downtown Chicago. For years  he and his wife also served as the resident masters for the Snell-Hitchcock residence hall.He was also an enthusiastic athlete  playing baseball with his two sons and taking them hiking and camping; for many years  the family traveled with UChicago students on summer field trips to collect rocks on the slopes of Mount Shasta.Anderson is survived by his sister Almeda  wife Caroline  sons Eric (Sinane) and Doug (Colette)  as well as grandchildren Payton  Quincy  Gisele and Sonia.
                    Stanley M. Freehling  trustee emeritus and Chicago arts patron  1924-2019            ,Trustee Emeritus Stanley M. Freehling  an investment banker and revered patron of the arts in Chicago  died Sept. 20. He was 95 years old.Freehling served on the University of Chicago Board of Trustees from 1983 to 1989 and as a trustee emeritus from 1989 until his death. He served as a life member of the Smart Museum Board of Governors and a member of the Court Theatre Board of Trustees as well as a member of the Division of the Humanities Visiting Committee and a life member of the Art History Visiting Committee.Freehling had a distinguished career in business  serving for decades as a senior partner at Freehling and Company. He was committed to civic life in Chicago  particularly in the arts  known as the city’s “patron saint of the arts” and “the third lion” of the Art Institute of Chicago  in reference to the famed lions at the museum’s entrance.Freehling raised millions of dollars for institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago and Ravinia Festival and played a significant role in the success of these two organizations  among many others. In 1985  U.S. President Ronald Reagan appointed Freehling to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.Freehling served as founding chairman of the Goodman Theatre/Chicago Theater Group  a life trustee of the Board of the Art Institute of Chicago  and president of the Arts Club of Chicago. He also served as an emeritus trustee of Northwestern Memorial Hospital  the Shedd Aquarium  Ravinia Festival  the Chicago Public Library Foundation and The Cradle.A Chicago native  Freehling was born in the city’s Hyde Park neighborhood  attended the University of Chicago and received his bachelor’s degree from Stockholm University in 1947.Freehling is survived by three children  Maggie  Debbie and Robert; as well as five grandchildren and a great grandchild. He was predeceased by his two brothers  Julius and Herbert; and his wife of 64 years  Joan Freehling  who died in 2011. In keeping with UChicago board tradition  a memorial resolution in honor of Freehling will be presented at the board meeting in November.
                    Shinya Inoué  pioneer in microscopy and imaging live cells  1921-2019            ,Shinya Inoué  an extraordinary innovator in microscopy and live-cell imaging  died Sept. 30 in Falmouth  Massachusetts at age 98.A pioneering scientific leader and mentor for more than half a century at the University of Chicago-affiliatedMarine Biological Laboratory  Inoué introduced the era of live-cell imaging by using polarized light microscopy to explore the intricacies of cellular structure and dynamics.Inoue’s dual careers as a microscopist and cell biophysicist were elegantly complementary: Each refinement of his hand-built microscopes led to a clearer understanding of fundamental life processes  including cell division  fertilization and early embryonic development. Inoué was also the co-inventor of video microscopy  a revolutionary advance that ushered in the modern era of imaging.“We have a lost a giant in cell biology and a wonderful human being ” said colleague Ron Vale of the University of California  San Francisco. “Shinya was the pioneer in studying the dynamics of living cells by microscopy  an approach that is widespread today. He developed many new methods in microscopy  and his observations led to many unique insights in the working of cells. Shinya left behind a lasting legacy of contributions in cell biology. He will be widely missed.”Inoué’s far-reaching impact at the Marine Biological Laboratory began in the 1950s when he was a visiting investigator from Princeton University and continued after he joined the lab as a senior scientist in 1982. In his time in Woods Hole  he founded an international  collaborative center for innovation in light microscopy and pioneered a course format  now standard in the field  that provides a fertile ground for beneficial interactions between the microscopy industry and the academic research community.“For the last 30 years  I had the great fortune to work with Shinya Inoué  who was an exacting and demanding  yet patient and always generous mentor  who taught by example  combining a passion both for creating tools and applying them to reveal the mysteries of life ” said MBL senior scientist Rudolf Oldenbourg. “Inoué not only was an outstanding scientist  but he is universally respected for his kind and thoughtful ways  for his humanity  and his attention to personal relationships.”The son of a Japanese diplomat  Inoué was born in 1921 in London  England. His distinguished career began in the 1940s at Tokyo University  where as an undergraduate he studied with cell biologist and MBL summer investigator Katsuma Dan. Dan presented Inoué with a challenge: Build a microscope that will allow us to see the mitotic spindle—the transient structure that moves chromosomes in the dividing cell—in a living sea-urchin egg. While scientists had seen them in dissected cells  they had never been able to watch it happen live. Inoué eventually built his first polarized light microscope out of various found parts—including a discarded machine-gun base and a tin tea can—in 1947  in the aftermath of World War II.Inoué entered Princeton University in 1948 and improved his polarized light microscope (now nicknamed the “Shinya Scope”). In 1951 he used it to prove the universal existence of the spindle fibers  the dynamic protein filaments that move chromosomes in the dividing cell. Inoué announced this landmark discovery in the MBL’s Lillie Auditorium  where he premiered a movie of dividing cells that clearly showed the action of the spindle fibers in the mitotic spindle. It was the first major accomplishment in a career devoted to delving into the mysteries of living cells.Shortly after joining the MBL in 1982  Inoué and Robert and Nina Allen independently discovered at the MBL that using a video camera to record images from a microscope brought great gains in image clarity. Inoué combined video microscopy with computer-assisted contrast enhancement  allowing one to see fine details of cells that had never been seen before. It was the birth of the electronic era in microscopy.Over five decades  Inoué built seven generations of his Shinya Scope  with technical improvements each time  and in the late 1990s he invented the centrifuge polarizing microscope. Inoué held four U.S. patents for his microscopes and authored more than 100 scientific papers  many of which are collected inThe Collected Works of Shinya Inoue: Microscopes  Living Cells  and Dynamic Molecules(2008) He also authored the bookVideo Microscopy(1986).Inoué was named a Distinguished Scientist at MBL  the laboratory’s highest honor  in 1986. Inoué was the recipient of numerous other awards and honors. They include the Order of the Sacred Treasure  Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon Award from the Government of Japan; the International Prize for Biology from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Microscopy Society of America; and the E.B. Wilson Award from the American Society for Cell Biology.He is survived by his wife  Sylvia (McCandless) Inoué  five children  six grandchildren  and one great-grandchild.—Adapted from a story that first appeared on the Marine Biological Laboratory website.
                    Mary Jean Mulvaney  pioneering figure in college athletics  1927-2019            ,Prof. Emerita Mary Jean Mulvaney  one of the first women to lead a coeducational athletic department in the United States  died Sept. 20 at the age of 92.A beloved and pioneering figure in the University of Chicago’s rich athletic history  Mulvaney served the department for 24 years  retiring in 1990 as director of athletics. Joining UChicago in 1966 to chair the women’s physical education division  she assumed lead of a consolidated men’s and women’s athletic department in 1976.A stalwart champion for UChicago Athletics  Mulvaney nurtured the growth of the women’s varsity program and presided over its move to NCAA competition in 1981. During her tenure  the University increased its women’s sports offerings from two to nine. UChicago now sponsors 20 varsity sports—10 women  10 men—that compete within NCAA Division III.“Mary Jean will live on in all of the Maroons that felt her generous spirit and knew her genuine kindness ” said Erin McDermott  UChicago’s director of Athletics & Recreation. “A true pioneer  she helped pave the way for women leaders in college athletics through her courage and compassion. She will always be a beacon of light for UChicago Athletics. I am grateful to have been in her presence and honored to follow in her footsteps.”Mulvaney held the titles of associate professor and professor of physical education at UChicago.Mulvaney was inducted into the UChicago Athletics Hall of Fame in 2003. In addition  the University honored her with the Mary Jean Mulvaney Scholar-Athlete Award  given annually since 1990 to a male and female senior with the highest GPA.Also active on the national level  she was inducted into the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Hall of Fame shortly after her retirement. In 2006  she received a lifetime achievement award from the National Association of Collegiate Women Athletic Administrators  now known as Women Leaders in College Sports.Mulvaney was one of the driving forces behind the formation of the University Athletic Association  created in 1986 as a league comprised of private research institutions in major metropolitan areas who are committed to the NCAA Division III philosophy. Her active involvement in the UAA included roles as secretary and chair of the Athletic Administrators’ Committee  as well as member of the executive committee.She ultimately received the UAA Founders Medal  and was recognized for her contributions in 2012 during the conference’s silver anniversary celebration.
                    William Meadow  pioneer in neonatal intensive care and medical ethics  1948-2019            ,Prof. William L. Meadow  a leading authority on the care of infants born prematurely or with significant health concerns  died Sept. 14 at the age of 70  after battling leukemia for four years.Meadow  along with clinical medical ethics colleagues Mark Siegler and John Lantos  was a pioneer in the development of neonatal bioethics—the complex set of medical and personal calculations that guide decision making for parents  physicians and nurses who care for infants born too soon or with significant congenital problems or infections.“Bill was a teacher in everything that he did ” said Lantos  now at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. “He was absolutely committed to students and education  as well as to his patients. He was the only doctor I have ever met who made rounds on each of his patients twice a day  then came back in the evening to make rounds again.”In their 2006 book Neonatal Bioethics: The Moral Challenges of Medical Innovation  Meadow and Lantos also helped change the way neonatologists weighed the decision to withdraw life support. Before their work  most neonatal authorities tended to focus on what Lantos called the “moment of highest uncertainty.” Meadow gradually convinced neonatologists to be more patient  to wait an extra day or two. “This led to much more accurate prognostication ” Lantos explained. “People caught on.”“Bill would also  once a year  spend a full day as a nurse  with appropriate guidance ” Lantos said. He insisted this was the only way a doctor can know how challenging nursing can be. The NICU nurses “teased him  and questioned his efficiency ” Lantos said  “but they admired and appreciated the effort.”Meadow retired from clinical work but remained an active member of the section of neonatology. He joined the UChicago faculty as an assistant professor in 1981  was promoted to associate professor in 1987 and then full professor of pediatrics in 2001. He took over the neonatology fellowship program in 2003 and was co-director of neonatology from 2005 to 2014.Meadow lectured extensively throughout North America and Europe on medical and neonatal ethics. He published more than 90 academic papers and 48 book chapters on neonatology and medical ethics  as well as more than 200 scholarly abstracts.“Bill Meadow impacted more people’s lives than anyone I’ve ever met ” said colleague Michael Schreiber  a UChicago neonatologist. He said one of Meadow’s strengths was “to show us how to develop a work-life balance. He had a difficult job  but he somehow found the time to make it home for dinner with the family and to coach his kids. He inspired us to do the same.”A unique approach to his patientsMeadow’s standard greeting for faculty  staff and patient families was “Welcome to the NICU. You’re going to love it here.” It was merely an icebreaker  but how Meadow introduced the neonatal intensive care unit to new faculty  residents and medical students  as well as the parents of patients in need.Many new residents were not prepared for his unique approach to the NICU. Intensive care units “can be grumpy places ” Lantos explained  “but Bill found ways to lighten the mood  like singing on rounds. He made people  especially parents  feel a little more comfortable.”“Everybody thinks of the NICU as a vast majority of severely premature babies ” Lantos said. These often very tiny babies “may be premature ” he continued  but “the vast majority of these children go home and do fine.”“He was also a huge family man ” said his wife Susan Goldin-Meadow  a professor in UChicago’s Department of Psychology. “That was really important to him. He made time despite a doctor’s schedule. He was extraordinarily generous with his family  and his colleagues really enjoyed working with him.“But he was also a dedicated physician. He never complained. When the urgent calls came  when his leadership was necessary for the care for a sick child  he got up and went in. He just did it. He enjoyed doing that. He somehow relished odd schedules.”He was a “wonderful  charming man and a surrogate father to much of Hyde Park and the University community ” she added. “He could be gruff  when needed  but he was loved. He was a great husband.”The Meadows have three children who prefer to go by their nicknames: Xander  a senior database engineer  is married to Jessica Kumar  and they have two children  Cody and Zia; Shmug is training to become an internal medicine resident at Loyola University; Beanie is training at Lurie Children’s Hospital to become a neonatologist.A funeral service already was held. In lieu of flowers  contributions in memory of Dr. Meadow may be sent to the University of Chicago Medical Center at 5235 S. Harper Court  4th Floor  Chicago  IL 60615.—Story first appeared on the UChicago Medicine website.
                    David Bevington  preeminent Shakespeare scholar  1931–2019            ,Prof. Emeritus David Bevington  the extraordinarily prolific editor of Shakespeare’s full canon and author of seminal books about English Renaissance playwrights  died peacefully at home in Chicago on Aug. 2. He was 88 years old.Remembered by friends and family as a vibrant  generous and intellectually inquisitive man  the longtime University of Chicago professor possessed an infectious enthusiasm for the works he taught. He lived life with boundless energy—teaching  writing  hosting social events and playing chamber music with friends until just before he died.As a scholar  Bevington helped build UChicago’s Department of English Language and Literature into a national center for graduate study in the English Renaissance.“David was a great editor of Shakespeare’s plays both for scholars and for more general audiences ” said Prof. Emeritus Richard Strier. “He had infinite patience and sweated out the details of language and punctuation  writing careful notes to clarify knotty texts for readers.”Prof. Joshua Scodel praised Bevington’s “combination of historical erudition  deep engagement with Renaissance stagecraft  and profound insights into the human condition.” He cited three of Bevington’s many books:From “Mankind” to Marlowe(1962)  a classic study of the transition from Medieval to Renaissance Drama;Tudor Drama and Politics(1968) a pioneering analysis of the historical topicality of Tudor plays; andAction Is Eloquence(1984)  a wide-ranging treatment of gesture and the visual aspects of Shakespearean drama.“David bridged the gap between the historicist analysis of Shakespeare and the critical appreciation of his abiding relevance to contemporary audiences ” Scodel said.
                    Vivian Gussin Paley  renowned early education researcher and Laboratory Schools teacher  1929–2019            ,Vivian Gussin Paley was a keen observer of young children  defining in her work a key tenet of how they should negotiate relationships in class and on the playground—that no child should tell another: “You can’t play with us.”A renowned educator and researcher of early childhood education who spent most of her career at theUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools  Paley died July 26 at the age of 90.Paley  PhB’47  who spent most of her nearly four decades teaching at Lab  wrote 13 books about children based on her experiences in the classroom. Paley was Lab’s most prominent example of teachers who contribute to academic scholarship in the area of education.In 1989 Paleyreceived a prestigious MacArthur Fellowshipin recognition of her special contributions to education  which included developing a “story playing” technique that helps teachers understand how children’s natural interest in fantasy can be used to help them learn. Stories  which students can tell or act out  play a central role in children’s growth  she contended. In particular  Paley was interested in issues of fairness and the ways in which students understand the concept.Among themselves  children tell and act out fantasies to describe their feelings and ideas  she wrote. ”We call it play. But it forms the primary culture in the classroom. Fantasy and storytelling are the abstract thinking of the young  carrying a deeper sense of reality than could any form of adult thoughts ” she explained.
                    Timuel Black  civil rights leader and Chicago historian  1918–2021            ,Timuel Black  beloved Chicago historian  civil rights activist and University of Chicago alum  died Oct. 13 at his Hyde Park home. He was 102.Black  AM’54  is being remembered by the University community and across Chicago for his extraordinary life and career: He marched with Martin Luther King Jr.  campaigned for Chicago mayor Harold Washington  mentored a young Barack Obama and helped bring the Obama Presidential Center to the South Side.“Like many others in the University of Chicago community  I was privileged to know Timuel Black ” said Chancellor Robert J. Zimmer. “He was a devoted student and teacher of the history of the South Side  and he lived that history over a remarkable span of 102 years  during which he helped to bring about profound changes. We are grateful for the wisdom that is his enduring gift to the city he loved  and I am personally grateful for our friendship over many years.”As a speaker  educator and writer  Black captivated audiences in the classroom and across the city for decades. He interviewed hundreds of Chicago residents for his oral history Bridges of Memory; authored a memoir Sacred Ground; and regularly gave tours and lectures about his life and career.In 2012 the University of Chicago awarded Blackthe William Benton Medal for Distinguished Public Service  honoring him as “one of the most influential civil rights leaders in Chicago history” and “a national voice in the cause of American justice.”“Timuel Black dedicated his life to helping communities across Chicago  especially on the South Side ” said Derek Douglas  vice president for civic engagement and external affairs at UChicago. “His unparalleled understanding of the area’s history and people made him an outstanding advocate  a trusted counselor and a consummate community partner. He was deeply committed to educating and inspiring young people—a mission that he advanced with the University of Chicago through the creation of theTimuel D. Black Community Solidarity Scholarship.“Tim was one of the most passionate community leaders of the effort to bring the Obama Presidential Center to the South Side  and his vision was central to that proposal’s success. Even as we mourn his loss  we know his humanitarian spirit will continue to guide us in working toward a bright future for the South Side and beyond.”
                    John Paul Stevens  Supreme Court justice and UChicago alum  1920-2019            ,John Paul Stevens  a long-serving Supreme Court justice who traced his preparation as a lawyer to the University of Chicago  died Tuesday. He was 99.A Hyde Park native  Stevens  AB’41  attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools from kindergarten through high school  walking just a few blocks from his family’s home near the corner of 57th Street and Kenwood Avenue. He then enrolled in the undergraduate College  studying English literature and graduating Phi Beta Kappa.Nominated in 1975 by President Gerald Ford and confirmed unanimously  Stevens joined the Supreme Court with a reputation as a moderate conservative. His nomination was recommended to Ford by then-U.S. Attorney General Edward Levi  who had served as president of the University and dean of the University of Chicago Law School.Stevens served on the Supreme Court for more than 34 years  leaving in 2010 with the third-longest tenure behind his predecessor William O. Douglas and 19th-century justice Stephen Field. At 90  Stevens also retired as the second-oldest justice to serve on the nation’s highest court  behind Oliver Wendell Holmes.
                    Clemens C.J. Roothaan  eminent quantum chemist and concentration camp survivor  1918-2019            ,Clemens C.J. Roothaan was in a Nazi concentration camp when he made his first theoretical quantum calculations—work that later would be accepted as his master’s thesis in physics.After the war  he pursued his PhD at the University of Chicago  where he became a professor who created groundbreaking models of the electronic structure of molecules that are still used today.Roothaan  the Louis Block Professor Emeritus of Physics and Chemistry  died June 17 at age 100.“Clemens was a foundational figure in the field of quantum chemistry ” said R. Stephen Berry  the James Franck Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Chemistry  who was Roothaan’s UChicago colleague for decades. “In my mind  he is probably the person who most deserved but never received the Nobel Prize.”“He was a pioneer in the development and application of rigorous theory to the electronic structure of atoms and molecules ” said Paul Bagus  PhD’66  a professor of chemistry at the University of North Texas and a former student of Roothaan’s. “He was a true giant in our discipline.”Born Clemens Carel Johannes Roothaan in Nijmegen in the Netherlands in 1918  Roothaan was studying physics at university when World War II broke out. As a Catholic citizen  he was temporarily allowed to continue studying  but his brother Vic become involved with the Dutch Resistance  and one night  the Nazis came to the house looking for him. They didn’t find Vic  but took Roothaan and his younger brother Jan instead. Both were interned in the Vught concentration camp near ’s-Hertogenbosch in occupied Holland.The nearby electronics giant Philips N.V.  occupied by the Nazis  tapped the camp for labor. A small group of prisoners with scientific backgrounds were drafted for academic work; his former professors  still at the Delft Institute of Technology  worked with Philips and were able to suggest problems for Roothaan to work on to continue his physics education.As the tide of the war began to turn  however  the prisoners were moved to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany  where conditions were much harsher. As the Allies approached in 1945  his brother Jan was sent to Bergen-Belsen  where he died of typhus; Roothaan was sent on a death march to the Baltic Sea  from which he was rescued by incoming American troops.Roothaan emigrated to the U.S. on a Guggenheim fellowship to continue his studies at the University of Chicago  where he received his PhD in 1950 and became a professor in 1952.At UChicago he worked closely with Robert Mulliken  a physicist and chemist who would receive the Nobel Prize for his work in 1966. Mulliken was investigating how electrons behave within the orbitals of molecules  which determines how chemicals behave. Scientists encountering these problems in the 1930s found them far too complex to do by hand. But as digital computing began to blossom in the 1950s and ‘60s  Roothaan demonstrated a nearly preternatural talent for translating these mathematics into computation.Puzzling over the organization of molecular orbital calculations  Roothaan went with a group of friends  including his future wife  to an open-air concert by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in Ravinia Park. “Lying in the grass  listening to the music and looking at the stars ” he later recounted  “it suddenly flashed through my head that standard MO theory did not start with the right question.”From this insight Roothaan developed a fundamental model for how to compute the structures of atoms and molecules which became the standard for the field. “Refinements have been made  but his is still the central fundamental starting point of how you model atomic structures ” Berry said.Roothaan wrote a seminalpaper on the subjectfor theReviews of Modern Physics which was consistently listed among the journal’s most cited papers (it continues to be cited today  nearly 70 years later). “That paper was the one that everybody who ever wanted to do any work in that field had to read and master ” Berry said. The result became known as the Roothaan equations.For decades  he and Mulliken also ran the Laboratory of Molecular Structure and Spectra  which helped define and shape the field of electronic structure theory and and trained a generation of scientists in the discipline.Natural intuition for computationHungry for more computational power  Roothaan worked with early computers at UChicago-affiliated Argonne National Laboratory and then played a significant role in developing the University’s first computer program. He served as director of its Computation Center from 1962 to 1968  helping scientists from other fields use the computer while developing hardware and software for large-scale scientific calculations.Berry said few people in the field could match Roothaan’s intuition for programming. “These could be enormously huge computations sometimes  and he could just sit down and write out how to do it ” he said.After retiring from UChicago in 1988  he worked for Hewlett-Packard  where he developed the mathematical co-processor routines for the Itanium chip and served as a liaison for the computing needs of the Large Hadron Collider in Europe.
                    Kenneth Northcott  UChicago scholar  translator and actor  1922–2019            ,Prof. Emeritus Kenneth Northcott lived a vibrant existence  which was often filled with drama—in the classroom  on the stage  and in the British Intelligence Corps after World War II.A renowned University of Chicago scholar of Germanic studies  actor and translator of significant authors  Northcott passed away June 4 in Chicago at age 96.“Northcott stood out for his brilliance as a teacher  translator and actor and for his warmth and outgoing personality ” said Françoise Meltzer  the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature  the Divinity School and the College. “His translations from German to English of important writers such as Thomas Bernhard  Friedrich Dürrenmatt and Siegfried Unseld are an immensely significant contribution to the humanities and scholarship.”His inspired translations of Thomas Bernhard’sThe Voice Imitator(1997) Walking(2003  2015) Three Novellas(2003) andHistrionics: Three Plays(1990) remain in print. “Kenneth was always the first translator we approached when considering a work in German ” recalled Alan Thomas  editorial director of the UChicago Press. “Although he was a medievalist by training and translated several specialized studies for us  Kenneth’s greatest achievement was his brilliant translations of the 20th-century writer Thomas Bernhard. Kenneth’s linguistic resourcefulness  sly humor and experience with the theater made him a perfect match for Bernhard.”For 28 years  Northcott taught medieval German scholarship to UChicago students. “I know his expertise in both Old German and Middle High German won him international respect ” said colleague Bernard McGinn  the Naomi Shenstone Donnelley Professor Emeritus in the Divinity School. “He was particularly interested in Middle High German poetry  especially of the Minnesingers  the lyric poets of the 12th and 13th centuries. Kenneth was extremely generous with his time and sharing his knowledge with students because I sent him several students from the Divinity School who needed to get basic knowledge of High Middle German for their dissertations.”As an actor and occasional director  Northcott had roles in plays at diverse venues  including the Court Theatre  University Theatre  Hull House  Pegasus Players  National Radio Theatre  Wisdom Bridge  City Lit  Chicago Theatre on the Air and NBC TV. Like the late Nicholas Rudall  who directed him in several plays at Court Theatre  Northcott lived as a scholar by day and an actor by night.“I first saw Kenneth when I was in high school in a TV production of Harold Pinter’sThe Dumb Waiter ” Meltzer said. “The play only has two actors  and Kenneth made a profound impression on me. I never imagined that he would later become my close friend.”‘A shoo-in as an interrogator’Northcott was born Nov. 25  1922  in London. At the age of 12  he won a scholarship to Christ’s Hospital School  which advanced him on the path toward becoming a professor. During World War II  Northcott served in the British Army’s Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers from 1942 to 1945 and later in Germany as an interrogator in the Intelligence Corps from 1945 to 1946.“Kenneth was a shoo-in as an interrogator because he spoke fluent German and French—there were plenty of French collaborators to deal with ” said his wife  Patricia John Northcott. “He interrogated lower-level people suspected of war crimes—mostly crimes against Jews. The methods he used were much more timid than the ones favored by the U.S. military today. The stick was using bright lights and waking suspects up at 3 a.m. and marching them around the compound. The carrot was cigarettes.”After the war  Northcott earned his bachelor’s degree in 1950 and master’s degree in 1952 from King’s College  University of London. Following teaching positions at the University of Glasgow and University of Sheffield  he arrived at the University of Chicago  first as a visiting assistant professor in 1958 before permanently joining the faculty in 1961. During his tenure  Northcott held varied administrative positions  including the dean of students in the Division of the Humanities  resident-master of Pierce Hall  and three terms as chair of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures.
                    Olaf Schneewind  world-renowned authority on infectious diseases  1961-2019            ,Prof. Olaf Schneewind  one of the world’s leading authorities on the pathogenic bacteria that cause human disease  died May 26 after a long battle with cancer. He was 57 years old.The Louis Block Professor and chair of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Chicago  Schneewind was a renowned expert on the pathogensStaphylococcus aureus Bacillus anthracis(anthrax) andYersinia pestis(the black plague)—and the mechanisms and strategies that enable them. Schneewind’s laboratory produced more than 250 peer-reviewed publications on the topic.He had been working for 15 years on a vaccine that could neutralize the scourge ofStaphylococcus aureus  including antibiotic-resistant strains. He often reminded students and colleagues  “Staphylococcus aureusis the infectious disease agent that causes the most morbidity and mortality in the 21st century in the United States.”Schneewind was highly respected by his colleagues in the United States and abroad.“I admired and respected the quality of his science as well as the practical  honest and straightforward way in which he approached problems ” said Kenneth Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division at the University of Chicago. “His outstanding scientific discoveries leave a significant impact on the field.”One of Schneewind’s major accomplishments was his central role in the discovery of bacterial sortases. These enzymes help assemble proteins in specific bacteria and anchor these surface proteins to the cell wall. Sortases enable bacteria to adhere to other bacterial or animal cells. Without sortases and their surface protein substrates  bacteria such asStaphylococcus aureuscannot cause disease or interact with their environment.The activity of the sortase enzyme was discovered in the early 1990s by Schneewind and coworkers before the gene coding for the enzyme was identified. By understanding sortase activity  Schneewind and colleagues (including his scientific collaborator and wife  Prof. Dominique Missiakas) were able to identify the surface proteins of other bacterial pathogens based on genome sequences and to study these molecules for their contributions to disease establishment as well as for vaccine development. These insights allowed the team to learn how these bacteria evade detection by the immune system.
                    Thomas Nagylaki  geneticist and ‘quintessential’ UChicagoan  1944-2019            ,A trained physicist  Prof. Emeritus Thomas Nagylaki shifted his focus to medical genetics shortly before joining the University of Chicago in 1975 but always remained interested in mathematics. And for more than 30 years on the UChicago faculty  Nagylaki “awed” many of his colleagues with his prolific scientific work  which stretched well past his retirement.Nagylaki  a renowned scholar who worked to understand the genetic structure and evolution of natural populations  died Feb. 10 at the age of 75.“It was fascinating to be around Tom ” said Martin Kreitman  professor of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. “In terms of sheer intellectual computing power  I’ve never run across anyone like him. He was drawn to theoretical projects that were difficult to prove  but he solved them with subtlety and creativity. His writing was exquisitely precise.”Nagylaki  professor emeritus in the Department of Ecology and Evolution and a member of the Committee on Genetics  Genomics & Systems Biology  may have been best known for his early work on theoretical population genetics  but according to his friend and colleague  Reinhart Burger  a mathematician at the University of Vienna  he also produced “subtle and beautiful new results over the past 10 years.”“He was a unique intellect and a quintessential University of Chicago professor ” Burger added. “He will be sorely missed.”“Tom was a very rigorous scientist and a valued colleague ” said Chung-I Wu  former chairman of Ecology and Evolution at the University. “He could spot the flaws  the logical gaps in your research plan. Then he would push it to the limit. He generally had the last word on any subject.”At the same time  “he was brutally honest ” Wu added. “Sometimes he ruffled feathers. Several students  and probably some of the faculty  may have been intimidated by his intellect. But there was seldom  if ever  a gap in his reasoning. Once you got to understand and accept his style  he could be really helpful. He criticized but also authenticated other people’s work. When you heard encouragement from him ” Wu said  “you knew you were safe.”Thomas Andrew Nagylaki was born Jan. 29  1944 in Budapest  Hungary. His father was killed in World War II. In 1957  his family escaped from Hungary  passed through Switzerland  then moved to Canada. He graduated from McGill University in 1964 with first-class honors in physics  then completed his physics PhD in 1969 at the California Institute of Technology. After graduate school  Nagylaki worked as a research associate for two years at the University of Colorado  followed by a visiting assistant professor role at Oregon State University.His first eight published papers were all about physics. In 1972  however  he switched fields  shifting his focus from physics to medical genetics  but preserving the mathematical component. He worked closely for three years with a pioneer in the field  James F. Crow  the chair of the departments of Genetics and Medical Genetics at the University of Wisconsin  Madison. Nagylaki was a project associate in the Crow laboratory and an assistant scientist in medical genetics.In 1975  Nagylaki moved to the University of Chicago. He rose from assistant professor of Biophysics and Theoretical Biology  to associate professor in 1977  to professor of in 1983. In 1984  he changed departments  joining Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology. In 1989  he moved again  into the department of Ecology and Evolution  which became his academic home for nearly 20 years.He authored two biomathematics textbooks that were designed to appeal to advanced college students with a gift for mathematics. The first Selection in One- and Two-Locus Systems  published in 1977  was based on one of his courses at the University of Chicago. “The only prerequisites ” he noted  “were calculus and matrices.”His second textbook  published in 1992  was an introduction toTheoretical Population Genetics. It covered “areas of theoretical population genetics that can be investigated rigorously by elementary mathematical methods.”Nagylaki also took on various editorial positions. Between 1976 and 1987 he served as an editor  member of the editorial board  or member of the advisory board for three scientific journals—two that focused on mathematics and one devoted to biology. He also served on the National Research Council’s Committee on DNA Forensic Science from 1994 to 1996.He took emeritus status in 2008  but remained active. He authored a total of 122 academic papers  including 12 published after his formal retirement.His colleagues are waiting for one more highly anticipated paper that is now in the queue. “He spent two years working on it ” according to Kreitman. “He told me he had 600 pages of notes.” Nagylaki’s final manuscript—“Not my worst ” he jokingly told colleagues—has been submitted.—This story was adapted from a story that first appeared onThe Forefront.
                    Miguel Civil  world’s leading scholar of ancient Sumerian  1926-2019            ,Miguel Civil  the world’s leading expert in the earliest known written language  died on Jan. 13 at age 92. The scholar at the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute was described as understanding Sumerian better than anyone since the beginning of the second millennium B.C.The ancient Sumerians invented writing  producing hundreds of thousands of clay tablets representing a complicated cuneiform writing system  which recorded everything from religious hymns to how to grow date palms. But roughly 4 000 years ago  the great ancient civilization disappeared  and the language died with it.When Civil arrived at the Oriental Institute in 1963  scholars still struggled with interpreting many basic aspects of the language’s grammar  lexicon and literature. Civil possessed an intuition for Sumerian that was almost magical  colleagues said; the young Catalan professor would spend the next four decades revolutionizing our understanding of ancient Sumerian life  literature  grammar and socioeconomics.“Miguel’s academic contributions are simply monumental ” said Chris Woods  director of the Oriental Institute and fellow Sumerologist. “More than any other scholar  he shaped the modern study of Sumerology.”
                    Frank E. Reynolds  leading scholar of Buddhism and revered teacher  1930-2019            ,Those who knew Prof. Emeritus Frank E. Reynolds have described him as an institution at theUniversity of Chicago Divinity School  inspiring a generation of students while shaping understanding of an ancient branch of Buddhism.Reynolds  who died on Jan. 9 at age 88  was a leading expert in Theravada Buddhism  a religion predominantly practiced in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. He is remembered not only for his lasting impact on the field  but for his work as a teacher and mentor during his 34 years on the UChicago faculty.“He trained some of the greatest scholars of Buddhism  and of the broader history of religions  in our generation ” said Wendy Doniger  the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of the History of Religions. “His influence on both fields has been profound and far-reaching.”An ordained Baptist minister  Reynolds  AM’63  PhD’71  spent three years teaching at a university in Thailand before becoming a UChicago graduate student. His experience working with Christians  Buddhists and Muslims in Bangkok led him to seek a non-sectarian  empirically oriented approach to religious studies.In 1967  Reynolds joined the faculty at the University of Chicago  where his interests ranged from Thai civic religion to religious studies in the liberal arts. But Reynolds was held in particularly high regard for his work to deepen knowledge of Theravada Buddhism.“He shaped how Theravada Buddhism has come to be routinely studied in North America today by historians of religions and area specialists  by textualists as well as by anthropologists ” said former student Charles S. Hallisey  PhD’88  now the Yehan Numata Senior Lecturer on Buddhist Literatures at Harvard Divinity School.Reynolds held editorial responsibilities for various academic publications  including a decades-long stint as co-editor of theHistory of Religions Journal.Along with wife Mani Bloch he published a translation of a 14th-century Thai Buddhist cosmology The Three Worlds of King Ruang(1982).He retired in 2001 as Professor Emeritus of the History of Religions and Buddhist Studies in the Divinity School and the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations.In 2010  Reynolds received theNorman Maclean Faculty Award from UChicagoin recognition of his outstanding contributions to teaching and to the student experience of life on campus. Reynolds’ mentorship extended to colleagues as well  with Doniger calling him “the finest teacher I’ve ever known.”“He taught me how to teach  everything I know not only about the discipline of the history of religions  what questions to ask and what answers to value  but also about collegiality ” she said. “His generosity to his students  and to me  was part of a far deeper and broader virtue that he had in great abundance; a combination of incorruptible integrity  unflinching self-understanding and genuine concern for other human beings.“His decency  goodness and compassion were blessings to anyone who was lucky enough to know him ” she continued.He was preceded in death by his wife Mani. He is survived by sons Roy  Drew and Roger; nine grandchildren; and his partner of many years June Nash  AM’53  PhD’60.A memorial service will take place in spring. In lieu of flowers  the family requests that donations be directed to support the efforts of Reynolds’ student  Koson Srisang  to develop a new  updated mission for the Bangkok Student Christian Center. Checks can be made out to the Plainfield Congregational Church at 1 Church Lane  Plainfield MA  01070 (please reference the Frank Reynolds Future of the Bangkok SCC Project in the memo line).—Adapted from a story that first appeared on the Divinity School website.
                    Arūnas Liulevičius  mathematician and beloved UChicago teacher  1934-2018            ,For the nearly four decades that Prof. Arūnas Leonardas Liulevičius taught mathematics to undergraduates at the University of Chicago  he was regularly approached by former students telling him he had inspired them to pursue majors or careers in the field after taking his classes.Liulevičius  PhD’60  who died Dec. 21 at age 84  is remembered as a distinguished teacher who had a lasting impact on the lives of his students.“The thing about teaching undergraduate math is that people who are talented at explaining mathematics  but don’t also care about students  will not be successful ” said Robert Fefferman  the Max Mason Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics and Liulevičius’ colleague for more than 30 years. “You must decide it is important to you  to be dedicated  to be available  and that is what Arūnas was.”Liulevičius joined the University faculty in 1963 as a specialist in the burgeoning field of algebraic topology  a branch of mathematics that uses algebra to describe topological structures—objects as they are twisted or deformed. His first work  overseen by his adviser  eminent mathematician Saunders MacLane  solved a variant of a problem whose solution was considered one of the starting points of modern algebraic topology.Liulevičius wrote two sets of lecture notes on the subject Characteristic Classes and CobordismandOn Characteristic Classes which colleagues noted for their “crystal clarity” and quirky  understated humor. Its reviewer wrote: “These lecture notes are unusual in combining rigour and precision with a delightfully informal style…[the reader] will finish the notes feeling extremely friendly to the author.”Liulevičius also remains one of only a handful of professors ever to twice win the University’sLlewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.
                    Courtenay Wright  particle physicist and D-Day witness  1923-2018            ,Prof. Emeritus Courtenay Wright  a gifted teacher  World War II veteran and particle physicist who changed our understanding of the structure of protons and neutrons  died Nov. 22 in Chicago. He was 95.During a career that spanned more than 50 years at the University of Chicago  Wright worked with scientists including Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi on particle accelerator research that provided some of the foundational measurements of the properties of quarks—the fundamental building blocks of matter.During World War II  Wright decoded messages as a radar officer in the Royal Navy and was among the first to know about the launch of D-Day. He was aboard theHMS Apollowhen it ran aground carrying Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower to visit the beaches of Normandy on June 7  1944—the day after D-Day.“I could talk about Courtenay for days ” said crime novelist Sara Paretsky  AM’69  MBA’77  PhD’77  to whom Wright was married for 42 years. “I loved his zest for life and for taking risks  his meticulous attention to detail in his work—or in reviewing my own—but above all  a deep-rooted empathy and compassion that made him open to all people  all experiences. I will never stop missing him.”After the war  Wright earned his doctorate from the University of California-Berkeley  studying with Manhattan Project group leader and future Nobel laureate Emilio Segrè. Not long afterward  Fermi  who helpedbuild the world's first nuclear reactor at UChicago  recruited Wright to the University of Chicago.In the late ‘40s and early ‘50s  Wright studied physics processes related to nuclear fission and early nuclear reactors. The Chicago synchrocyclotron  a type of particle accelerator  became operational in 1951 under the direction of Fermi  and Wright performed experiments with the accelerator to better understand the scattering of protons and the symmetries they obey.“Wright made an incredible impact on the field of high-energy physics ” said Young-Kee Kim  the Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor and chair of the Department of Physics. “Modern experiments involving proton and neutron collisions rely on the knowledge of quark structure function that Wright and his contemporaries first established.”Hands-on engineeringIn 1971  Fermilab approved Wright’s “Experiment 98 ” which aimed to study the structure of the proton using muons as a probe with the help of an analyzing magnet from the Chicago synchrocyclotron. Wright helped orchestrate the move of the 2 500-ton magnet 45 miles from the University campus to Fermilab and built the detector for these experiments.“His muon scattering experiments at Fermilab helped us understand the behavior of the quarks in protons and were the precursors to experiments we now do with CERN’s Large Hadron Collider ” said Prof. Emeritus James Pilcher.Wright also studied the rare decays of muons using the linear accelerator at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. According to physics colleague Henry Frisch  Wright was a hands-on engineer  building trigger electronics for this experiment himself.“Courtenay was a beacon of thoughtfulness and consideration ” said Frisch  a professor of physics. “If a piece of equipment wasn’t working  you could ask him to take a look  and he always knew what was wrong.”Wright was involved in politics throughout his life: He was a member of JASON  a group of elite scientific advisers to the Pentagon during the Cold War  with whom he co-authored an analysis warning the U.S. not to use nuclear weapons in Vietnam.He also once drew a bid of $1 000 at an American Civil Liberties Union charity auction to explain general relativity to the bidder—a testament to his dedication to teaching and explaining physics clearly.Courtenay also carried on the UChicago physics tradition  begun by Albert Michelson  of playing pool in the Quadrangle Club. Under the aegis of Willie Zachariasen  Wright and Albert Crewe brought the game to new heights; two weeks before his death  Wright ran the table.He is survived by his wife as well as three children and one grandchild.
                    Riccardo Levi-Setti  physicist and trilobite collector  1927-2018            ,Prof. Emeritus Riccardo Levi-Setti  a pioneering physicist and Holocaust survivor whose wide-ranging interests spanned cosmic rays to microscopy to trilobite fossils  died Nov. 8 in Chicago at age 91.Referred to as a “Renaissance man” by his colleagues  Levi-Setti was active in exploring subatomic particles called strange quarks before pioneering new techniques in taking scientific images that revealed details about everything from superconductors to bones and kidneys.“He was a brilliant and broad leader  making important contributions from particle physics to evolution ” said Angela Olinto  dean of the Division of the Physical Sciences at the University of Chicago. “What’s more  he was a wonderfully curious and open-minded person.”He was also a world-renowned expert and collector of trilobites  tiny ancient marine creatures which he called the “butterflies of the sea.” Levi-Setti discovered thousands of the fossils on expeditions from Newfoundland to the Czech Republic. “It is time travel  and  at the same time  an addictive treasure hunt ” Levi-Setti wrote inTrilobites his seminal 1975 work on the subject.A Holocaust survivor who fought for the Italian resistance at the age of 16  Levi-Setti was recruited to University by Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi  who fled Italy before World War II to help lead the first nuclear reaction at UChicago. Levi-Setti was on the UChicago faculty for six decades and directed the interdisciplinary research institute that bears Fermi's name.He was born Riccardo Levi on July 11  1927 in Milan to Paolo and Gilda Levi  a decorated lieutenant colonel in the Italian army of World War I and a Venetian aristocrat. When Italy fell to the Nazis in 1943 and the SS took over the family apartment in Milan  his parents were both hidden by family friend Elisa Setti. Riccardo was secreted into the mountains  where he hid in barns or caves to avoid the Gestapo but often slipped away to search for fossils.These years in hiding informed the rest of his life  his family said. After the war  he and his brother Franco legally added the name Setti to theirs  in honor of all Mrs. Setti had done to save their parents.He received his doctorate in physics from the University of Pavia in 1949. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to travel to the U.S. (Due to his father’s insistence on an earlier ticket  he narrowly avoided a berth on theSSAndrea Doria which was fated to sink in one of the 20th century’s worst maritime disasters.)
                    R. Darrell Bock  influential scholar of educational metrics  1927–2021            ,Prof. Emeritus R. Darrell Bock  an eminent scholar and teacher who helped revolutionize educational assessments  died Sept. 15 at the age of 93.A longtime UChicago faculty member in the Departments of Psychology and Comparative Human Development  Bock was best known for his influential work on educational metrics and his many contributions to the statistical framework known as item response theory (IRT)  a term that he introduced which is still widely used.Over the course of his career  Bock greatly advanced the precision and accuracy of measurement in the social  behavioral and educational sciences. He also made significant contributions to numerous other areas of mathematical and statistical thinking  including linear algebra  multivariate statistics and quantitative genetics.“Darrell was a leader in the rich University of Chicago tradition of quantitative thinking  dramatically raising the sophistication of quantitative inquiry in the fields of education and psychology ” said Robert Gibbons  PhD’81  a former student who is now the Blum-Riese Professor of Biostatistics at UChicago. “He was a brilliant scholar and a devoted and compassionate teacher.”Born in Oakdale  Pennsylvania  on Sept. 17  1927  Bock attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) with classmate John Nash  a mathematician who would later share a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.After graduating with a chemistry degree in 1949  he came to the University of Chicago for graduate school  earning a master’s in 1950 and a Ph.D. in 1952  both in the study of educational practice.After a brief military service as a psychology assistant in the U.S. Army  Bock returned to UChicago in 1955. He taught as a research associate and assistant professor in UChicago’s Department of Psychology until 1958  when he became an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.In 1964  he returned to the University of Chicago as a professor of psychology and education  remaining on the Hyde Park campus for the rest of his career. At UChicago  Bock founded the Committee on Research Methodology and Quantitative Psychology in 1984 and chaired it for nearly a decade.That committee  said Prof. Guanglei Hong  “produced a generation of leading scholars. Among them were Robert Gibbons and Don Hedeker  who then helped with the reincarnation of this unique interdisciplinary research and training program.” Hong is the current chair of the committee  now known as theCommittee on Quantitative Methods in Social  Behavioral  and Health Sciences.Bock’s research  teaching and other professional activities have had far-reaching influence in educational measurement  psychology  statistics and linear algebra. He developed maximum marginal likelihood estimation to deal with the problem of increasing parameter space with an increasing number of subjects in both IRT model estimation and mixed-effects regression models. This led to multidimensional extensions of IRT and dramatic expansion of applications of IRT beyond educational measurement.“Darrell Bock can be regarded as a co-inventor of this theory ” said Stephen Raudenbush  the Lewis-Sebring Distinguished Service Professor of Sociology. “More than any other  he put IRT on a rigorous mathematical-statistical foundation  and the methods he derived are nearly universally applied in the practice of IRT and have implications for a broad array of other scientific applications.”Bock also made major contributions to the fields of behavioral genetics and auxology (the study of human growth). His landmark bookMultivariate Statistical Methods in Behavioral Research(1975) revolutionized the practice of statistics in the behavioral and social sciences. He is credited with introducing the multinomial logit model  which was a milestone development in nonlinear statistical theory. His final bookItem Response Theory  which he co-wrote with Gibbons  was published last month. Holding a copy of the book  Gibbons said  brought a smile to Bock’s face.Bock’s accomplishments led to national and international recognition and a long list of honors and awards. He served as president of the Psychometric Society and receiveda lifetime achievement awardfrom the organization in 2008. He was also a fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society.In 1990  he received theNational Council on Measurement in Education’s annual award  among the many honors that spoke to his renown and eminence in the field of educational testing and metrics.Nevertheless  Bock’s friends recalled him as humble and unassuming. “Despite being a giant both intellectually and physically  Darrell kept his presence quiet on the campus ” Hong said.Ina 2006 interview  Bock mentioned an award-winning essay that he had written as an undergraduate  a copy of which he rediscovered during a move. In characteristic fashion  Bock remarked that his writing had changed little in the intervening years  despite ample opportunity for improvement: “As it is  I seem doomed to compose nothing but my straightforward academic prose.”“Despite his statements to the contrary ” Gibbons said  “he was a brilliant writer whose works will remain an inspiration.”Outside of academia  Bock loved theater  art and photography. He was a gifted black-and-white photographer whose work was exhibited in New York City galleries  including an exhibit with his daughter Monica entitled “Soft Touch/Wondering Eye.” Even in later years  Bock enjoyed discussing photography and passed his love of the hobby onto his children and grandchildren.He is survived by his wife of 68 years  Renee Menegaz-Bock; three children  Conrad  Monica and Paul; and six grandchildren.
                    Joel Kraemer  scholar of Islamic and Jewish philosophy  1933-2018            ,In addition to being one of the premier scholars of Islamic and Jewish philosophy  Prof. Emeritus Joel Kraemer was as a master pedagogue who colleagues said “subscribed to the adage that ‘God lives in detail.’”Known for his work on the cultural transmission of the intellectual heritage of Greek antiquity to the worlds of Islamicate civilization  Kraemer was best known for his authoritative biography on the 12th-century philosopher Maimonides—a topic he first began studying at age 14.The John Henry Barrows Professor Emeritus in the Divinity School  Kraemer died Oct. 11 in Chicago after a protracted illness.“His teaching and scholarship were marked by a nigh-devotional reverence for the written and spoken word. His religious sensibilities were in particular evidenced in his love of Arabic ” said Paul Mendes-Flohr  the Dorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Modern Jewish History and Thought in the Divinity School. “In our casual perambulations about the Quad  he would often stop and recite for me Arabic poetry  fully cognizant that my knowledge of the language is rudimentary at best. He urged me to listen and appreciate the ‘supernal music’ of Arabic.”Kraemer was deeply learned in many fields  from Talmudic to Arabic philosophy  and his bookMaimonides: The Life and World of One of Civilization’s Greatest Mindswas a National Book Critics Circle finalist (in Criticism) for 2008. A festschrift in his honor Adaptations and Innovations: Studies on the Interaction between Jewish and Islamic Thought and Literature from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Twentieth Century  appeared in 2007.In addition to being a professor of Jewish studies  Kraemer served on the Committee on Jewish Studies  the Committee on Social Thought and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.Kraemer was born in New Jersey and was educated at Rutgers University  the Jewish Theological Seminary and Yale University. Well known among his published books areHumanism in the Renaissance of IslamandPhilosophy in the Renaissance of Islam. His more recent interests concerned the interplay of cultural and religious themes within Islam and Judaica. He was engaged in research on Judeo-Arabic manuscripts in the Cairo genizah and explored women’s letters from the genizah as part of a comprehensive study of Jewish women in the world of Islam. He also investigated Maimonides’ life and works in their Islamic context  such as in a book he edited Perspectives on Maimonides: Philosophical and Historical Studies.“Some of my fondest memories of the Divinity School involve conversations with Joel Kraemer ” said Ellen Haskell  PhD’05  the Herman & Zelda Bernard Distinguished Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of North Carolina  Greensboro. “He was an amazingly caring teacher who always made extra time to speak with students. His embrace of new academic technologies served as both a guide and an inspiration  while remaining grounded in an intimate knowledge of historical detail that brought his subjects to life.”Kraemer also held appointments at the Jewish Theological Seminary  Yale University and Tel Aviv University in Israel. Among other honors  he was a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research.—Article first appeared on the Divinity School website.

                    Edward Wasiolek  renowned scholar of Russian literature  1924–2018            ,In his 40-plus-year career at the University of Chicago  Prof. Emeritus Edward Wasiolek became a renowned scholar of Slavic and comparative literature  particularly of Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky.Wasiolek edited five volumes devoted to the notebooks for Dostoevsky’s novels  translated and edited volumes onCrime and PunishmentandThe Brothers Karamazov and wrote the widely acclaimedDostoevsky: The Major Fiction(1964). He also wroteTolstoy’s Major Fiction(1978) and gave a distinguished presentation on Tolstoy to the United Nations in 1988.Wasiolek  who passed away on May 3 at age 92  taught from 1955 to 1996 at UChicago  where he was the Avalon Foundation Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Slavic Languages and Literatures  Comparative Literature and the College. He also served as the chair of the Comparative Literature program and the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures.“Ed was instrumental to the resurgence of the Department of Comparative Literature  which exists today because of his dedication and passion ” said Françoise Meltzer  the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor and chair of the Department of Comparative Literature. “He was a remarkable colleague  scholar and friend.”Among his numerous awards  Wasiolek received the Gordon J. Laing Prize from the University of Chicago Press in 1973  fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and Guggenheim Foundation  and the covetedQuantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teachingin 1962.Wasiolek was born April 27  1924 in Camden  N.J. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946  Wasiolek earned his bachelor’s degree from Rutgers University and his master’s degree from Harvard University. While earning his PhD at Harvard  he served as a research associate at the Harvard Russian Research Center and contributed as an assistant author to one of its early publications.Wasiolek began his career at Harvard University as a teaching fellow in 1953. Originally hired at UChicago in 1955 in the Department of English Language and Literature  he later joined the newly formed Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the Comparative Literature program.In 1948  Wasiolek married Emma Jones Thomson  and they had three children: Mark Allan  Karen Lee and Eric Wade. Teaching at UChicago “was the best part of his life  besides his family and his beloved summer home in the Northwoods ” Karen Wasiolek said.
                    Ted Petry  last known witness to pioneering nuclear reaction at UChicago  1924-2018            ,In early 1942  Ted Petry was recruited out of high school to a secret government project at the University of Chicago  told only that it had “something to do with the war effort.” Little did the 17-year-old from the South Side of Chicago know that the $94-per-month job would be part of a groundbreaking experiment that ushered in the Atomic Age.Working for Nobel-winning scientists Arthur Compton and Enrico Fermi  Petry played a small but important role in the first controlled  self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Working as a messenger and laborer  Petry was one of the people who worked day and night to build the 20-foot reactor of graphite and uranium known as Chicago Pile-1 where the landmark discovery happened.The last known living person to witness one of the most important scientific experiments of the 20th century  Petry died July 28 at age 94.
                    Hellmut Fritzsche  experimental physicist who explored materials that led to flat-screen displays  1927-2018            ,Prof. Emeritus Hellmut Fritzsche spent his career exploring semiconductors—materials that are the foundation of modern electronics. In particular  the experimental physicist became one of the world’s foremost experts on amorphous semiconductors  working with inventor Stan Ovshinsky to turn these materials into technology that would define the late 20th century—TV displays  computer memory and solar panels.A member of the UChicago faculty for nearly 40 years and a former chairman of the Department of Physics  Fritzsche died June 17 at age 91. Colleagues remembered Fritzsche’s passion and energy  his intellectual generosity and his inventiveness in the laboratory.“He was a very clever experimentalist. He took enormous pride in being able to solve experimental problems ingeniously ” said Thomas Rosenbaum  president of California Institute of Technology and a former colleague in UChicago’s Department of Physics. “You’d go to his lab and see things he built which were very simple but could do very complicated measurements. He had that touch.”The Louis Block Professor Emeritus in Physics  Fritzsche was recruited to UChicago in 1957 after fixing the car of a stranded motorist who turned out to be with the UChicago physics faculty  said Morrel Cohen  a distinguished scientist at Rutgers University and senior chemist at Princeton University who worked with Fritzsche at UChicago for more than 20 years.Early in his career  Fritzsche was recommended by Nobel-winning physicist John Bardeen to serve as his stand-in to investigate the claims of then-unknown inventor Ovshinsky  who claimed to have discovered useful electronic effects in materials with very disordered structures. Until then  it was thought such effects needed a rigid crystalline structure.When the professor went to investigate  “he simply kicked Stan out of the laboratory and told him he would experiment with the materials on his own ” Cohen said. “When Hellmut finally came out  he said  ‘It’s real.’”The finding would be one of the top physics discoveries of the decade  and because amorphous semiconductors are much easier to manufacture in wide-area formats than crystalline versions  they would point a way to a number of technologies  from solar cells to flat-screen displays. (“TV May Become Glass Sheet on Wall ” predicted a short 1968 article in theMilwaukee Journalin which Fritzsche was quoted.)Fritzsche worked with the inventor to scientifically explain the behavior  and served as a consultant for Ovshinsky’s company Energy Conversion Devices as it expanded into solar cells  memory and electronics.“He did an outstanding job of sorting out the physics that was going on in these semiconductors  which was important technologically but also to our deeper fundamental understanding of condensed matter physics ” Cohen said.
                    D. Nicholas Rudall  who lifted Court Theatre to national stage  1940-2018            ,D. Nicholas Rudall  a longtime UChicago scholar and director who helped establish Court Theatre as one of the country’s premier theaters  died June 19 at age 78. He passed away peacefully surrounded by family at his daughter’s home in Tucson  Arizona after a hard-fought battle with cancer.An award-winning translator of Greek plays and a beloved UChicago professor for 40 years  Rudall brought a love of poetry to the classroom and made ancient texts come to life for his students. He is also widely credited with the energy and artistic vision that first propelled Court Theatre onto the national scene.In 1970  President Edward H. Levi asked Rudall to transform Court  which began as a community-based outdoor drama festival  into a professional theater. Rudall became artistic director of the theatre in 1972  and by the mid-1970s  the company had transitioned from working with students and community members to employing professional Equity actors.
                    Philip Roth  award-winning author and UChicago alumnus  1933-2018            ,Philip Roth  one of the iconic voices in American letters who credited his debut novella to a conversation he had while a University of Chicago graduate student  died May 22. He was 85 years old.Over a career that spanned six decades  Roth  AM’55  received almost every major literary prize  including the Pulitzer Prize  National Book Award  PEN/Faulkner Award and National Book Critics Circle prize.Other honors included the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal  as well as the Man Booker International Prize for his contributions to literature in English.Roth received his master’s degree in English from UChicago in 1955 and taught in the College’s writing program from 1956-58.In media interviews  Roth discussed the impact of his time at UChicago  where he took classes with former Dean of the Humanities Napier Wilt  became a protégé of Nobel laureateSaul Bellow  and studied alongside noted writer and editor Ted Solotaroff.In a 1983 interview with theChicago Tribune  Roth said of Chicago: “I’ve never felt as close to any other city I’ve lived in ” in part because of the young talent he met at the University—“the competition  the ambition  the stimulation  the talk.”Also in that interview Roth said he owed his debut novellaGoodbye  ColumbustoRichard Stern  the late Helen A. Regenstein Professor Emeritus in English Language and Literature. Over hamburgers at a Hyde Park tavern in 1955  Roth told Stern of his middle-class upbringing in New Jersey. “Dick got a kick out of the stories. ‘Why don’t you write that down?’ he said. My head was so full ofThe Golden Bowl  I thought he was having me on. But when I went home  I did it.”His talks with Stern  Roth said  “helped me to see that what was in front of my nose  though not as resounding as Conrad or as convoluted as James  qualified as fiction. That’s what I learned in Hyde Park  how to talk back to all those great books.”Roth’s time at UChicago influenced his work in other ways as well. Nathan Zuckerman  the protagonist of several Roth novels  is a UChicago alumnus  while Roth described former Dean Wilt as his “greatest supporter.”“I loved the University of Chicago ”he said in 2011upon winning the Man Booker International Prize. “[It] was in a great city and had great faculty and it had very  very smart students.” Roth said Bellow’s writing had a deep influence on his work and experience of the city. “[Bellow’s novel]Augie Marchwas my guide book  I read it like Fodor's guide to Chicago  y’know? Also it was so glamorous—it seemed to me  that I should be in this city that nourishes this guy.”Roth’s debut collection Goodbye  Columbuswon the National Book Award in 1960. He is perhaps best known for his 1969 novelPortnoy’s Complaint  a comic novel that attracted both praise and controversy for its frank discussion of sexuality. His other novels includeThe Counterlife  for which he won the 1987 National Book Critics Circle prize for fiction;American Pastoral  for which he won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; andOperation Shylock The Human StainandEverymanfor which he won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 1994  2001 and 2007  respectively.
                    Robert H. Malott  trustee emeritus  1926-2018            ,Trustee Emeritus Robert H. Malott  former chairman and chief executive officer of FMC Corporation  who served as vice chairman of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees  died April 4. He was 91 years old.Malott was elected a trustee of the University in 1976. He served as vice chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1988 to 1993  was elected a life trustee in 1993  and was named a trustee emeritus in 2007. Malott joined FMC in 1952 and was elected chief executive in 1971  moving the corporate headquarters to Chicago. He led FMC for two decades  retiring in 1991.Malott’s civic leadership and philanthropic work ranged from higher education to scientific research to the arts. He served on the governing board of Argonne National Laboratory  which the University manages for the U.S. Department of Energy  and chairman of the board of overseers of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Malott was chairman of the board of the National Museum of Natural History and served on the boards of the Public Broadcasting Service  the National World War II Museum and the National Academy of Sciences. He was a life director of the Lyric Opera Company of Chicago and the Chicago Botanic Garden.Malott was born in Boston. His father  Deane W. Malott  became chancellor of the University of Kansas where his son enrolled at age 16  studying chemistry and playing basketball. Malott enlisted in the U.S. Navy a year later and served on an electronics repair ship stationed in San Francisco. After World War II  he returned to the University of Kansas to finish his bachelor's degree. He earned an MBA from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and attended New York University Law School. Malott served as assistant to the dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration before joining FMC.Malott is survived by his three children  Liza  Barb and Deane. Elizabeth “Ibby” Malott  his wife of 43 years  died in 2003. In keeping with UChicago board tradition  a memorial resolution in honor of Malott will be presented at the board meeting in May.
                    Moishe Postone  leading interpreter of Marx and scholar of European intellectual history  1942-2018            ,Prof. Moishe Postone  a scholar of 19th- and 20th-century European intellectual history and one of the world’s leading interpreters of Karl Marx  passed away on March 19. He was 75.Part of the University of Chicago faculty for more than three decades  Postone  SB’63  AM’67  taught generations of undergraduates through the Core sequence on Self  Culture and Society. The Thomas E. Donnelley Professor of History and the College  he was also a faculty member in theCenter for Jewish Studiesand co-director of theChicago Center for Contemporary Theory.Postone was called one of the most important commentators of Marx to come out of the “New Left” generation of the late 1960s. A scholar focused on capitalism  modern anti-Semitism and questions around memory and identity in postwar Germany  his 1993 opusTime  Labor and Social Dominationis still widely read  debated and discussed in the field.“Moishe Postone’s scholarship on Marx’s critique of political economy had a transformational impact on the field of late-20th-century Marxist studies ” said John W. Boyer  dean of the College. “He was an ideal scholar-teacher and critical intellectual in the great Chicago tradition of liberal education  and his impact will long be felt on the intellectual personalities and personal lives of the thousands of students who had the privilege to work with him.”Postone said his first awakening to the world of social thought came as a UChicago undergraduate  when he was exposed to the works of Marx as a biochemistry student. As a grad student  Postone participated in a 1969 student sit-in at the University’s Administration Building; in its aftermath  he led one of two student study groups seeking to understand the historical moment through social theory. After receiving his PhD from the Goethe-Universität in Germany  Postone returned to Chicago  working with the Center for Transcultural Studies before joining the University of Chicago as an instructor in 1987  where he would remain for the rest of his career.“As a scholar  teacher  advisor  mentor and colleague  his service to the University and to many disciplines—history  sociology  political science  Jewish studies and Germanic languages and literatures  to name but a few—is a remarkable testament to a career of service to peers and students alike ” said Amanda Woodward  the William S. Gray Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology and interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UChicago.Postone’s research revolved around a reinterpretation of Marx and his theories of labor. His work sought to place Marx’s work in context with the great social upheavals of the 20th century  and how the succeeding generations had interpreted it. He was also particularly interested in understanding 20th-century anti-Semitism through the lens of capitalism and its reactionary social movements  such as the rise of national socialism that preceded the Holocaust.“Moishe Postone was an internationally recognized historian and practitioner of critical theory; his reinterpretations of Marx’s thinking—both in his published work and in his graduate colloquia—were insightful and influential ” said Prof. Emilio Kourí  who chairs UChicago’s Department of History. “A gifted teacher  he trained generations of scholars in European intellectual history.”For more nearly three decades  Postone also chaired the Core sequence on Self  Culture and Society—one of the four general education social science tracks that undergraduates are required to take at the University of Chicago. “His leadership of that course played a very influential role in the modern history of the College ” Boyer said. “Moishe was a remarkable  charismatic teacher who believed deeply in the fundamental importance of Chicago’s traditions of general education.”In 1999 he won a Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. “I do not want students writing papers just for me  their teacher  but to take responsibility for communicating what they think ” hetold theUniversity of Chicago Chronicleat the time.He continued to teach  write and organize as he battled cancer; in 2016  Postone delivered the Vienna Prize Lecture at the International Research Center for Cultural Studies in Vienna  and delivered a keynote address on right-wing populism at the Vienna Humanities Festival this past autumn.A University memorial service is being planned for the spring.
                    Peter Freund  particle physicist and fiction writer  1936-2018            ,“Physicists do not live in an ivory tower; they are not spared the ravages of history ” wrote Prof. Peter Freund upon his retirement at the University of Chicago in 2002  following a half-century career in supersymmetry and string theory.Freund knew. Born into a Romanian Jewish family during a tumultuous era in Europe  he narrowly avoided the Holocaust and later a Communist firing squad before escaping the country. He eventually became a professor at the University of Chicago  studying particle physics. But even as he picked at the fabric holding the universe together  he was thinking about art  beauty and the forces of history.Freund  who later wrote fiction and nonfiction that explored the themes of morality  fate  beauty  war and oppression that had impacted his life  died March 6. He was 81.Freund was born in 1936 in Timișoara  Romania to a wealthy Jewish family; his mother was an opera singer  his father a doctor. Even as other Jews were executed or sent to concentration camps during World War II  their community survived by bribing officials. But the Soviet rule that followed proved dangerous too. In 1956  Freund joined a demonstration that ended with him and other students lined up against a wall with Communist tanks pointed at them. Somehow the order to fire never came  and the students escaped.Shortly after  the family fled to Austria  and Freund got his PhD in physics at the University of Vienna. In 1965  he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago  where he would remain for the rest of his career.
                    George S. Tolley  pioneer in environmental  urban and energy economics  1925-2021            ,George S. Tolley  the noted economist who led groundbreaking research on resource use  farm labor migration  urban economics  and environmental economics  died Aug. 31 at the age of 95.A professor emeritus in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics  Tolley was a pioneer in environmental  urban  and energy economics  working in higher education  civil service  and private consultancy. His research covered a broad range of topics  including migration and agricultural policy  water allocation  water investments in depressed areas  international trade in agriculture and economic development  social costs and rural-urban balance  resource allocation effects of environmental policies  fiscal externalities and suburbanization  road capacity and city size  tax rates and national incomes  and freeing up transit markets.“Tolley was part of a group of very distinguished economists at Chicago ” said James J. Heckman  the Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor in Economics. “They created an atmosphere that has been accurately described as really thinking the purpose of the economics department was a serious one and there to solve the problems of the world—and to do it in a way that was lasting and empirically grounded in understanding a wide range of public policy questions. George was in that group and was a very active player—a student of that environment who kept it alive and helped it flourish.”Born in Washington  D.C.  Tolley’s early life—particularly living through the Great Depression—shaped his interest in economics. “I was going to devote my life to make sure it didn’t happen again ” Tolley said ina 2018 interview. “If I want to do something useful  that's what I should do.”But he also had an inside look at the world of economics through his father  Howard R. Tolley  who served as chief of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (subsequently consolidated with other USDA units) during the New Deal and World War II. The younger Tolley recalled summers spent at a desk in his father’s outer office.Tolley attended American University for undergraduate studies before heading to UChicago for graduate school  earning his Ph.D. in economics in 1955. He said he rejected the idea of going to an Ivy League school  instead preferring the idea of “rough and tumble” Chicago where he found more intellectual freedom without the confines of being proper.It was here he encountered some of the best-known minds in economics and mathematics: Theodore Schultz  Milton Friedman  Frank Knight  Harry Markowitz  Jacob Marschak  Tjalling Koopmans  D. Gale Johnson and Oskar Lange  to name a few. (He was also good friends with fellow student Mike Nichols  who went on to direct classic movies includingThe Graduate.) Tolley was part of Schultz’s agriculture group at UChicago  studying problems of agricultural modernization in the U.S. and worldwide. The primary paper from his dissertation was published in theJournal of Farm Economicsand received the cash prize for excellence from the American Farm Economics Association.After receiving his Ph.D.  Tolley spent 11 years as a faculty member at North Carolina State University as associate professor of agricultural economics before returning to UChicago as a professor in 1966. He shifted his focus from agriculture to urban economics  establishing urban economics as an area in the UChicago graduate program by the early 1970s—a rare offering in economics departments at the time. But his approach remained in the Chicago tradition in that it drew on price theory to analyze urban problems. Tolley served as director of the Center for Urban Studies at UChicago from 1978 to 1985. More recent work in the field of urban economics is often based on Tolley’s“city bigness” framework.Tolley was particularly compelling for his ability to move across economic fields and subjects  which also gave his work deep policy relevance. He was an internationally recognized leader in the development and application of techniques for measuring costs and values that are determined outside of conventional markets. He used such techniques to bring a modern lens to the field in addressing urban and environmental economics. For one example  Tolley developed a practical benefit-cost framework for dealing with pollution in the Chicago area with funding from the National Science Foundation.“George Tolley hired me as his research assistant when he was a young assistant professor in the economics department. He was a very patient teacher of his young helper ” said Prof. Emeritus Lester G. Telser  a longtime colleague in the Department of Economics. “At the end of the summer I had to decide whether I would return to Harvard. I made an appointment with Theodore W. Schultz  head of the economics department. Given my experience with George  T. W. did not have a hard sell. I switched to the University of Chicago.”Beginning in the 1960s  Tolley consulted for federal  state  and municipal agencies on urban and environmental problems. His research and expertise helped with the design of such policies as the Clean Air Act  and his techniques have helped determine the valuation of urban and environmental amenities and improvements in health and medical treatments. This included his seminal work on health economics Valuing Health for Policy: An Economic Approach  which moved the field to a broader view of the economics of wellness.“His work on public policy questions was very influential when it was written and remains so now ” said Robert E. Lucas  the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Economics.Tolley’s work outside of academia included his time as director of the Economic Development Division of the Economic Research Service of the USDA from 1964 to 1965 — the direct descendant of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that his father once led. In 1974 and 1975  he served as deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Tax Analysis of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Tolley also served on the President's Task Force on Urban Renewal  the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Automotive Pollution  and the Energy Engineering Board at the National Research Council.Tolley was elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003 and founded the journalResource and Energy Economics  which publisheda special issue in his honorin 2001. He held visiting professorships at the University of California  Berkeley; Purdue University; Nankai University; and Guelph University. He was the recipient of the Honor A Colleague award by the Society for Benefit Cost Analysis in 2018. His published works include 22 books and more than 50 articles. He also served as CEO of RCF Consulting—his own firm—where he directed mail volume forecasting work for the U.S. Postal Service and helped the USPS develop approaches to postal volume forecasts.Many in the UChicago community also recall Tolley as a mentor. He directed 69 PhD dissertations as committee chair  one each year in his 12 years at North Carolina State and 57 at UChicago. In the 2001 special issue ofResource and Energy Economics  University of Kentucky economist Glenn C. Blomquist made note of Tolley’s ability to educate students  colleagues and policymakers:“George S. Tolley’s gentle but probing questions have influenced his colleagues and generations of graduate students to think more clearly about how to use their economic tool kit to answer policy questions. He has been equally able to influence the broader group of social scientists and public administrators who develop and implement public policy. As a member of multidisciplinary academic committees and while working with and in government  he has been able to focus attention on basic economic questions. How will individuals react to this policy? How will achieving this policy goal affect the attainment of other policy goals? While many economists can tell noneconomists these things  George’s great talent is in getting them to believe that they had discovered these issues on their own.”Tolley gave his time generously to others  whether exchanging ideas  offering advice or establishing collaborations. Numerous economists received his guidance  many of whom also rose to prominence in public service  financial institutions  and universities across the globe.“His students were fiercely loyal to him ” Heckman said. “He was very active on Ph.D. theses and working with students. He’s got a big legacy of producing people and producing ideas—and his students are continuing that.”Economist Vinod Thomas  AM’74  PhD’77 and currently a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore  studied under Tolley and eventually collaborated with him on research for the World Bank. He said Tolley had a highly respected global presence  and was a “low-key but forceful leader in applying empirical economics to vexing country problems.”But locally on the UChicago campus  Thomas remembered Tolley giving liberally of his time  including his personal time: “I recall putting the finishing touches to my Ph.D. thesis while going with him to pick up some items at the supermarket for a late meal that Alice Tolley—with their daughter Catherine in our midst—would graciously host at their home in Hyde Park.”George Tolley is survived by his wife Alice  his daughter Catherine  son-in-law Bill and two grandsons.The Tolley family requests that any gifts in his memory be directed to the George S. Tolley Prize. The prize was initiated by Thomas to recognize and reward a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Economics whose research paper demonstrates the potential for the impact of economic analysis on policy.

                    John T. Cacioppo  pioneer and founder of the field of social neuroscience  1951-2018            ,Prof. John T. Cacioppo  a pioneer and founder of the field of social neuroscience whose research on loneliness helped to transform psychology and neuroscience  died unexpectedly and peacefully at home on March 5. He was 66.Cacioppo was the Tiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago and served as director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience and chair of the Social Psychology Program. He is survived by his beloved wife  Stephanie  director of the brain dynamics laboratory at the University; and two children  Anthony and Christina.“John’s passing is a profound loss for the field  the University  and the many  many colleagues  students and friends who knew him and learned from his myriad of contributions ” said Amanda Woodward  the William S. Gray Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology and interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences. “His influence across psychology  social neuroscience and health science was enormous  not only as a scientist but as an advocate for science. His legacy cannot be overstated.”Cacioppo’s colleagues and family said he will be remembered as a truth seeker  creative genius  brilliant scientist  innovator  colleague  teacher  mentor  leader  father and husband.“There are so few people of whom we can truly say  ‘He was one of a kind ’ but of John it was painfully  obviously true ” said Daniel Gilbert  the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University.Social neuroscience as a distinct field of study was first coined by Cacioppo and colleagues at Ohio State University in 1992. The interdisciplinary field that Cacioppo developed focused on human and animal investigations of the multi-level interactions between neural  hormonal  cellular  and genetic/genomic mechanisms underlying social structures and processes. While most research in neuroscience focused on the individual  the new discipline examined the associations between social and neural development and evolution from a multi-disciplinary perspective.“John's work embodied everything we strive for: tackling the most important questions with all the tools available  no matter how big the challenge ” said former colleague Ralph Adolphs  the Bren Professor of Psychology  Neuroscience and Biology at the California Institute of Technology.‘Visionary research’Born June 12  1951 in Marshall  Texas  Cacioppo received his PhD in psychology from the Ohio State University in 1977. He began his career at the University of Notre Dame before returning to Ohio State in 1989. He joined the University of Chicago’s faculty in 1999.“John Cacioppo conducted visionary research that made groundbreaking contributions to psychology and other fields in the social and biological sciences ” said Susan Levine  the Rebecca Anne Boylan Professor in Education and Society and chair of the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago. “As a colleague  he played a leading role in our graduate program in Social Psychology and was a dedicated undergraduate teacher regularly teaching Fundamentals of Psychology  which introduces many students to the field. He will be greatly missed.”Cacioppo began his research by exploring what happens to the brain when social connections are absent. For two decades he studied social fitness  resilience and the effects of loneliness  showing the negative impacts social isolation has not only on mental health but physical health.“The purpose of loneliness is like the purpose of hunger ” Cacioppo said in a2017 interview withThe Atlantic.“Hunger takes care of your physical body. Loneliness takes care of your social body  which you also need to survive and prosper. We’re a social species.”In a2016 interviewwith theGuardian  he had emphasized that human beings thrive best when not only receiving  but also giving  affection: “One of the things that we have learned is that avoiding loneliness is not about ‘getting ’ not about being a recipient. Despite what economists say  that is not how we are designed. We need mutual aid and protection.”
                    Steven Collins  world-renowned scholar of Buddhism  1951-2018            ,Prof. Steven Collins  a world-renowned scholar of Buddhism and its associated Pali language  passed away from natural causes Feb. 15  while leading a seminar in New Zealand. He was 66.The Chester D. Tripp Professor in the Humanities  Collins chaired the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations several times since joining the UChicago faculty in 1991. He was also associate faculty in the Divinity School.Whitney Cox  associate professor and chair of South Asian Languages and Civilizations  said Collins was one of his generation’s most distinguished historians of premodern Southern Asia.“He was perhaps the single most sheerly intelligent person I’ve ever known  a great citizen of the University  and a wise and compassionate teacher and friend ” Cox said. He described Collins as a “doting husband  father and grandfather  an obsessive Miles Davis and John Coltrane fan  and a lifelong supporter of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. soccer.”Collins was the author of several books on Buddhist studies. His thesis became the basis for his first book Selfless Persons.He later examined the makings of Buddhist civilization—an idea he explored inNirvana: Concept  Imagery  Narrative. Most recently he was writing about civilization  wisdom and practices of the self.Daniel Arnold  associate professor of the philosophy of religions in UChicago’s Divinity School  said he had a “transformative encounter” with Collins’Selfless Personsas a graduate student. He later became Collins’ colleague and counted him a friend.“I will miss many things after his tragically untimely passing ” Arnold said. “May all who of us who learned from his exemplary intellectual engagement strive to continue bringing something of this lost clarity of thought to a world badly in need of it.”Collins is survived by his wife  Claude Grangier  senior lecturer in Romance Languages and Literatures at UChicago; as well as three children and three grandchildren.
                    Jack Halpern  ‘towering intellect’ in field of inorganic chemistry  1925-2018            ,Prof. Emeritus Jack Halpern  widely recognized for his pioneering and influential contributions to the field of inorganic chemistry  died Jan. 31. He was 93.The Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Chemistry  Halpern made seminal contributions to the field  particularly his research on catalysts—the magic agents that speed up chemical reactions. He helped usher in the flowering of catalysis chemistry in the latter half of the 20th century  crucial for manufacturing everything from pharmaceuticals to adhesives. His work to decode the mechanics of chemical reactions underlies many modern chemical manufacturing processes.“He was a towering intellect ” said Prof. Viresh Rawal  who chairs the University’s Department of Chemistry. “Many chemical reaction pathways are highly complex  involving one or more transient intermediates on the way to the final products. Jack  with his very deep understanding of kinetics and reaction mechanisms  carried out careful experiments to unravel those pathways.”Born in Poland in 1925  Halpern moved to Canada with his family at a young age  where he received his BSc and PhD degrees in chemistry from McGill University in Montreal. After stints in Manchester and Vancouver  in 1962 he joined the faculty at UChicago  where he would remain for the rest of his career.Halpern’s work focused on understanding the fundamental chemistry of transition metals—the compounds they form and the reactions they undergo. By fully understanding these processes  researchers can tinker with the reactions to yield the exact form of the compound that they wish to produce. For example  when pharmaceutical companies make drugs  they often need the molecule to come out with the right chirality (a right- or left-flipped mirror version of the molecule) or else the drug won’t be effective.“Jack was the preeminent mechanistic inorganic chemist of the 20th century—a real pioneer ” said Richard Jordan  the Paul Snowden Russell Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry. “He was an unbelievably rigorous scientist  known for studying his systems in great detail and providing very strong evidence for his conclusions. He also had incredible command of the field; whenever you went to ask him about some new research  he would refer you to some experiment done in 1978 that gave you a broader perspective on your work.”Within the department  chemistry faculty sometimes refer to the “Halpern theorem”: that just because a chemist can isolate a chemical intermediate thought to be part of the reaction pathway  it does not mean that it is a primary actor in the reaction. “Jack demonstrated this principle through his work  and it is now widely accepted ” Rawal said.Another contribution was his quantitative measurements of bond energies—laying out the relationships between bonds of various types in chemical reactions  and thus how likely they are to form under various circumstances. For example  he studied the bonds that form during reactions with vitamin B12  which teased out how the vitamin works.“When I think of the University of Chicago  Jack is the type of scholar who I think of as emblematic ” said Chuan He  the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology  who once shared an office suite with Halpern. “He was a pure scholar; not flashy  just a deep understanding and knowledge of the field. Whenever someone came to give a seminar in our department  after they finished giving their talk  Jack’s hand would go up and the speaker would get visibly nervous  knowing a very thoughtful and difficult question was coming their way.”Halpern worked extensively as an editor of scientific journals  first with theJournal of the American Chemical Societyand then for the National Academy of Sciences  where he served as vice president from 1993 to 2001 and as an associate editor of theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesfor many years.His honors include the Willard Gibbs Medal of the American Chemical Society  the Paracelsus Prize of the Swiss Chemical Society and the Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry. He was a member of the Royal Society of London  the Royal Society of Canada  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and National Academy of Sciences  among others. He also consulted for Monsanto and worked with Argonne National Laboratory.His children said that his passion for chemistry was matched by his and his late wife Helen’s passion for the arts; he served on the board of directors of the University of Chicago’s Court Theatre and Smart Museum of Art for many years. The pair collected 20th-century art  particularly cubism  expressionism and surrealism.Halpern is survived by daughters  Janice and Nina; grandchildren  Jared Henry and Claire Henry; great grandchild  Andrew Henry; brother  Norman; and many nieces and nephews.

                    Robert McCormick Adams  anthropologist  former provost and Oriental Institute director  1926-2018            ,By 1950  University of Chicago student Robert McCormick Adams had already been a steel mill worker  a physics student and a Navy radio technician  and thought he wanted to be a journalist. Then one day his professor  renowned anthropologist Robert Braidwood  had a sudden opening on an archaeological dig in the foothills of Iraq that would change Adams’ life.Adams  PhB’47  AM’52  PhD’56  was picked because he knew how to work on cars  but the chance trip would lead to decades of digs in Iraq  Mexico  Iran and Saudi Arabia. It opened a wide-ranging career at the University of Chicago  where he spent nearly three decades and served as director of the Oriental Institute and provost of the University before leaving to direct the Smithsonian Institution.The Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Anthropology  Adams died Jan. 27 at age 91. Colleagues remember the prolific scholar as one of the most influential figures in the archaeology of ancient complex societies  who fundamentally transformed theories about the origins of urbanism before leaving to shape museums in the nation’s capital.“Bob was a towering figure of Near Eastern archaeology and a pioneer of innovative methods of landscape archaeology ” said Christopher Woods  director of the Oriental Institute. “He was fundamentally interested in the reciprocal interaction between humans and their environments—how civilization and geography are inextricably intertwined.”Adams’ scholarship focused on the relationships between societies and their environment  with particular interest in social evolutionary theory and how innovation is connected to societal structure. He was an early pioneer of the technique of using aerial photography and satellite images  which he combined with historical and ethnographic data to investigate settlement patterns  irrigation structures and early urbanism. Later in his career Adams was renowned for his lucid observations about the responsibilities of archaeologists—and science itself.Adams later served as director of the Oriental Institute from 1962-68 and 1981-83. He was dean of the Division of the Social Sciences from 1970-74 before being appointed provost of the University in 1982.“As a student  a scholar and an administrator  Professor Adams made contributions to the University of Chicago throughout his life ” said Amanda Woodward  interim dean of the Division of the Social Sciences and the William S. Gray Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology. “His many achievements are a testament to his dedication to this institution  and his leadership not only influenced the Division of the Social Sciences and the Oriental Institute but also enriched the reach of the social sciences to people across the nation.”During his decade-long tenure at the Smithsonian  Adams oversaw the opening of the National Museum of the American Indian  the National Museum of African Art and the National Postal Museum. He also headed renovations to aging infrastructure  encouraged digitization of its research  made a point to involve indigenous communities in museum planning  and oversaw a shift to spotlight darker or more controversial points of American history and science  such as anEnola Gayexhibit in the National Air and Space Museum.His numerous books includeThe Evolution of Urban Society  Paths of Fire  Heartland of CitiesandThe Land Behind Baghdad.After his retirement in 1994  he continued his research as an adjunct professor at the University of California in San Diego.In anAmerican Antiquityarticle reviewing Adams’ work  Norman Yoffee wrote  “Few archaeologists have had the power to influence the course of their times as has Adams  nor to have done it so well.”His honors include the distinguished service award from the Society of American Archaeology and the UChicago Alumni Association’s Alumni Medal  bestowed for achievement of an exceptional nature.At the University he met and married Ruth Salzman Adams  who became the editor ofTheBulletin of Atomic Scientistsand director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. She died in 2005.
                    Robert J. LaLonde  pioneering scholar  beloved colleague and mentor  1958-2018            ,Robert J. LaLonde  AB’80  was a passionate scholar whose pioneering methods continue to impact public policy and economics. But colleagues will remember the professor at the University of ChicagoHarris School of Public Policyas a beloved friend and mentor whose dedication and enthusiasm inspired faculty  students and alumni.LaLonde  who died Jan. 17 at age 59 following a long illness  was a leading scholar in the fields of labor economics  econometrics and program evaluation  and made important contributions to research on workplace issues  education and the economic effects of immigration. A UChicago faculty member for three decades  LaLonde is perhaps best known as director of the PhD program at Harris Public Policy  serving on 21 dissertation committees at Harris  as well as committees for the Department of Economics and the Booth School of Business.“Bob left an indelible mark on this institution and the lives of so many people over the decades he spent at the University. Today  we grieve a beloved colleague  mentor  teacher and adviser ” wrote Dean Katherine Baickerin a note to the Harris community.LaLonde’s research spanned topics of program evaluation  education and training of the workforce  economic effects of immigration in the United States  costs of worker displacement  impact of unions and collective bargaining in the United States  and economic and social consequences of incarceration.“Bob’s work changed the way we all approach research and how we understand the world. But more than that  he was the type of decent and kind person that parents want their kids to be when they grow up ” said Michael Greenstone  the Milton Friedman Professor in Economics  the College and Harris.Deeply concerned about issues of inequality in America  LaLonde studied job training programs targeted toward the disadvantaged  the plight of women in Illinois prisons and their children  and the employment prospects of young men after they are paroled from prison.“Bob was an integral part of the labor economics community at the University of Chicago. His work on the earnings losses of displaced workers has been hugely influential to both academics and policymakers ” said Erik Hurst  the V. Duane Rath Professor of Economics at Chicago Booth.Hurst called LaLonde  whom he got to know on the Little League fields on the South Side  “an integral member of the Hyde Park community.” LaLonde’s commitment to community issues was reflected in his service on the board of Public/Private Ventures  a national nonprofit organization working to improve the effectiveness of social policies  programs and community initiatives.“Bob LaLonde was my colleague  coauthor and loyal friend for over 30 years ” said Robert Topel  the Sidore Brown and Gladys J. Brown Distinguished Service Professor at Chicago Booth. “He was an outstanding economist  with a number of important contributions  but an even better husband and father. His service to the University  which became a struggle in later years  was unsurpassed.”The far-reaching influence of LaLonde’s work has been chronicled by academic journals  most recently through aseries of essayspublished in his honor by theJournal of Labor Economics. To honor his contributions to economics  a conference was held two years ago at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. LaLonde served as a fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Institute for the Study of Labor  as well as a senior staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers from 1987-1988.LaLonde is survived by his wife  Laura Skosey  a lecturer in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at UChicago; and their children  Elena Skosey-LaLonde  Eve Skosey-LaLonde and Julian Skosey-LaLonde; his father Robert T.

                    Milton J. Rosenberg  professor of psychology and Chicago radio host  1925-2018            ,Prof. Emeritus Milton J. Rosenberg  a longtime scholar at the University of Chicago and revered radio show host  died Jan. 9. He was 92.Rosenberg studied social psychology  authored books on Vietnam and U.S. foreign relations  reviewed books for theChicago Tribune  and taught four decades of students at UChicago.His largest audience was the millions of listeners who tuned into his daily interview radio showExtension 720on WGN  in which he hosted guests from Carl Sagan to Julia Child  Jimmy Carter to Gloria Steinem and discussed topics from baseball to world religions to Watergate. The show ran for nearly 40 years and garnered him admirers around the country for its intellectual and engaging tone; radio personality Ed Schwartz called him “the best wordsmith on the Chicago radio dial.”“He had on the most interesting authors and public intellectuals  actually listened to what they said  engaged them seriously  and never  ever talked down to his audience ” said Charles Lipson  the Peter B. Ritzma Professor Emeritus in Political Science and the College at the University. “His station was not a rarefied  specialized one; it was the biggest in Chicago. He assumed his listeners wanted to be pushed intellectually  whether they had PhDs or GEDs.”As a researcher  Rosenberg focused on the causes and consequences of social interaction  particularly attitude acquisition and attitude change. His work investigated influencing factors such as rhetoric or propaganda and hidden dynamics of public opinion  including whether people are honest to interviewers  according to the National Endowment for the Humanities  which awarded Rosenberg the National Humanities Medal in 2008.Rosenberg authored multiple books  includingBeyond Conflict and ContainmentandAttitude Organization and Change. He was best known forVietnam and the Silent Majority: The Dove’s Guidein which he and his co-authors looked to develop an alternative form of public protest.Born in New York City in 1925  Rosenberg attended Brooklyn College and received degrees at University of Wisconsin and University of Michigan. He taught at Yale  Ohio State and Dartmouth before joining the University of Chicago in 1965  where he remained until his retirement in 1996.WGN selected Rosenberg to host a new talk show in 1973; the program ran for four decades and was broadcast in 38 states. His path to radio host started with Rosenberg moderating recorded conversations between UChicago faculty members and visitors to campus  including one between Nobel laureates Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. Tapes of such conversations were shared with radio stations across the country. Rosenberg was a frequent guest onExtension 720before becoming the host  saying he thought he’d just host the show for a year or two and buy a new car  according to the National Endowment for the Humanities.He was a skilled interviewer able to deftly draw guests into lively discussion  demonstrating an impressive command of subjects across the political and academic spectrum. His longtime friend Joseph A. Morris  AB’73  JD’76  described the show as a series of “extraordinary conversations … held for the benefit of millions of Americans listening to his program each night in their homes and cars across the nation.”Musing on the show Chicago Tribunejournalist Michael Kilian called Rosenberg “excruciatingly erudite yet engaging”—able to “leap from ward politics to nuclear warhead throw-weights to Etruscan philosophy in a single bound  and then do a commercial for Vienna Red Hots.”When Rosenberg was awarded the National Humanities Medal  the citation proclaimed: “Combining a scholar’s understanding and a teacher’s openness  he has made a home in radio for elevated conversation and profound thought.” Even after the show officially ended in 2012  he continued to broadcast on other shows and podcasts.He received multiple broadcasting honors  including a star on WGN’s Walk of Fame outside of Tribune Tower.He is survived by his wife  Marjorie Rosenberg; son Matthew; two grandchildren  Max and Ava; and his brother  Norman  a distinguished climatologist. Rosenberg is also survived  Morris notes  by “thousands of students and millions of listeners who will no longer hear his voice probing the far reaches of the cosmos  the fine details of history and literature  and the depths of the human mind.”
                    Robert N. Clayton  ‘one of the giants’ of cosmochemistry  1930-2017            ,Prof. Emeritus Robert N. Clayton  whose pioneering research on the chemistry of meteorites and lunar rocks helped shape the field of cosmochemistry  died on Dec. 30. He was 87.In the foreword of abook dedicated to Clayton  Smithsonian geologist Glenn MacPherson wrote that Clayton “could easily wear the name ‘Mr. Oxygen.’” Clayton pioneered the use of oxygen isotopes as “fingerprints ” creating a relatively simple test to distinguish meteorites from ordinary rocks as well as a revolution in the burgeoning field of cosmochemistry.Clayton  the Enrico Fermi Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Chemistry  Geophysical Sciences and the Enrico Fermi Institute  joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1958. Early in his career  he studied lunar rocks retrieved by the Apollo missions. His breakthrough came when he tested meteorites for the isotope oxygen-17 in addition to the usually studied oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. To the surprise of everyone in the field  he found that the ratio of these isotopes was extremely unusual  very different from Earth rocks.The finding offered a scientific mystery that is yet to be fully solved—and a straightforward test to identify meteorites. “It was a profound discovery ” said Prof. Andrew Davis  who chairs the Department of Geophysical Sciences at UChicago and first worked with Clayton as a postdoctoral scholar in the late 1970s  “and it paved the way for a whole new line of inquiry.”Clayton’s results  published in a seminal 1973 paper  energized the emerging field of cosmochemistry  which uses chemistry as a way to learn not only about meteorite age  source and history but how the planets and bodies formed in the early solar system. Analyzing the isotopes in rock samples reveals information about the conditions under which that rock formed  and the oxygen-17 measurements showed that the meteorites formed by a very unusual chemical process or circumstance. What exactly those circumstances were  and their ramifications for our picture of the early solar system  are still hotly debated.Along with his longtime research associate  chemistToshiko Mayeda  Clayton became the go-to source for meteorite analysis. “You’ll find his name on many  many papers describing new meteorites ” said Lawrence Grossman  UChicago professor emeritus in the Department of Geophysical Sciences  who co-authored the 1973 paper with Clayton. “He was really one of the giants of the field of cosmochemistry.”Though Clayton and Mayeda created a number of tests and techniques widely used in the field  Clayton always performed the oxygen analysis with a ruler  pocket calculator and a 1950s-era vacuum-tube mass spectrometer  now on display in the Henry Hinds Laboratory for Geophysical Sciences. For a quarter of a century  oxygen from virtually every new type of meteorite passed through that spectrometer as Clayton and Mayeda mapped out the isotope ratios for every class of meteorites.Clayton was also a pioneer in the field of stable isotope geothermometry  which is used in everything from reconstructing temperature changes over millennia as a stalactite forms to reconstructing the climate history of the Earth from polar ice cores. “Bob’s work to measure the distribution of oxygen isotopes between coexisting minerals was a major step in transforming stable isotope geothermometry into a quantitative science ” Davis said.His colleagues remembered Clayton as an unusually dedicated teacher  always impeccably dressed in a white shirt and tie  with a gift for making complex concepts sound simple and a passion for the fundamentals of chemistry. “He was a great scientist  but one of the underpinnings of his greatness was that he really  truly understood the fundamentals. That’s why he liked to teach first-year chemistry: Those undergrads will ask you questions you haven’t considered in 35 years ” Grossman said.His daily coffee breaks were a mainstay in the department for decades  drawing noted visitors and regular attendees for their intense scientific and non-scientific discussions. He served as chair of the Department of Geophysical Sciences from 1976-79  as director of the Enrico Fermi Institute from 1998-2001  and as master of the Division of the Physical Sciences' Collegiate Division and associate dean of the Division of the Physical Sciences from 1969-72.Even in official retirement  he continued to conduct research  meet with students and challenge the field: In 2002  he published a half-page statement inNature publically changing his mind on a longstanding argument about whether variability in oxygen isotopes was a result of early star formation or exposure to ultraviolet light. The paper predicted the sun would be five percent richer in oxygen-16 than the rest of the solar system—a finding that was confirmed by the Genesis spacecraft years later.Clayton was awarded the National Medal of Science  as well as the Geochemical Society’s Goldschmidt Medal  the Urey Medal of the European Association of Geochemistry  and the Meteoritical Society’s Leonard Medal  among others. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London  the Royal Society of Canada and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Clayton is survived by his wife Cathy  daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter Leonora.
                    Jonathan Z. Smith  celebrated historian of religion  1938-2017            ,Prof. Emeritus Jonathan Z. Smith  an influential historian of religion and a celebrated faculty member at the University of Chicago  passed away Dec. 30. He was 79.A member of the UChicago faculty for 45 years  Smith joined the Divinity School as an assistant professor in 1968. He became a professor in 1975  was named the Robert O. Anderson Distinguished Service Professorship in the Humanities in 1982 and retired in 2013. He also served as master of the Humanities Collegiate Division from 1974 to 1977 and as dean of the College from 1977 to 1982.Colleagues remembered him as a brilliant teacher  mentor  scholar and colleague who was passionate about the University of Chicago community and his field of study.“Jonathan Z. Smith was a quintessential Chicago scholar of indomitable intellectual energy and unforgettable wit  iconoclastic in the very best sense  and utterly dedicated to a life of learning and teaching—for himself  his students and for a civil society ” said Margaret M. Mitchell  the Shailer Mathews Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature and former dean of the Divinity School.“Generations of undergraduates knew Jonathan Z. Smith as a challenging  inspiring  uncompromising  witty and breathtakingly erudite teacher ” said Wendy Doniger  the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions in the Divinity School. “The wider world of religious studies knew him as the author of paradigms and theoretical formulations that changed the way we now study religion.”An early fascination with the relationship between myth and philosophy led Smith to an academic career examining the nature and history of religions across cultures—from Maori cults in the 19th century to the mass suicide in Jonestown  Guyana.“They’re interesting  in and of themselves ” Smith said in a 2008 interview with theChicago Maroon describing the religions he chose to study. “They relate to the world in which I live  but it’s like a funhouse mirror: Something’s off. It’s not quite the world I live in  yet it’s recognizable. So that gap interested me. And so I specialized in religions that are dead  which has the great advantage that nobody talks back.”Born in Brooklyn  N.Y.  Smith became interested in religion at a young age when he decided to abstain from eating meat and found defense for his choice through religious texts. As an undergraduate he was fascinated with the relationship between Greek philosophy and myth and was encouraged by a philosophy professor to attend Yale Divinity School  where he earned a PhD in 1969.Smith devoted his career to rigorous methodological research and drawing new understandings from disparate sources. For his scholarly work  Smith received numerous recognitions  including membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and he was the past president of the Society for Biblical Literature and the North American Association for the Study of Religion. In 2013 he earned an honorary lifetime membership in the International Association for the History of Religions.Smith was also a beloved teacher  and he received the University’s Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1986. Bruce Lincoln  the Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of the History of Religions in the Divinity School  recalled Smith’s brilliance in the classroom.“As a lecturer  he was absolutely spellbinding ” said Lincoln  one of Smith’s former graduate students. “In exchanges with students he was wonderfully encouraging  challenging and inspiring.”Smith is survived by his wife  Elaine B. Smith; children  Siobhan Smith and Jason Smith (Rachel Weaver); granddaughter  Hazel van Wijk; and sister  Pamela Hanson. There will be no funeral or memorial services.
                    Brian Baldea  associate director of athletics and longtime baseball coach  1955-2017            ,Brian Baldea  University of Chicago associate director of athletics and former head baseball coach  passed away Dec. 5 at the age of 62.Baldea was in his 28th year serving within UChicago Athletics & Recreation. He spent 24 seasons leading the Maroons baseball team from 1991 through 2014.At the helm of the Maroons  Baldea became the winningest baseball coach in the program’s 125-year history. His career record stands at 411-377-5. On April 28  2007  he surpassed Amos Alonzo Stagg as the school’s all-time leader in baseball victories with 281. Baldea's teams compiled 14 winning seasons and nine campaigns with at least 20 wins.UChicago’s greatest baseball success occurred under Baldea’s leadership. From 1996-98  the Maroons compiled three-straight 20-win seasons—a feat never before accomplished during the program’s previous 105 years of competition. His 2001 squad set a new school record for victories with a 26-8 mark. Over his final five years as a coach  the Maroons racked up 15 All-Region selections. Alumnus Mark Mosier was named to the all-America and academic all-America teams in 1997  and was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the Major League Baseball draft.In his role as associate athletic director  Baldea worked alongside Athletic Director Erin McDermott on strategic initiatives. Baldea oversaw the fitness and wellness programs and personnel  including the FitChicago program  personal training  and strength and conditioning  as well as the sports information and promotions office. Additionally  he helped coordinate enrichment programming for student-athletes and managed athletic facilities rentals.A Chicago native  Baldea attended Amos Alonzo Stagg High School in suburban Palos Hills. He earned his bachelor’s degree from North Park University in 1976  and his master’s degree from the University of Illinois in 1978.Before his arrival on the Hyde Park campus  Baldea was an assistant baseball coach at Illinois State University for seven years. While at ISU  he spent five years as head coach of a franchise in a summer collegiate league sanctioned by the NCAA and financed by Major League Baseball for the purpose of developing and showcasing college players who exhibit professional potential. Baldea's clubs won four consecutive league championships  and he recruited and coached approximately 40 players who went on to sign professional contracts.Visitation is scheduled for Dec. 9 from 4 to 9 p.m. at Thompson & Kuenster Funeral Home  5570 W. 95th St. in suburban Oak Lawn.—This story first appeared on the Athletics & Recreation website.
                    David L. Wallace  statistician who helped identify Federalist Papers authors  1928-2017            ,Prof. Emeritus David L. Wallace  a statistician who co-authored a book that revealed the answer to one of American history’s most enduring questions  died on Oct. 9. He was 88.Historians had puzzled over the authorship of 12 of the 85 Federalist Papers almost since they were written in 1788. Wallace and Prof. Frederick Mosteller of Harvard University applied statistical analysis and computational power to the problem  publishing their answer in 1964’sInference & Disputed Authorship: The Federalist.Their findings—that James Madison authored all 12—created a national stir  both for the answer and for how they put computers to work to arrive at it. Newspapers around the country The New York TimesandChicago Tribuneamong them  wrote about Wallace and Mosteller  as didTimemagazine.Much of the news coverage on the Federalist Papers focused on their early application of computational power to statistics  an area in which Wallace would remain influential. But their work also was the first full-scale applied statistical analysis done using Bayesian methods—statistical theory based on the work of statistician Thomas Bayes.“David Wallace’s study of the authorship of the Federalist Papers still stands among the best full-scale Bayesian statistical studies  and it has left a mark even as the profession has advanced  as an exemplar of what can be accomplished ” said Stephen M. Stigler  the Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago. “As a teacher and colleague he has shared deep insights into statistical methods  and those lessons are still being widely repeated several academic generations later.”Wallace also was part of a team that in the 1960s helped develop modern methods of forecasting election outcomes based on early results  and worked as part of NBC’s election coverage.Wallace joined the University in 1954 as an assistant professor. He remained at the University of Chicago until he retired in 1995  serving as chairman of the department from 1977 to 1980.Wallace’s students said he challenged and helped them  while leaving a vivid image of himself as the professor in the white lab coat.“He wore it to class to keep the chalk off his clothing  but we students didn't figure out that motivation until later  and it added to the mystique ” said Robert Kass  PhD’80  who is the Maurice Falk Professor of Statistics & Computational Neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon. “At a holiday party my first year I imitated David in a skit  and when I appeared in a lab coat  everyone immediately laughed.”Ted Karrison  PhD’85  a University of Chicago research professor who was among the 16 doctoral students advised by Wallace  called him a rigorous and insightful who was very generous with his time.“I recall very well that after our meetings  I would find in my mailbox notes and comments that he had written out just so I wouldn’t forget ” Karrison said.Wallace’s wife of 62 years  Anna Mary Wallace  said her “extraordinary husband” had a deep love of architecture  as well as the outdoors  leading his family on camping trips across the country.David L. Wallace is also survived by his brother  as well as three children and three grandchildren.
                    Michael Murrin  leading scholar of allegory and ‘dracologist ’ 1938–2021            ,Michael Murrin  a leading scholar of the genres of epic  romance and fantasy in the Western literary tradition  died July 27. He was 83.The Raymond W. and Martha Hilpert Gruner Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Humanities  Murrin was a treasured member of the University of Chicago faculty for 50 years.A specialist in the history of criticism and allegorical interpretation  Murrin traced the tessellations of reality and fantasy in medieval  Renaissance and early modern European literature. Throughout his career  he read original works in more than half a dozen languages—including Italian  Persian and Old Norse.Among his subjects of inquiry wereBeowulf  Edmund Spenser’sThe Faerie Queene  John Milton’sParadise Lost  J.R.R. Tolkien’sThe Lord of the Ringsand numerous other poems  books  myths and legends.Murrin sought to unveil the deeper meaning behind the symbols  tropes and mythical beasts that appeared in such works. As UChicago’s resident “dracologist ” or dragon expert  he introduced thousands of non-academic readers to his nuanced understanding of the creature’s enduring cultural potency.“Throw in a dragon  and you have an entirely different kind of fiction ” he told theWall Street Journal’s Fred Klein in 1974. “The reader is asked to take seriously a really irrational sort of creature. He has to cope with a whole series of problems he hadn’t considered before. And that  in fact  is what is continually happening to us.”According to Murrin  dragons are among the allegorical figures present in the fantasy genre that set it apart from other forms of storytelling. For example  Murrin argued that early Europeans did not believe in dragons in a literal sense  but that dragons served then—as now—as vivid  rich and complex symbols which could illuminate human concerns from economics (hoarding gold) to destruction and plague (fire or poison breathing).“Michael Murrin’s central question in his long career as a writer and teacher was always how  in different registers and scales  literary representation encounters a real that exceeds it ” said his longtime friend and colleague  Bradin Cormack  a professor of English at Princeton University.Murrin also studied the impact that early European trade in Asia and the Middle East had on the European imagination. By comparing maps and travelers’ accounts with texts  he elucidated the connections between reality and fantasy for his students.“In class  he would often trace the thread of a single literary reference through time ” said Rachel Eisendrath  PhD’12  one of Murrin’s last doctoral students and now an associate professor of English at Barnard College of Columbia University.“After immersion in what could seem like minutiae  he would help us look up and see the larger picture that had come into view—a picture of major intellectual shifts that had occurred over time. By his example  I learned that rigorous scholarly studies could be illuminated from within by wonder.”In addition to his primary appointment in the Department of English Language and Literature  Murrin held secondary appointments in the Departments of Comparative Literature and in the Divinity School.Born March 25  1938  in Minneapolis  he attended the College (now University) of St. Thomas and Yale University  where he received his Ph.D. in 1965. He began teaching at UChicago as an instructor in 1963  before he received his doctorate  and became an assistant professor two years later. In 1967  he won the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.Murrin would go on to spend his entire academic career at UChicago  where he was noted both for his scholarship and his gentle  engaging manner with students and colleagues. Many recalled the characteristic warmth and generosity he displayed during office hours  lunches and walks around campus.“Though decades have passed since I was his student  he is still teaching me ” said his former student  David Wilson-Okamura  AM’93  PhD’98  now a professor of English at East Carolina University. “In a lecture  he said that  while reason can destroy cherished illusions  it replaces them with something richer. I didn’t grasp that  not fully  but I wrote it down; and years later I understood. He was teaching us not to be afraid of truth  that it would somehow kill faith or ruin romance.”
                    Roscoe Braham Jr.  pioneering meteorologist  1921-2017            ,Prof. Emeritus Roscoe Braham Jr.  a noted expert in cloud precipitation physics who furthered weather research by combining the use of aircraft with ground-based instruments  died May 28 at the Glenaire Retirement Community in Cary  N.C. He was 96.“He was a giant of experimental meteorology and was one of the pioneers using aircraft for weather research ” said Prof. Andrew Davis  chair of the University of Chicago’s Department of Geophysical Sciences.Braham performed key research for The Thunderstorm Project  which operated from 1946 to 1949. A congressionally mandated  multi-agency program to improve aircraft safety in thunderstorms  the project was the nation’s first large-scale meteorological study.Braham’s participation in the project led to his discovery of the convection-cell organization of thunderstorms  and to his co-authorship ofThe Thunderstorm  a classic in the annals of meteorology. He is further noted for discovering the coalescence-freezing mechanism of precipitation in clouds.“The Thunderstorm Project was very significant ” said Frank Richter  the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in Geophysical Sciences at UChicago. “It merged technical developments—for example instrumented aircraft and radar—to promote basic scientific insights and use these to develop practical strategies that made very important contributions to aircraft safety.”These insights include recognition that radar could detect and guide aircraft around the most dangerous parts of thunderstorms.“Today this is routine ” Braham commented in 1996  “but we must recall that during World War II radar was new  highly classified and essentially limited to the military.”Braham also played a key role in promoting mutual respect between the faculties of the meteorology and geology departments at UChicago  which merged to become the department of geophysical sciences in 1961.“The merging of two historic and highly successful departments of meteorology and geology would require the joint faculty to surrender a certain amount of their professional identity  which was bound to create a certain amount of friction ” Richter said. “Roscoe Braham on the meteorology side and Julian Goldsmith from geology were the key persons who by their civility and intellectual tolerance turned what could have been a very fractured new department into one that became a model of a more holistic approach to the earth sciences.”Braham was born Jan. 3  1921  in Yates City  Ill. He earned his bachelor’s degree in geology from Ohio University in 1941. He married Mary Ann Moll in 1943 in Xenia  Ohio.During World War II  Braham served in the U.S. Army Air Corps  first as a weather officer  later as a bomber pilot. After his discharge in 1946  he entered graduate school at the University of Chicago to study cloud physics  earning his master’s degree in 1948 and his doctorate in 1951.“He always stressed the importance of education  calling education our meal ticket ” said his son  Richard Braham  a professor of forestry at North Carolina State University. Two of Roscoe Braham’s daughters  Ruth Ann and Nancy  became grade school and high school teachers. His third daughter  Jean  became a registered nurse.“His summer research locations were of necessity in areas largely removed from commercial airline traffic  allowing his plane to fly wherever needed ” Richard Braham recalled. “To keep the family together during the research season  the family would find a campground within commuting distance and set camp  often for as long as five to six weeks.”Braham retired from UChicago in 1991. He and his wife then moved to Cary  N.C.During his career Braham also served as a research meteorologist at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology  as founding director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona  and as a visiting scientist at North Carolina State University.Braham was a co-founder of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. UCAR manages NCAR under sponsorship from the National Science Foundation.He was author or co-author of more than 80 scientific reports  books and manuscripts.Braham had collected many honors during his career  including the Silver Medal from the U.S. Department of Commerce for his work on the Thunderstorm Project. He also received the Rossby Research Medal from the American Meteorological Society  the Losey Award from the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences and an honorary doctorate from North Carolina State University.Braham is survived by his wife  Mary Ann; daughters  Ruth Ann Ashton  Nancy Billingslea and Jean Barwig; son  Richard Braham; eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.Memorial services were held. Donations may be made to the Edith Braham Endowment  which supports meteorology collections at the North Carolina State University Libraries.
                    Philip Gossett  scholar of 19th-century Italian opera  1941–2017            ,Philip Gossett  an acclaimed musicologist and scholar of 19th-century Italian opera  died June 13 at his home in Hyde Park. He was 75.Gossett  the Robert W. Reneker Distinguished Service Emeritus Professor in Music at the University of Chicago  conducted exhaustive research of composers such as Giuseppe Verdi and Gioachino Rossini. His work included uncovering forgotten operatic compositions  editing critical editions on such works asLa gazzetta  and writing books  including the award-winningDivas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera.In a 2010 interview  Gossett said he hadn’t planned to study Italian opera. “I was thrown into it because I began looking at available sources for some of the music of Rossini  and I discovered that every single source that I looked at was different from every other source  and at a certain point I had to ask myself  ‘well what did the man actually write?’” he said.Born in New York  Gossett began studying piano at age five. During high school  he attended what is now Juilliard’s Pre-College Division. Gossett completed his undergraduate studies at Amherst College in music  having started in physics  and received his doctorate in musicology from Princeton University. He joined the University of Chicago in 1968.“I’ll always treasure the memory of Philip as a scholar’s scholar  a musician’s scholar and a public scholar—all in full and equal measure ” said Anne Robertson  dean of the Division of the Humanities and the Claire Dux Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Music and the Humanities.
                    Richard L. Baron  radiologist and authority on liver disease  1949-2017            ,Richard Baron  professor and former chairman of theDepartment of Radiologyat the University of Chicago  died suddenly while playing tennis on May 4. He was 68 years old.One of the world’s leading authorities on diagnostic imaging of liver disease  Baron enjoyed a distinguished career in research  education and patient care. He served as chairman of radiology at the University of Chicago from 2002 to 2011 as well as dean for clinical practice and head of the faculty practice plan from 2011 to 2013. Prior to that  Baron was chairman of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh and founding president and CEO of the University of Pittsburgh Physicians.He also served on the board of theRadiological Society of North Americafrom 2008 to 2016 and as president of the board for 2015 to 2016. At the time of his death  he was a member of the American College of Radiology’s board of chancellors and a past president of both the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiology and the Society of Computed Body Tomography and Magnetic Resonance.“The radiology faculty benefitted during his chairmanship  from his thoughtful guidance and his ability and eagerness to mentor younger colleagues ” recalled David Paushter  who succeeded Baron as chairman of radiology at the University of Chicago. “He was a master educator and a lifelong learner—a role model for trainees and clinical peers alike.”Baron published more than 150 peer-reviewed scientific articles  53 book chapters and review articles  and was co-editor of the textbookMultislice-CT of the Abdomen. He provided quality and safety expertise on national and international levels  serving on the Joint Commission Professional Technical Advisory Committee from 2007 to 2011 and providing guidance to the International Atomic Energy Commission and the World Health Organization. He was a popular speaker  presenting hundreds of invited lectures throughout the world.He served as a reviewer for several journals  includingRadiology  The American Journal of Roentgenology  The Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography  Liver Transplantation  Gastroenterology  and European Radiology  and was an associate editor ofRadiologyfrom 1991 to 1996 and ofLiver Transplantationfrom 2004 to 2009.“He was a master educator and a lifelong learner—a role model for trainees and clinical peers alike.”Prof. David PaushterHe earned international honors for his research and teaching—noteworthy among these awards were the Gold Medal of the Asian Oceanian Society of Radiology in 2014  the Medal of Honor and honorary membership in the French Radiological Society in 2015  and honorary membership in the European Society of Radiology in 2017.Despite steady international recognition  one of his most urgent  high-profile investigations was close to home. On June 4  2003  the Baseball Hall of Fame askedBaron to perform diagnostic X-rayson the two bats that Cubs player Sammy Sosa had used  one to hit his 500th home run and one for home runs 64  65 and 66 in 1998. There was reason for suspicion: Sosa had been caught the day before using a corked bat.“The Hall of Fame wanted to hear good news ” Baron said at the time. “There was tension  but we could tell right away that the bats were clean. The baseball people were quite relieved.”But  ever meticulous  Baron wasn’t done. The X-rays were persuasive  but in this case  absolute certainty required a CT scan. Fortunately  one scan of both bats quickly confirmed the benign diagnosis.Richard Lewis Baron was born March 11  1949  in Springfield  Mass. He graduatedcum laudefrom Yale University in 1972 and earned his medical degree and election to the student honor societyAlpha Omega Alphaat the Washington University School of Medicine in 1976. His internship in internal medicine at Yale University was followed by a residency in radiology and an abdominal radiology fellowship at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University. Later in his career  faced with increasing administrative duties  he pursued further education in the MBA program at the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh.A mentor and family man“He was a mentor so many people  residents as well as senior faculty ” recalled colleague and close friend Stephen Montner  professor of radiology. “The people he worked with tended to become close friends. As a leader  he was firm but very fair. He was warm and generous with his friends and colleagues  who soon became friends. And I have to say  he always took the side of right. I never met a man with so much integrity.”“He will be greatly missed ” said Valerie P. Jackson  chair of the Radiological Society of North America’s Board of Directors. She described Baron as an “internationally respected abdominal imaging radiologist and an outstanding administrator ” adding that he was also “humble  kind-hearted and always willing to mentor others.”“Although Rich was recognized internationally as a gifted leader  educator  physician and scientist  his peers tend to focus on his altruism and mentorship ” said Paushter. “This matches my experience. He was a thoughtful friend who helped guide colleagues and trainees through the difficult decisions of academic medicine  telling us to ‘take the high road ’ which he always did. He was the same with patients  placing them at the epicenter of his professional universe  long before it came into vogue.”Despite the demands of his career  “the man that we knew at home was totally devoted to his family ” said his wife  Shirley Baron. “His focus was never on himself but rather on those he loved. We knew him as warm  loving  patient  generous and always available when needed.”“He brought his energy for fun and his enthusiasm to the smallest of tasks of everyday life ” she added  “including cooking with me or just doing errands together. Richard was passionate about travel  skiing  tennis  and photography  which he loved to share with the rest of us. He was ‘all in’ when something was important to him.”“He was also a great dad ” she said  “consistent in his messages. ‘Do your best ’ he told his children. ‘Nobody can ask for more than that.’ The basic message was: ‘Try hard; take your time; don't give up; I'm here for you.’”Baron is survived by his wife Shirley Baron; their son  Tim Baron; daughter  Christine Turner; and Baron’s brother John.In lieu of flowers  the Baron family requests that donations in memory of Richard Baron be made to the RSNA Research & Education Foundation  to support a young radiology researcher in abdominal imaging.—This story first appeared on the ScienceLife blog.
                    David Rockefeller  University trustee and descendent of UChicago’s philanthropic founder  1915-2017            ,David Rockefeller  PhD’40  a prominent philanthropist  banking executive and University trustee whose grandfather  John D. Rockefeller Sr.  was the philanthropic founder of the University of Chicago  died on March 20. He was 101.Rockefeller’s ties to the University spanned a lifetime  from touring Egypt and the Middle East as a teenager with distinguished University archaeologist James Henry Breasted to the endowment of a professorship in UChicago’s economics department  from which he received his doctorate. Rockefeller was associated with the University’s Board of Trustees for seven decades  providing a strong connection to the institution’s founding in 1890.David Rockefeller was a leader in finance as chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank and was a prominent philanthropist  serving as chairman of such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art  the Council on Foreign Relations and Rockefeller University. His global work included the founding the Trilateral Commission  a non-partisan group to foster closer cooperation between the North America  Europe and Asia  and providing leadership and support for the International House Association  including International House at the University of Chicago.“David Rockefeller led a truly remarkable life  characterized by his keen intellect  an understanding of global issues and a deep appreciation of the responsibility that his family’s legacy had given him ” said President Robert J. Zimmer. “He was a generous supporter of the University and offered the benefit of his experience and good judgment. He will be remembered here for his prominent role in the University’s history.”Rockefeller was born in New York City on June 12  1915 to John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He attended the Lincoln School in Harlem  which featured progressive teaching methods influenced by John Dewey. As a child and young man he knew his grandfather  the former leader of Standard Oil  who was one of the most influential corporate figures and philanthropists in American history  but whom David Rockefeller knew as a “benign  indulgent” patriarch who gave out dimes to children. “He was the least dour man I have ever known; he was constantly smiling  joking and telling shaggy dog stories ” David Rockefeller wrote in his 2003 book Memoirs.Rockefeller remembered a youth filled with art and travel. In 1929  at age 14  Rockefeller and members of his family toured Egypt and the Middle East at the invitation of Breasted  whose work fascinated Rockefeller’s father. Such excursions “made us feel the excitement of the opportunities open to us and recognize the role the family was playing in so many areas. These experiences gave us an education that transcended formal learning ” Rockefeller wrote about the experience.Rockefeller graduated from Harvard College in 1936  and after a year at the London School of Economics  arrived at UChicago to pursue a PhD. The school “boasted one of the premier economics faculties in the world…the fact that Grandfather had helped found the university played a distinctly secondary role in my choice ” he recalled. His thesis  “Unused Resources and Economic Waste ” was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1940.“David was proud of his Chicago degree and spoke often of his admiration for the great economists he had encountered here ” said President Emeritus Hanna Holborn Gray. “He liked to reminisce about his boyhood trip with James Henry Breasted  which happened as the Oriental Institute and Chicago House in Luxor  Egypt became objects of the Rockefeller family’s philanthropy.”While working on his dissertation  Rockefeller met Margaret “Peggy” McGrath. The couple were married for 55 years until McGrath’s death in 1996.Service and leadership on a global stageAfter completing his graduate work  Rockefeller began in government service  working for New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. During World War II  he served as an intelligence officer in North Africa and the south of France  achieving the rank of captain. With the return of peace  Rockefeller embarked on his career at Chase Manhattan and worked to continue his family’s tradition of philanthropy—what John D. Rockefeller Sr. called “the art of giving.” He was first elected as a trustee of the University of Chicago on May 8  1947. He served as a trustee until 1963  became an honorary trustee until 1966  then was a life trustee until 2007 and was a trustee emeritus at the time of his death.Rockefeller became chairman and chief executive of Chase  where he focused on global banking and developed important relationships with numerous world leaders. He was part of a generation of Rockefellers who held a prominent place in American civic life. His brother Nelson Rockefeller was governor of New York and later vice president of the United States  while his brother Winthrop Rockefeller served as governor of Arkansas.David Rockefeller’s civic work included helping New York City through its financial crisis  serving as a key supporter of New York’s Museum of Modern Art  and leading Rockefeller University as chairman of its board of trustees. His many years of service to educational  civic and cultural institutions earned Rockefeller honors  including the U.S. Legion of Merit  the French Legion of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Gray said that when Rockefeller retired from Chase  the bank’s board decided to honor him by endowing a chair in his honor  rather than through a direct gift — after all  “what could you give a Rockefeller?”There was a competition between Harvard and the University of Chicago for the chair  which was to be in international economics. Chicago won  and Rockefeller came for the announcement and dinner that inaugurated the chair. “He always remained interested in following its progress and learning of its incumbents ” Gray said.The chair is now held by Nobel laureate Lars Hansen  the David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor in Economics.John W. Boyer  dean of the College and author ofThe University of Chicago: A History said David Rockefeller valued what his family had begun at the University of Chicago  and he contributed to its later successes.“David Rockefeller served with great distinction as an active trustee of the University  as a generous philanthropist in support of the University’s academic programs and as a wise adviser to several of our presidents ” Boyer said. “The gifts of his grandfather  John D. Rockefeller Sr.  to the early University of Chicago were primarily responsible for the founding of one of the great new research universities in modern America  setting a model for those who would follow in advancing the well-being of American higher education and society. David Rockefeller shared with his grandfather and his father a deep conviction about the profound responsibilities that the great American universities bear in enhancing the intellectual creativity and cultural progress of American civic life.”Rockefeller is survived by five of his children  David Rockefeller Jr.  Abigail Rockefeller  Neva Rockefeller Goodwin  Peggy Dulany and Ellen Rockefeller Growald. He was preceded in death by his son Richard Rockefeller.
                    Robert Gomer  chemist  longtime teacher and cherished colleague  1924-2016            ,Prof. Emeritus Robert Gomer  a chemical physicist who pioneered techniques for studying molecules and taught at the University of Chicago for nearly a half-century  died Dec. 12 of complications related to Parkinson’s disease. He was 92.In his research  Gomer studied the emission  diffusion and absorption of atoms and molecules on ultraclean surfaces. That work started  Gomer once wrote  “after hearing a seminar account of E.W. Muller’s field emission microscope. I built one and became active in developing this instrument as a tool for surface studies.”Gomer was a pioneer in the modern discipline of surface physics and chemistry  said Steven Sibener  the Carl William Eisendrath Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry and the James Franck Institute. “His lifelong work on the surface diffusion of atoms and adsorbates on metallic surfaces represent research that has withstood the test of time  and provided foundational information for the generations of researchers that followed in his areas of interest.”Gomer first came to the University in 1950 as an instructor in the Department of Chemistry and theJames Franck Institute. He served as director of the James Franck Institute from 1977 to 1983 and was named the Carl W. Eisendrath Distinguished Service Professor in 1984.“Chicago offered a sense of belonging and a sense of being a part  however modestly  of a great adventure ” Gomer once wrote. Richard Gomer said his father will be fondly remembered for his collegiality.“He viewed his colleagues and students as family ” said Richard Gomer  a professor of biology at Texas A&M University. “He loved having lunch with chemists and physicists daily at the Quad Club. It was a real meeting of the minds  but one that would often end with a game of billiards.”After Gomer became a professor emeritus in 1996  he and his wife  Ann  organized regular interdisciplinary talks for faculty in their Hyde Park home. “This is the institution that became  about five years ago  the Robert and Ann Gomer lecture series  which I chair and which meets about six times a year ” said David Bevington  the Phyllis Fay Horton Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus. “Bob was a true inspiration to us all and will be greatly missed.”Gomer approached science and research “as a contest with nature ” said Lanny Schmidt  Gomer’s former student and now a professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota. “He personalized every problem in a way that made it fun to do research. The tedious tasks were still part of the overall contest.“One time we were working on an intricate spot-welding problem ” Schmidt added. “Upon completion Bob said  ‘Now we’ve got Mother Nature right where we want her!’”Richard Gomer recalls that his father was a tough grader who wasn’t afraid to give out Ds and Fs. “His only reason for doing this was to set high standards  as he always did for himself  as well as for others ” he said. “This inspired many people to pursue research. He spent a minimal amount of time in his office; he was constantly working in the lab.”Critic of nuclear weaponsBorn in Vienna  Austria in 1924  Gomer went to England in 1938 as a refugee child  came to the United States in 1940 and went to Pomona College. After serving in the U.S. Army  he received his PhD in chemistry at the University of Rochester in 1949.Gomer was an outspoken opponent of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He was a regular contributor to and chaired the editorial board of theBulletin of Atomic Scientists  a journal founded byManhattan Projectphysiciststhat covers policy issues related to the dangers of nuclear weapons.In 1966  Gomer was one of four scientists who wrote a classified report for the Department of Defense about the potential use of nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. “Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia” concluded that such strikes would be catastrophic for U.S. global interests. “It was our purpose to show that using nuclear weapons would be an immoral folly and set an awful precedent ” Gomer said.Gomer was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1981. He was an Atomic Energy Commission Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow at UChicago. He also was a Guggenheim fellow at the University of Paris  and a Fulbright fellow at the Technical University of Vienna.He won several awards  including the Bourke Lecturer from the Faraday Society  the Kendall Award in Colloid or Surface Science from the American Chemical Society  the Senior U.S. Scientist Award from the A. von Humboldt Society  and the Davisson-Germer Prize in Surface Physics from the American Physical Society.He wroteField Emission and Field Ionization(1961) and edited several scientific journals  includingApplied Physics.“We shared many conversations on the nature of atomic-level dynamics at interfaces ” Sibener said. “This topic and associated scientific advances remain at the forefront of science today  contributing many crucial ideas to what is now popularly referred to as the field of nanoscience.”Gomer is survived by his wife  Anne; son Richard; daughter  Maria Luczkow; and grandchildren Katie  Anna and Julia.
                    Janellen Huttenlocher  pioneering scholar in childhood development  1932–2016               ,Janellen Huttenlocher  a pioneer in the field of childhood development whose research explored how children acquire language  understand space and learn math  died Nov. 20 in Chicago. She was 84.The William S. Gray Professor Emeritus in Psychology  Huttenlocher was a researcher  teacher and mentor at the University of Chicago for four decades. Her research delved into a broad range of topics such as categorization  spatial coding and memory—themes scholars continue to explore. It was marked by groundbreaking work on the role of environment in the development of language skills  including the importance of parents talking to their young children often and in complex sentences.“Janellen was a big ideas person and had a lot of influence because of that ” said Susan Levine  the Rebecca Anne Boylan Professor of Education and Society  who worked closely with Huttenlocher. “She was a pioneer in early childhood research  including her work on language development and the effects of parents.”Huttenlocher’s impact in the field of psychology included co-authoring the booksMaking Space: The Development of Spatial Representation and ReasoningandQuantitative Development in Infancy and Early Childhood  as well as publishing hundreds of research articles. Her scholarship spanned 60 years from her first publication in 1956 to her last in 2015.Her work on the role of environment in the development of language skills carry on through a multi-year project at UChicago on children and language funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The group of researchers includes Levine  Susan Goldin-Meadow  the Beardsley Ruml Distinguished Service Professor; Stephen Raudenbush  the Lewis-Sebring Distinguished Service Professor; and Assoc. Prof. Lindsey Richland.Kelly Mix  AM’93  PhD’95  a former student of Huttenlocher’s who is chair of the Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology at the University of Maryland  said Huttenlocher’s research explored a broad range of topics  but was always marked by a common-sense elegance that provided simple explanations about how children develop.“I learned so much from watching how she thought about things  how she tackled problems ” Mix said. “Janellen would always say  ‘We came for the truth.’ She didn’t want the data to support what she already was thinking  but rather  reveal what was actually happening.”‘An eye on both adult and kid’Huttenlocher was born in Buffalo  N.Y. in 1932. She received her undergraduate education at the University of Buffalo and married Peter Huttenlocher shortly after graduating. The couple  which their family described as best friends  collaborated on research at UChicago  where Peter was a renowned neuroscientist  pediatric neurologist and professor.Janellen Huttenlocher came to UChicago in 1974 after earnings a master’s and doctorate at Harvard University and serving as a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University.Over the next four decades  her research explored many topics  including early mathematical thinking in children from different socioeconomic groups and the relationship between exposure and vocabulary and syntactic growth. Her work on mathematical development showed that children form mental models of sets and set transformations  and that learning of number words propelled their understanding. She also found that nonverbal mathematical thinking was much more similar across socioeconomic groups than verbal mathematical thinking.With respect to language  Huttenlocher found that the more a parent spoke to a child  the more the child’s vocabulary grew. Her research also found that speaking in complex sentences rather than simple ones is important for the development of children’s language comprehension.More broadly  Huttenlocher’s work challenged the idea a child’s ability to learn is driven primarily by inherited traits. In one example  her research found that children’s ability to learn fluctuates depending on whether they were spending time in school during the school year or out of school during the summer months. The work was cited as an argument for year-round schooling.“She was really ahead of her time in wanting to understand childhood development and adult cognition ” said Nora Newcombe  the Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology at Temple University  who collaborated with Huttenlocher in researching spatial development and spatial cognition. “She always kept an eye on both adult and kid. Even today they are very separate worlds.”Besides her prolific career as a researcher  Huttenlocher helped draw top psychology scholars to UChicago and mentored and taught many students  influencing new generations of psychologists who are on the faculty at universities and colleges across the country. Even into retirement  she remained an active research collaborator and frequently attended colloquia and the weekly developmental seminar in UChicago’s Department of Psychology.Newcombe described Huttenlocher as having a keen mind and a love of classical music and the arts. She also was deeply devoted to her children.Huttenlocher waspreceded in death by her husband. She is survived by her children: Daniel  Anna and husband Andrew  Carl and wife Tami  and six grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Jan. 28 at Montgomery Place  5550 S. Shore Drive  Chicago. In lieu of flowers  donations can be made to the University of Chicago Department of Psychology.
                    Charles E. Bidwell  scholar who studied sociology of education  1932-2016            ,Charles E. Bidwell  an influential sociologist and former chair of the Departments of Education and Sociology at the University of Chicago  died Nov. 6. He was 84.Bidwell  AB’50  AM’53  PhD’56  whose time as student and teacher at the University spanned seven decades  was the William Claude Reavis Professor Emeritus. His research focused on the organization of educational institutions and how decisions are made  from the classroom to the community level. He chaired the Department of Education for a decade and later chaired the Department of Sociology. Bidwell also served as editor of theAmerican Journal of SociologyandAmerican Journal of Education.“Charles Bidwell influenced the thinking of a generation of sociology of education scholars in significant ways ” said Sara Ray Stoelinga  AB’95  PhD’04  the Sara Liston Spurlark Director of the Urban Education Institute and a former student of Bidwell. “But the essence of Charles to me were the values he brought to his daily work: his deep commitment to the mentoring of students and faculty  his integrity and high standards  and his kindness.”Bidwell’s son Charles L. Bidwell said his father’s interest in sociology took root while a student at the University’s Laboratory Schools when he did a project on the Tennessee Valley Authority. As a boy  Charles remembers driving around Chicago with his father  who would tell him stories about the neighborhoods and how they were changing.“He was best storyteller I ever knew ” Charles said. “My Dad was fascinated by people and so intrigued by the way the city developed  its ethnic mix and all the standards  practices and values that groups brought to the city and how they interacted and mixed.”Bidwell was born on Jan. 24  1932 in Chicago. His initial connection to the University was through his mother  Eugenia Bidwell  who was a graduate of the Class of 1924. He graduated from the Laboratory Schools and enrolled at the University as a 14-year-old under a program created by then-President Robert M. Hutchins.Bidwell received his bachelor’s degree in 1950 followed by a master’s and a doctorate from the University in 1953 and 1956  respectively. He was drafted in 1957 and spent two years as a researcher and speechwriter in Army headquarters in Washington  D.C.  where he met his wife Helen. Bidwell was recruited to Harvard University by famed sociologist Talcott Parsons. But after two years there  he found the lure of Chicago to be strong and joined UChicago in 1961 as an assistant professor.Bidwell spent the next four decades at the University. Edward O. Laumann  the George H. Mead Distinguished Service Professor of Sociology  remembered his friend as incredibly bright and curious. He loved debating ideas  but never raised his voice and was the consummate gentleman.“He was an exemplar of much of what we talk about today at the University around diversity  freedom of inquiry  and a willingness to pursue ideas and not celebrate petty wins ” Laumann said. “In his work  Charles was interested in trying to understand something so people could make it more successful  more effective.”Bidwell’s scholarship has had considerable influence on the sociology of education  beginning with his seminal 1965 chapter The School as a Formal Organization. Drawing upon and extending Willard Waller’sSociology of Teaching  Bidwell built a series of scholarly works which sought to understand the motivations of the variety of actors in and around schools within the layered contexts of classrooms  schools  districts and the larger society. His work is known for its attention to micro-level factors  mechanisms that shape organizational behavior and evolution  and broad theoretical applications to other organizational forms.Bidwell’s work reignited interest in the application of formal organizational theory to schools  influencing the thinking of a generation of scholars focused on the sociology of education. Later in his career  Bidwell extended his exploration of the formal organization of the school into inquiries that considered the work of teachers within schools and classrooms in more detail  drawing upon a variety of methods from grounded theory  to qualitative data collection  to social network analysis.Bidwell shaped the Department of Education after the closure of the University’s School of Education  recruiting and retaining top scholars as chairman. He presided over the hiring of professors in economics  sociology  psychology and statistics  seeking a comprehensive research approach to education. He executed a similar strategy in the Department of Sociology  hiring six faculty who became the core of a new generation of Chicago sociology.Bidwell was deeply involved as a teacher and mentor  chairing 39 dissertations and serving on another 30 committees in sociology alone. His students teach at major universities and serve in research centers focused on education.Bidwell’s honors included the American Sociological Association’s Willard Waller Award  which recognizes distinguished scholarly contributions to the field of sociology of education.Bidwell is survived by his son and daughter-in-law Rebecca Mullen and two grandchildren  Andrew and Emma. He is preceded in death by his wife. A memorial service will be held at a later date.
                    Isaac Abella  physicist  teacher and resident master  1934-2016            ,Prof. Emeritus Isaac Abella  a popular teacher  cherished resident master and noted physicist who worked on the early development of lasers  died Oct. 23 in Chicago of complications related to cancer. He was 82.Abella taught at the University of Chicago for nearly five decades and was a longtime resident master at the Shoreland residence hall. As a physicist  he specialized in laser physics  quantum optics and spectroscopy of rare-Earth laser materials. While an accomplished scholar  his first love was teaching and mentoring students.“Teaching was his forte  and mentoring undergraduate students is what he would be the proudest of ” said his son Benjamin Abella  an associate professor and physician at the University of Pennsylvania. “He made his classroom like a conversation. He was almost gleeful in his desire to share stories and engage students. That was his magic.”At UChicago  Prof. Henry J. Frisch remembered how he and Abella discussed ways to teach physics topics  such as the concept of special relativity or the Coriolis force  which describes the effect of Earth’s rotation on the motion of terrestrial objects.He made his classroom like a conversation. He was almost gleeful in his desire to share stories and engage students. That was his magic.Benjamin Abella on his father  Prof. Emeritus Isaac Abella“He cared deeply about transmitting the essence of the physics ” Frisch said. “He was a very popular and successful teacher who was extremely interested in pedagogy.”Abella and his wife  Mary Ann Abella  were resident masters for 16 years at Shoreland  serving as mentors and hosting events from pizza parties in the dorm to field trips to the Lyric Opera.Katie Callow-Wright  UChicago’s vice president and chief of staff in the Office of President  met the Abellas in 2000 when she moved into the Shoreland as assistant director of housing. She described the couple as a “force of nature” at Abella’s memorial service on Oct. 26 at Congregation Rodfei Zedek in Hyde Park.“I became part of the well-organized machine the Abellas had created to support the engaged  interesting  complex community they fostered so thoughtfully as resident masters of the Shoreland ” she said.Abella was born in Toronto  Canada in 1934. He earned a bachelor of arts in physics and astronomy from the University of Toronto in 1957  and then earned a master’s and doctorate in physics from Columbia University.While at Columbia  he worked under Nobel laureate Charles H. Townes  conducting research on early lasers. His thesis is among the earliest works on two-photon absorption. He wroteSome Properties of Ruby Optical Masers with Applications to Non-Linear Effects which was published in 1963.Abella started teaching at UChicago in 1965. He won the Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1969.During his career  Abella was a fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder  Colo.; a visiting scientist at the Optical Sciences Division of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington  D.C.; a guest scientist at the National Bureau of Standards at the Boulder Laboratories; and research fellow at Argonne National Laboratory.He has served on the Education Committee of the American Physical Society; chaired APS’ Education Committee of Laser Science Topical Group; and chaired APS’s Frank Isakson Prize for Optical Effects in Solids Committee. He was elected fellow of the APS  fellow of the Optical Society and president of the Chicago Chapter of Sigma Xi. In addition  Abella was a member of the National Research Council’s National Science Standards Working Group  which published the K-12 National Science Standards in 1996.Abella was a member of the National Academy of Sciences’ Committee on Undergraduate Science Education  which addressed science literacy in the United States. He was also a member of the NAS Mathematics (K-12) Standards Review Committee on behalf of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. He also played a big role in University of Chicago’s Physics Department Teaching Activities Committee.Abella retired from the University in 2011.Abella was a frequent writer of letters to the editor. One printed in theNew York Timesin 1992 addressed the physics behind conspiracy theories regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It attracted quite a bit of attention  including Abella being interviewed on a TV program hosted by Penn & Teller  a comedy duo who were taking a skeptical look at conspiracy theories.Abella is survived by his son  Benjamin; daughter  Sarah Abella; brother  Jack Abella; sister  Bracha Glass; and his six grandchildren: Lillie  Hannah  Sam  Max  Asher and Avi. He was preceded in death by his wife  Mary Ann.
                    Phil C. Neal  former Law School dean  1919-2016            ,FormerUniversity of Chicago Law SchoolDean Phil C. Neal  an antitrust expert  litigator and law firm founder whose ability to cut through complexity earned him a reputation as a deft problem-solver  died Sept. 27. He was 97.Neal was a professor at the Law School for 21 years starting in 1961 and served as its sixth dean between 1963 and 1975. He taught a wide range of subjects  including elements of the law  antitrust and constitutional law. As dean  he hired many influential scholars  including Richard Posner  now a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals; the late Ronald Coase  the 1991 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics; Gerhard Casper  Norval Morris  Frank Zimring  William Landes and Geoffrey R. Stone.Neal began a new phase of his long career as senior partner atNeal Gerber Eisenberg  the Chicago-based law firm he helped found in 1986. During his time in private practice  Neal litigated cases on a wide range of issues  from antitrust to school desegregation  and advised the corporate boards of major companies. In the 1950s and 1960s  Neal was appointed to several high-profile government bodies  serving as chairman of the Pacific Regional Enforcement Commission of the Wage Stabilization Board  executive secretary of the Coordinating Committee for Multi-District Litigation for the United States District Courts and chair of a White House task force on antitrust policy.“Phil Neal led an exceptional career of service and responsibility ” said Dean Thomas J. Miles  the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Law and Economics. “He was one of our longest-serving deans  and he led the Law School during a time of extraordinary change for our country and the legal profession. The Law School is forever better thanks to his leadership. Were that not enough  he was an elite practitioner  served in multiple high-level positions in the government  and even founded a major law firm. His career is a model of leadership for all lawyers.”Neal was an agile thinker who could“untangle Gordian knots where others were just sort of lost ” said his son  Andrew Neal. “He was very intelligent  quick-witted and didn’t suffer fools gladly. But he was also incredibly gracious  and very deliberate and thoughtful in the way he approached problems—life problems or legal problems—and he would not stand pat on whatever the thinking of the day was about anything.”This enabled Neal to “see the core simplicity” in even the most complex issues  said Stephen Fedo  JD’81  Neal Gerber Eisenberg’s general counsel and former student of Neal’s.“He was brilliant at cutting away the underbrush from an issue  and he was wonderful at articulating the simple truth of a problem in the most simple  elegant prose I’ve ever read ” Fedo said. “His real strength  as a lawyer and as a friend  is that he was always present when he spoke to you. His focus was on that person’s concerns  and on finding a way to address those concerns.”Neal  who was born in Chicago and graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in 1936  received his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from Harvard in 1940  and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1943. While in law school  Neal was president of theHarvard Law Review.After law school  Neal served for two years as a law clerk to Justice Robert H. Jackson of the U.S. Supreme Court. He joined the faculty at Stanford Law School in 1948 after working at a law firm in San Francisco for several years. While at Stanford  Neal introduced Jackson to a student named William H. Rehnquist  who would also serve as his law clerk. Rehnquist was one of two future U.S. Supreme Court justices whom Neal taught at Stanford; the other was Sandra Day O’Connor.Roberta Cooper Ramo  JD’67  who was a student during Neal’s deanship  cited him as having played a pivotal role as she broke through gender barriers in the legal profession. Ramo—the first woman president of the American Bar Association and the first woman president of the American Law Institute—recalled Neal’s support as she accepted the ABA Medal  the group’s highest honor  last year.“In 1967 when I couldn't find anyone who would even answer my letters as [my husband and I] were about to move to North Carolina … [Dean Neal] called me in to find out why I didn’t have a job ” she said. “When I explained  without hesitation and with me sitting right there  he picked up the phone and called [former North Carolina] Gov. Terry Sanford  who just stepped down from the governorship. He demanded that Gov. Sanford personally take on the job of finding me some place to work  posthaste. And out of fear of Phil Neal  he did.”Even during his years in private practice  Neal stayed on top of what was happening at the Law School and the University of Chicago.“He cherished his years at the Law School  and it was always in his heart ” his son Andrew Neal said. “He was very invested in the whole University and remained so until the end of his life.”Neal is survived by his wife  Linda Thoren Neal  JD’67; three sons  Stephen (Michelle S. Rhyu)  Timothy (Laurie) and Andrew (Holly A. Harrison); 13 grandchildren; and one great-grandson. He was preceded in death by his son Richard  who died in 2015.A memorial celebration will be held at 4 p.m. on Dec. 5  in the Glen Lloyd Auditorium of the University of Chicago Law School. In lieu of flowers gifts may be made to scholarship funds at The University of Chicago Law School or Music of the Baroque.—Article originally appeared on the University of Chicago Law School website.

                    Noel Swerdlow  one of the ‘greatest scholars’ of the history of science  1941-2021            ,Prof. Emeritus Noel M. Swerdlow  a distinguished historian of science and the world’s foremost expert on Ptolemy and Copernicus  died July 24. He was 79.Swerdlow was famous for his approach to studying the works of ancient scientists  which held that modern scholars should be able to understand the mathematics used by ancient writers—from the Babylonians to Kepler. His translations of and commentary on 16th-century astronomer Copernicus  and other astronomers from antiquity to the Renaissance  are foundational texts still read around the world.“Swerdlow was fiercely committed to the principle that understanding the history of the exact sciences required an uncompromising commitment to engaging in their detailed technical aspects ” said Adrian Johns  the Allan Grant Maclear Professor of History and Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science at UChicago. “His extensive publications attested to the determination and rigor with which he himself pursued those aspects  in subjects ranging from Babylonian astronomy to the harmony of the spheres.“With his death the history of science loses one of its greatest scholars—his expertise will be hard indeed for future generations in the field to regain—but also a figure of ardent scholarly conviction."Born on Sept. 12  1941 and raised in Los Angeles  Swerdlow received his B.A. in history in 1964 from the University of California  Los Angeles  and a Ph.D. in medieval studies in 1968 from Yale University. Though he began his graduate studies intending to focus on medieval music  he was gradually lured to the study of the history of science  finding both to be similarly mathematical disciplines.He joined the history department at the University of Chicago as an assistant professor in 1968  and moved to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1982  where he remained until his retirement in 2010.“He could take some classical astronomer—who might be a Babylonian who wrote on clay tablets  not just Galileo or Kepler—and dig into the mathematics they were using in order to understand it at the deepest possible level: how they did it and how they were thinking about the measurements ” said Prof. Rich Kron  a longtime colleague of Swerdlow’s in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. “He was a class by himself.”Swerdlow’s research focused on the history of the mathematical and astronomical sciences from antiquity through the 17th century  becoming the world’s leading authority on the technical aspects of Copernicanism and astronomical mathematics in the Renaissance.Swerdlow wanted not just to translate these ancient scholars’ work  but to bring it into context with the mathematics  instruments  observations and data they would have been using; this fed into a larger movement in the history of science in the past half-century to recreate the tools with which past scientists studied the natural world. When it awarded him a fellowship in 1988  the MacArthur Foundation wrote  “His mastery of the technical thinking of these eras has been invaluable in integrating a highly specialized field into broader historical  scientific  and philosophical discourse.”His works includea 1973 translation and explorationof Copernicus’s early astronomical work The Commentariolus; andMathematical Astronomy in Copernicus’s De Revolutionibus(1984)  a two-volume treatise co-written with Otto Neugebauer on mathematics in the works of Copernicus. That work earned him and Neugebauer the Pfizer Prize  the highest book award given by the History of Science Society.Swerdlow also authoredThe Babylonian Theory of the Planets(1998). Several colleagues are planning to complete and publish his last work The Renaissance of Astronomy in the Age of Humanism.
                    Menachem Brinker  Hebrew studies scholar and activist  1935-2016            ,Prof. Emeritus Menachem Brinker was known for his pioneering scholarship on philosophy and Hebrew literature as well as the relationships between philosophy  literature and society. The University’s first Henry Crown Professor of Modern Hebrew Language and Literature in Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations  he established the Modern Hebrew Language and Literature program at UChicago in 1995 and held the first chair in the program.The noted Hebrew scholar  Israel Prize laureate and peace activist died Aug. 11 of pancreatic cancer at his home in Jerusalem. He was 81.In 2004 he was awarded the Israel Prize—the most highly regarded award in Israel—for Hebrew and general literary research. He was the author of numerous books; among them the authoritative work on Yosef Haim Brenner a Russian pioneer of modern Hebrew literature. He divided his time between Chicago and Hebrew University until his 2005 retirement  when he returned to Israel.Brinker also was a prominent political activist who was one of the first to advocate for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He co-founded the critical literary and political review magazine EMDA (Hebrew for “position  opinion  policy”) and was its first editor. Then he co-founded Peace Now and was one of the leaders of the organization  Israel’s pre-eminent peace movement  well into the 1980s and ‘90s.“He was a voice of sanity relating to Israel ” said Josef Stern  the William H. Colvin Professor of Philosophy Emeritus and the inaugural director of the Chicago Center for Jewish Studies  remembering Brinker as a cultured  witty and intellectual colleague. “In exchanges  he could be wonderfully critical ” Stern said  but Brinker’s criticisms were well received because of his “extremely warm personality.”Besides teaching and building the Modern Hebrew Language and Literature program  Brinker helped bolster the University’s library  filling gaps in its collection in his fields of expertise  Stern said.Paul Mendes-Flohr  the Dorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Modern Jewish History and Thought  considered Brinker a beloved friend and mentor.“Not only was Menachem generous intellectually  he was also blessed with the gift of friendship  which he nurtured and sustained with unflagging care and concern ” he said.“As one of Israel’s most esteemed public intellectuals  his probing critiques of its cultural and political life attained a unique resonance precisely because they bore the stamp of a compelling existential concern for the ethical and spiritual direction the country had taken ” Mendes-Flohr said.Brinker was born in Jerusalem on Sept. 20  1935. Before commencing his university studies  Menachem was a shepherd in a left-wing kibbutz. In 1954  he completed his undergraduate degree in Hebrew literature and philosophy. He studied literature  linguistic theory and philosophy at Edinburgh and Oxford universities in 1966  and then earned his doctorate in philosophy at Tel Aviv University in 1974.Brinker fought as part of the Jerusalem Brigade during the Six-Day War and also fought in the Yom Kippur War. In 1968  he was appointed a lecturer in the Tel Aviv University philosophy department  and a year later he was appointed to the department of poetics and comparative literature  which he also helped found.In addition  Brinker was among the founders of the Israel Philosophical Association in 1967. Beginning in 1983  he taught philosophy and Hebrew literature at Hebrew University. At the same time  he served as a literary editor at the Keter publishing house. He was a member of the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities.Mendes-Flohr said his friendship with Brinker was sealed when they were both on the faculty of Hebrew University. Mendes-Flohr “consulted with him about a concept coined by Jean-Paul Sartre  whom he knew personally and about whom he had written extensively.”He said Brinker knew hundreds of poems by heart  not only in Hebrew but also English  French  German  Russian  Yiddish and even a few in Arabic. In his last weeks  Brinker composed a poem in alternating stanzas in Hebrew  English and French  and though he was too weak to write it down  he would recite it to his friends.“What I do recall is his joyful and mellifluous recitation of this  his last poem  which he took with him to his final resting place ” Mendes-Flohr said. “As one says in Hebrew  “zikhrono le’vracha: May his memory be a blessing to all who loved him and to the many whom he loved. “Brinker is survived by his partner  Janet Aviad  and his daughter  Hagit. His son  Gadi  died in 2010.Services have been held in Israel. At his request  no eulogies were given  but poems were recited by some of Israel’s eminent writers.
                    James W. Cronin  Nobel laureate and pioneering physicist  1931-2016            ,James W. Cronin  a pioneering scientist who shared theNobel Prize in physics in 1980for his groundbreaking work on the laws governing matter and antimatter and their role in the universe  died Aug. 25 in Saint Paul  Minn. He was 84.Cronin  SM’53  PhD’55  spent much of his career at the University of Chicago  first as a student and then a professor. A University Professor Emeritus of Physics and Astronomy & Astrophysics  he was remembered this week as a mentor  collaborator and visionary.“He inspired us all to reach further into the unknown with deep intuition  solid scientific backing and poetic vision ” said Angela Olinto  the Homer J. Livingston Distinguished Service Professor in Astronomy and Astrophysics. “He accepted his many recognitions and accolades with so much humility that he encouraged many generations to follow his vision.”Edward “Rocky” Kolb  dean of the Physical Sciences Division and the Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor in Astronomy and Astrophysics  described Cronin as “a person of real honesty and integrity who was a mentor and friend to so many people.”“Just like in basketball  there are good players in science  but the greatest players are the ones who make the people around them better. Jim was that great player ” Kolb said.Cronin’s research that resulted in the Nobel Prize came in 1964 while he was working with Val Fitch at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The two scientists  who were Princeton University professors at the time  observed the first example of nature’s preference for matter over antimatter. Without the phenomenon  which physicists refer to as charge-parity violation  no matter would exist in the universe.
                    Paul W. Friedrich  anthropologist and linguist  1927-2016            ,Editor's note:A memorial service for Paul W. Friedrich will be held Oct. 28 at 4 p.m. in Bond ChapelPaul W. Friedrich  an anthropologist  linguist and poet whose sweeping scholarship ranged from agrarian reform in Mexico to Russian lyric poetry to ties between Thoreau’sWaldenand Hindu scripture  died at his home on Aug. 11. He was 88 years old.Friedrich taught for five decades as a professor at the University of Chicago  while reaching across disciplines  cultures and languages in his research and writings. He described his work in an interview published inAnnual Review of Anthropologyas a triangle in which the corners were cultural theory  language and poetics—on both abstract and concrete levels. He discussed how he immersed himself in a subject to elucidate in his work the “hundreds if not thousands of little connections  many of them lying very deep.”“By the time you get to writing  you’ve already thought about two dozen fields that are connected with what you’re doing ” he said in the 2013 interview.Friedrich was a sought-after teacher at the University  known for his intensity and openness to new ideas. In recognition  a group of students published a collection of essays:Culture  Language and the Individual: A Tribute to Paul Friedrich.“He was known and revered as a dedicated and passionate teacher  always encouraging students to write about what they felt strongly was an important and significant issue ” said Robert B. Pippin  the Evelyn Stefansson Nef Distinguished Service Professor and chair of the Committee on Social Thought  where Friedrich held an appointment in addition to the Anthropology and Linguistics departments.Academic rootsFriedrich was born into an academic family; his father was Carl Joachim Friedrich  an internationally known political theorist and professor at Harvard University. After a year and a half at Williams College  the younger Friedrich served in the U.S. Army and returned from service to complete both bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Harvard. While a graduate student  Friedrich was hired by the newly established Russian Research Center at Harvard to interview captured and dissident Soviets in post-war Berlin about their lives.For his dissertation research in 1955-56  Friedrich traveled to Michoacan  Mexico with his first wife Lore Bucher Friedrich and their two young daughters  Maria and Susan  living closely with the Tarascan. The results becameAgrarian Revolt in a Mexican Village  a classic in Latin American Studies  andThe Princes of Naranja: An Essay in Anthrohistorical Method. Both works focused on oppositional indigenous politics and their organization by social forces.Friedrich received his PhD from Yale in 1957 and did fieldwork and taught in India before joining the University of Pennsylvania in 1959. He moved in 1962 to the University of Chicago  where his scholarly work eventually included Slavic languages  Classics  comparative literature and books ranging fromMusic in Russian PoetrytoThe Gita within Walden. He taught dozens of courses including cultural anthropology  Russian literature  and Homeric Greek with James Redfield  the Edward Olson Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus.“When we taught together ” Redfield said  “the rule was that he taught the Greek and I taught the linguistics. That way we were always teaching each other.”With his second wife  the material culture specialist Margaret Hardin  Friedrich returned to Michoacan in the mid-1960s to further study the Tarascan language. Friedrich’s later books covered subjects fromProto-Indo-European TreestoThe Meaning of Aphrodite  to which his third wife Deborah Gordon Friedrich made significant contributions. In his last years  he collaborated with his fourth wife  Domnica Radulescu.Parallel to—and intertwined with—his academic and scholarly publications  Friedrich produced seven volumes of poetry. He was known in the “ethno-poetics” movement and brought together in his teachings poetry from more than 20 different literary traditions.“Every time you ran into him he wanted to talk about ideas. It was an energy and excitement he conveyed and this sense of freshness that wasn’t naïve or staged ” said Catherine O’Neil  PhD‘96  a former student of Friedrich who is now associate professor of Russian at the U.S. Naval Academy.Friedrich held a passion for language  rhythms and sound. Music was a concept that pervaded his work not only in the way sound meets words in poetry  but the rhythms and frictions in social context and relations between people  said Mary Scoggin  PhD‘97  a former student of Friedrich who is now professor of anthropology at Humboldt State University.“Paul had a visceral approach to natural objects like the trees and birds that suffuse not only his work but his everyday language  as he observed and savored our surroundings ” Scoggin said. “He approached a thing not merely as a symbol to be interpreted  but a tangible presence that smells  pokes and yields to the touch.”Friedrich received the University’s Faculty Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring in 1999  and the Yale Graduate School Alumni Association awarded him the Wilbur Cross Medal in 2007.Friedrich is survived by four ex-wives; his children Maria  Su  Roland Peter  Kat and Joan Lenore Friedrich  and Nicholas Radulescu; his step-son Alexander Radulescu Tanson; his three grandchildren Nora and Isabelle Friedrich McTwigan and Asa Geismar Friedrich; and his sister Matilda Cornwall Friedrich.The departments in which Friedrich held appointments are planning a memorial on campus in the fall.

                    Gary Toback  renowned authority on kidney disease  1941-2016            ,Gary Toback  professor of medicine and former interim section chief of nephrology  died July 20 when he was struck by a vehicle while jogging near his South Shore home.Toback  a highly respected authority on kidney disease  especially the use of renal growth factors to treat acute kidney injury  was a loyal  productive and popular member of the faculty for 42 years. He was devoted to the care of patients with kidney disease and the education of medical students.He was also a highly respected clinical scientist. His earliest studies focused on potassium and the kidney  and on the development of kidney stones. Later in his career he concentrated on proteins associated with regeneration of kidney tissues. More recently  in collaboration with colleagues in gastroenterology  he searched for proteins that could prevent damage or speed recovery for gastric epithelial tissues  with a particular emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease.“I feel a great sense of personal loss at this tragic event ” said Kenneth Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division and the Pritzker School of Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Chicago. “Gary was a true role model for physician-scientists  deeply committed to scholarship  education and the care of patients with renal disease. He always conducted himself with the highest level of dignity and professionalism.”Toback’s efforts to identify  purify and characterize various growth factors involved in wound healing  and later with kidney stone disease  led to multiple patents and the formation in 1995 of a biotechnology company NephRx Corporation  based in Kalamazoo  Mich.“He trained as a scientist and a clinician ” said Fredric Coe  professor of medicine and medical director of the University’s Kidney Stone Prevention Program  “and focused on cell biology  in this case how individual cells respond to an injury. In the process  he discovered a molecule  antrum mucosal protein-18  which is of considerable importance for cell repair.”He was also “passionate about both scientific enquiry and the rights and protection of patients participating in clinical research ” said Arlene Chapman  section chief of nephrology and director of the Clinical Research Center for the University of Chicago’s Institute for Translational Medicine. As the research subject advocate for the ITM  Toback “tirelessly ensured participants’ best interests were taken into account when enrolled in clinical trials ” she said.“Gary Toback was a quadruple threat ” said Jonathan Moss  professor of anesthesiology. “He was a superb clinician  an outstanding researcher  a gifted teacher and a successful administrator.”Colleagues also remember Toback as a remarkably friendly  kind  level-headed and well-liked professor  readily available to faculty and students  and consistently able to provide solid  sensible advice.“Gary was a mensch ” said geneticist Graeme Bell  the Kovler Family Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine. Everyone liked him. Talking with him was valuable because he was widely respected in his field  always saw the big picture and could fill in the details  as needed  with pure common sense.”“He was a superb listener ” said Marshall Lindheimer  professor emeritus of medicine and obstetrics and gynecology  who helped recruit Toback to UChicago. “He was open and engaging. He had a talent for paying attention. He could focus intently on whoever was speaking as if they were saying something profound—even if it was mostly malarkey.”“Gary was a quiet soul ” Coe added  “a lovely  warm  gracious  considerate man. He was always a good person to have in the room.”Four decades at UChicagoFrederick Gary Toback was born Oct. 23  1941  in Brooklyn  N.Y. He graduatedcum laudein biochemistry from Columbia University in 1963. He completed his medical training at the New York University School of Medicine in 1967  followed by residency at the Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital  part of the Case Western Reserve system. After serving for a year in the United States Navy Medical Corps  he returned to school to earn his PhD in biochemistry at Boston University  followed by a clinical nephrology fellowship at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.He came to the University of Chicago in 1974 as an assistant professor of medicine and—except for one sabbatical year at the Salk Institute in San Diego  where he studied the importance of sodium ions in epithelial cell growth—stayed for the rest of his career. He was promoted to associate professor in 1980 and professor in 1985. He served as interim section chief for nephrology from late 2008 to 2015. He published 100 research papers during his 42 years at the University of Chicago and lectured at distinguished universities throughout the United States and Europe.Toback took on dozens of administrative and committee roles  within the University and on the national level. He participated in four internal search committees for department chairmen and three department reviews and was a member or chair of multiple grant review committees at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Toback was honored nationally by election to the Association of American Physicians and the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He was a fellow of the American Heart Association’s Council on the Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease. He was an active member of the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology.The University’s Biological Sciences Division honored him last year with a symposium about the biology of kidney disease and its treatment.He was also devoted to his family. He married his childhood friend Phyllis Brooks in 1963. They raised three children—David Andrew Toback  Alison Rachel and Jonathan Daniel—and have seven grandchildren.A memorial service at the University of Chicago will be held at a later date.

                    William H. McNeill  world historian and distinguished scholar  1917-2016            ,Prof. William H. McNeill  a pioneer in the field of world history and author of the seminal workThe Rise of the West  died July 8. He was 98.McNeill  AB’38  AM’39  was a teacher and scholar for four decades at the University of Chicago. The Robert A. Millikan Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in History  he was the author of more than 20 books  from the sweeping history of human diseasePlagues and Peoplesto a memoir of the University during the presidency of Robert Hutchins.McNeill was awarded theErasmus Prize in 1996andNational Humanities Medal by President Obama in 2010.TheRise of the West  which traces civilizations through 5 000 years of recorded history  received the National Book Award for history and biography in 1964.In a 1987 interview at the time of his retirement  McNeill said it was important for historians not to be too narrow in their outlook. “History has to look at the whole world ” he said. “And that means you have to know how the rest of the world is  how it got to be the way it is.”McNeill was critical in launching the field of world history at a time when the discipline was narrowly focused on the history of Europe and its past and present colonies. In his work  he emphasized the connections and exchanges between civilizations rather than placing them in a vacuum.“Bill McNeill was a scholar of extraordinary boldness  range and high creativity ” said John W. Boyer  the Martin A. Ryerson Professor in History and dean of the College. “He was able to see patterns and relationships among highly complex and disparate historical phenomena on a global level in ways that enabled him to write magnificent and courageous books of large intellectual compass.”Boyer said McNeill provided decisive leadership during his chairmanship of the Department of History in the 1960s  rebuilding it into a preeminent site for international historical research after the department had lost much of its luster in the 1940s and ‘50s.An early interest in historyMcNeill was born in Vancouver  British Columbia. His father  John McNeill  was a historian of Christianity whose efforts to tell the story of faith through the connections among denominations inspired his son.McNeill arrived at the University of Chicago as a 10-year-old when his father was appointed to the University faculty. He graduated from the Laboratory Schools and received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from UChicago before attending Cornell to pursue a PhD in history.McNeill’s studies were interrupted by his service in World War II  which included an assignment as assistant military attaché in Cairo. The position led to his working with Greek and Yugoslav governments in exile  making him an eyewitness to the middle stages of the Greek civil war. He wrote his first book from that experience The Greek Dilemma: War and Aftermath  published in 1947.In Cairo he met his future wife  Elizabeth Darbishire  who worked for the Office of War Information. She became his proofreader  critic and collaborator. They had four children together.After the war  he completed his PhD at Cornell  and in 1947  he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago.While in graduate school  McNeill stumbled across Arnold Toynbee’sThe Study of History  which was an attempt to chart the rise and fall of world civilizations. Although he later worked under Toynbee at Chatham House in London  McNeill broke with Toynbee in his own work  seeing an interconnectedness among societies that didn’t exist in Toynbee’s writings.A love of teaching and UChicagoAt the University of Chicago  McNeill devoted himself to teaching in addition to his research. “Teaching is the most wonderful way to learn things ” he said in an interview. “You have to get up before a class at 10 o’clock the next morning and have something to say.” In 1983  he received the University’s Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.McNeill helped design the History of Western Civilization Core sequence at the University in the late 1940s and played a major role in introducing the history of other world civilizations as key elements of the College’s curriculum in the 1950s and ‘60s.  He had a deep love and respect for the University and its intellectual community  dedicatingThe Rise of the Westto “the community of scholars constituting the University of Chicago.”“My father loved the University of Chicago wholeheartedly  its traditions and its people. A good-natured argument was his favorite form of entertainment  and he felt his colleagues and students at the University provided that in full measure ” said his son John McNeill  a professor of history at Georgetown University.After his retirement  McNeill and his wife moved to Connecticut  where he continued to write. He completed a biography of Toynbee in 1989 and wroteTheHuman Web: A Bird’s-Eye View of World Historywith John McNeill  published in 2003. In 2005  he publishedThe Pursuit of Truth: A Historian’s Memoir.In an essay for the American Historical Association  McNeill explained the importance of studying history. “Ignorance of history—that is  absent or defective collective memory—does deprive us of the best available guide for public action  especially in encounters with outsiders  whether the outsiders are another nation  another civilization or some special group within national borders.”McNeill is survived by his four children and 11 grandchildren.
                    Abner Mikva  public servant and Law School faculty member  1926-2016            ,Abner Mikva  one of the few Americans to serve in senior positions in all three branches of the federal government  passed away on July 4. He was 90.Mikva  JD’51  taught at theUniversity of Chicago Law Schooland served as senior director of itsMandel Legal Aid Clinicafter retiring from government service.His roles in the federal government stretched from serving in Congress in the 1970s  to sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals in the 1980s  to being appointed White House counsel by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Then  while teaching at UChicago  Mikva befriended and mentored ayoung Law School lecturer named Barack Obama.“Abner Mikva was the Law School graduate who clearly embodied public service ” said Law School Dean Thomas J. Miles  the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Law and Economics. “Through his work in government and his teaching at the Law School  he encouraged younger people to join him in his important and honorable work. It is no surprise that he mentored a future president.”A native of Wisconsin  Mikva graduated from Washington University at St. Louis and served with the Army Air Corps in World War II. He graduated from the Law School in 1951 and clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sherman Minton.It was while at the Law School that Mikva got an early taste of politics. On his way home one night  he stopped by the local ward office and said he’d like to volunteer for the Democratic campaigns for the upcoming election. The committeeman asked who sent him  to which Mikva replied “nobody.” The committeeman then told the young law student: “We don’t want nobody nobody sent.”Mikva wasn’t deterred  however. In 1956  he won election to the Illinois House as a Democrat and in 1968 was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives  where he served eight years from two different congressional districts.In 1979  President Jimmy Carter nominated Mikva to the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit. He served on the court for 16 years  including the last three as chief judge.Mikva left the bench in 1994 at the request of President Bill Clinton  who appointed him White House counsel. He served two years in the senior role before moving back to Chicago to start the first of his many retirements.It was then that Mikva began to teach at UChicago. He also was appointed senior director of its Mandel Legal Aid Clinic and led the clinic’s Appellate Advocacy Project.“It was such a memorable experience having Judge Mikva for Legislative Process ” said Adam Bonin  JD’97  one of Mikva’s first students in the course and now an election law attorney in Philadelphia. “There’s no substitute for the real-world experience he had. The stories he told were amazing  and he was always so generous with his time.”Mikva and his wife  Zoe  started the nonprofitMikva Challenge  a civic leadership program for young people which encourages them to get involved in political issues and campaigns. In 2014  in honor of Mikva’s long career in public service  the Kanter Family Foundation established the Mikva Fellowship Program Fund at the Law School to support a one-year postgraduate public interest law fellowship.“He was smart as a whip  generous of spirit  and dedicated to the public good ” said Geoffrey Stone  the Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law. “Our nation needs more leaders like him.”The University in the spring of 2014 awarded Mikva theBenton Medal for Distinguished Public Service  which recognizes distinguished public service in the field of education. Later that year  Obama bestowed upon his mentor thePresidential Medal of Freedom  the nation’s highest civilian honor. Mikva called it the “greatest thing that ever happened to me.”In addition to his wife Zoe  Mikva is survived by three daughters  Mary and Laurie Mikva  and Rachel Mikva Rosenberg; and seven grandchildren.The burial will be a private family funeral. A public memorial will be planned for early August.
                    Alison Winter  historian of science  1965-2016            ,Editor’s note:A memorial service for Alison Winter will be held Nov. 2 at 4 p.m. in Rockefeller Memorial ChapelAlison Winter  a historian of science and medicine whose book on memory won the University of Chicago Press’s top honor  died Wednesday of a brain tumor. She was 50 years old.Winter  AB’87  was a professor of history whose research often focused in areas of science and medicine that were unorthodox and less traveled. She explored how 19th-century mesmerism catalyzed efforts to define and demarcate science inMesmerized: Powers of Mind in Victorian Britainand the cultural and scientific history of human understanding of memory inMemory: Fragments of a Modern History  which won the UChicago Press’s Gordon J. Laing Prize in 2014.She was dedicated to supporting the next generation of scholars.Prof. Robert RichardsWinter taught undergraduates in the history of medicine  film and gender studies  guided doctoral students in their dissertations  and mentored postdoctoral fellows at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Students described her as a generous critic and strong advocate. Even after becoming ill  Winter continued to co-teach an undergraduate seminar in history of science via video chat – first from home and later from the hospital.“She was dedicated to supporting the next generation of scholars ” said Robert Richards  the Morris Fishbein Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Science and Medicine. “She loved finding a wedge in an intellectual exchange and pushing it. But you could never get mad at her. She always had a sly smile.”Winter first arrived at UChicago in 1983 as an undergraduate. Richards said Winter’s father  who taught mathematics at the University of Michigan  wanted her to major in science. She was interested in English literature. The compromise was the history of science  which quickly became Winter’s passion.Winter received a master’s degree and doctorate from the University of Cambridge. It was there she met her husband Adrian Johns  who is the Allan Grant Maclear Professor of History at UChicago.Winter’s dissertation on mesmerism became her first bookMesmerized which the UChicago Press published in 1998. Alex Owen writing in the journalVictorian Studiesdescribed it as a tour de force that requires “a reevaluation of precisely what constituted ‘center’ and ‘margin’ during a period in which many Victorian intellectuals and public figures experimented with mesmerism.”After Cambridge  Winter taught at the California Institute of Technology before returning to UChicago in 2001.Winter was awarded fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim  Andrew W. Mellon and National Science foundations  contributing to the research forMemory. In the book  she explores how scientists grope for metaphors to explain such an elusive subject  and how those metaphors evolved to reflect changing technology—from memory as a filing cabinet to a reel of film available for playback.Doctoral students of Winter said she had a unique ability to balance criticism and encouragement  asking key questions to guide research rather than direct it. Caitjan Gainty  AM’05  PhD’12  remembers pulling up rugs with Winter at her home in Hyde Park  discussing future intellectual projects and talking about Winter’s fascination with a light-therapy enthusiast who once owned the property.“She had confidence in me as a scholar before I even understood what it meant to do that kind of work ” said Gainty  lecturer in the history of science  technology and medicine at King’s College London.Winter is survived by Johns and their four children  David  Lizzie  Zoe  and Benjamin; her mother  Judy Swartz  and stepfathers David Ballou and Fred Swartz; her father  David Winter  and stepmother  Michele Weipert-Winter; and her brother  Jonathan Ballou.A memorial service for Winter is planned for Autumn Quarter.

If I needed someone to welcome a new student  Ilan was my go-to person.”Naibryf made an impression from the moment he arrived on campus  where he lived in Boyer House as a first-year. His roommate then was Jon Zaghloul  who remembered Naibryf as a warm and welcoming presence who helped him acclimate to undergraduate life.Zaghloul  now a rising fourth-year student  also recalled how Naibryf would laugh and joke around  injecting fun even into household activities like cooking  organizing a pantry or folding laundry.“He had a good heart ” Zaghloul said. “He could always tell when something was wrong  and he was always trying to find ways to make you happy and put a smile on your face.”Kyle Ruark  who also lived in Boyer House  said Naibryf brought a contagious positive energy to everything he did  be it taking photos while traveling  playing guitar  skateboarding or just hanging out with friends on campus.Once  Ruark and Naibryf had a group dinner in Chicago before heading to Millennium Park.“Ilan brought his new camera to take some photos ” said Ruark  now a rising fourth-year student. “We ended up skating for a while that night and Ilan took many great pictures. It was such a simple night  yet one of the most enjoyable nights of my time here at the University.”

                    Robert Replogle  cardiac surgeon  1931-2016            ,Robert L. Replogle  a nationally recognized specialist in congenital and open-heart surgery  died at the University of Chicago Medicine on May 9  surrounded by his family. He was 84 years old.Replogle spent most of his career in Chicago  beginning in 1967 at UChicago  followed by leadership positions at Michael Reese  Ingalls and Columbus hospitals. The long-time Hyde Park resident retired in 1998.His impact  however  was international. Replogle lectured all over the world. He was one of the first members of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons  an organization in which he held multiple leadership roles  including president from 1996 to 1997.He was also a key player in developingCTSNet.org  a national database managed by STS that includes detailed records of millions of cases  which can be used to track variations in surgical mortality and to negotiate reimbursement from government and private payers.“Bob Replogle was at the core of visionary changes that have had a lasting impact on cardiothoracic surgery worldwide ” said thoracic surgeon Mark Ferguson  professor of surgery at the University of Chicago  who trained with Replogle. “He had the personality  foresight and intelligence to make lasting connections among various disciplines.” In addition to the creation of the STS National Database  his contributions include the establishment of the Thoracic Surgery Foundation and the STS political action committee.“For me ” said Keith Horvath director of cardiothoracic surgery research at the National Heart  Lung and Blood Institute  Replogle was “my surgical father. I could not have asked for a better mentor. I remember him every time I dispense advice  which always began with the preface  ‘So  here’s the deal…’”Replogle embraced new technology. One of his first scholarly papers described the “Replogle tube ” a two-channel suction device inserted into the throat of a newborn with a malformed esophagus to prevent aspiration pneumonia. It is still in use.‘A Force of Nature’Robert Lee Replogle was born Sept. 30  1931  in Ottumwa  a farming community in rural Iowa. He entered Cornell College in 1949  where he studied biology  played football and practiced with the nationally ranked wrestling squad.The Korean War interrupted his education. In 1951  Replogle enrolled in the United States Navy and worked at the Naval Research Institute in Bethesda  Md.  where he met surgeon Ralph Alley  who nurtured his interest in medical sciences. After the war  Replogle returned to Cornell College  but because he was accepted by Harvard Medical School for the fall of 1956  he never finished his undergraduate degree. The institution later granted him an honorary doctorate in 1972.Robert Gross  an inspirational cardiothoracic pediatric surgeon  mentored Replogle in medical school. That same year  he met a college undergraduate named Carol Heeschen. Before their first date  he told friends he was concerned she might be a little immature  but after their second date  she told her roommate: “That’s the man I’m going to marry.”The pair fulfilled that vision in 1958 and continued their education. She earned her PhD in English literature. He graduatedcum laudefrom medical school in 1960  did an internship at the University of Minnesota Hospital  and began his residency in the Harvard hospital system  specializing in pediatric surgery at what is now known as Boston Children’s Hospital.After completing his residency in and spending a year on staff at Boston Children’s  Replogle moved to UChicago to direct the congenital heart surgery program in 1967. He rose quickly through the ranks  becoming section chief of pediatric surgery in 1970 and chief of cardiac surgery in 1973.Replogle later completed additional training in adult cardiac surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. When he returned  he concentrated on adult and pediatric open-heart operations. In 1978  his team garnered national attention when they performed a triple cardiac bypass for entertainer Jackie Gleason  who was on tour in Chicago.Replogle also took on the role of chief of cardiac surgery at nearby affiliate Michael Reese Hospital from 1977 to 1989. In the late 1980s  he also headed cardiac surgery programs at Ingalls Memorial Hospital and Columbus Cabrini Hospital  also on Chicago's South Side. He retired in 1998 after having built strong surgical teams  mentored many outstanding academic surgeons and published more than 100 scientific papers and book chapters.“For those who knew him  Bob was a force of nature ” Ferguson said. “He changed the nature of our specialty.”Outside the office  Replogle found ways to investigate “fast cars  scuba diving  underwater photography and collecting wine ” Ferguson added. But the project that seemed to mean the most to him wasOpportunity Village. Located in Clear Lake  Iowa  Opportunity Village is home for adults with disabilities  including Replogle’s brother Ralph  who suffered from cerebral palsy. Founded in the 1960s  it now cares for more than 600 residents.Replogle is survived by his wife Carol  of Chicago; three children: Jennifer (Mark) Bremer of Boston  Edith (Scott) Sheffer of Palo Alto  Calif.; and son Robert E. (Michelle) Replogle of Grand Junction  Colo.; plus nine grandchildren. In lieu of flowers  donations should be directed to Opportunity Village or to Cornell College in memory of Robert L. Replogle.
                    Renata Gross Horowitz  fourth-year in the College  1994-2016            ,Renata Gross Horowitz  a fourth-year in the College  is being remembered by family and friends as a deeply engaged student and leader who was also a talented artist immersed in filmmaking and photography.She concentrated in interdisciplinary studies in the humanities and was working on a BA involving the classification and destigmatization of PTSD and mental illness. Horowitz died April 8 from injuries suffered in an automobile accident while traveling to the Badlands of South Dakota. She was 21.“Renata was a brilliant artist in many media—visually inspired  formally rigorous  narratively rich and attuned to sound ” said Lauren Berlant  the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor in English.“She was also such a thoughtful reader of theory and history: committed to her views  and at the same time  open to new ways of thinking about generating better worlds  discourses and institutions ” Berlant added. “She read across disciplines and genres voraciously and with an attitude of generous criticism. Working with her was a genuine pleasure.”Horowitz worked at the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts  where she helped support the creation of a documentary on UChicago’s music collective Contempo and coordinated the performance of a Chinese opera troupe as part of the Envisioning China Festival.“We were very fortunate that one of the places that Renata chose to lend her considerable talents was the Logan Center for the Arts ” said Bill Michel  executive director of the Logan Center. “As an artist and student intern  Renata’s exceptional ability to accomplish almost any task with warmth and creativity contributed greatly to the artistic community at the Logan Center and throughout the University.”Fourth-year Camila Palomino  who lived with Horowitz for four years  called her “an alien—an otherworldly being who shared her passions with everyone she came by. She was a muse  an artist  a lover  an explorer and creator of worlds.”Fourth-year Allison Torem added: “Not only was she understanding  so supportive and had a great sense of humor  but she is the kind of person who I think bad male screenwriters base their ‘manic pixie dream girl’ characters on. She was so sincere and energetic and wanted so thoroughly to live life with the firmest embrace of human connection  spiritual and physical adventure.”Her family remembers Horowitz’s compassion and empathy for her diverse circle of friends. “She loved the friends and academic mentors that she met at the University ” said her father  Harold Horowitz. “We will miss her raucous laugh  robust debates and vivid presence ” he added. The family recalls “her enormous zest for life ” and that she loved travel  dance and reading.Renata Horowitz also was deeply committed to activism. Having studied at the Alvin Ailey School in New York City  she became determined to provide more opportunities for young black dancers. She collaborated with a newly formed non-profit organization called Memoirs of Blacks in Ballet  spearheading fundraising and communications efforts  including making a film for the group’s website. Her family also cited her 2015 summer internship at Lawyers for Children in New York City  which inspired her engagement in issues at the intersection of the legal  mental health and child protection systems  with the goal of improving services and changing public policy. At the time of her death  she was finalizing a documentary about the experiences of UChicago students who had been admitted to Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital.She is survived by her father  Harold Horowitz; her mother  Amie Gross; her stepmother  Susan Epstein; her siblings  Azra Horowitz and Alison Epstein; her stepsister  Lauren Binet  and her step-grandfather Harold Epstein.Services were held April 12 in New York City. The College is planning a memorial service. Contributions in her memory may be made to LifeSource Organ and Tissue Donations  Memoirs of Blacks in Ballet or Lawyers for Children.
                    John Light  pioneer in theoretical chemical dynamics  1934-2016            ,Prof. Emeritus John Light  one of the first scientists to describe the dynamics of chemical reactions on a molecular scale and longtime editor of theJournal of Chemical Physics  died Jan. 18  in a Denver hospital following a severe illness. He was 81.“John was a wonderful friend and colleague ” said Donald Levy  UChicago’s vice president for research and for national laboratories and the Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry. “Getting to work with him  both at theJournal of Chemical Physicsand as a scientific colleague  was a major factor in making a career in our department so enjoyable and productive. The physical chemistry group was outstanding by any measure  and John was one of the leaders in making it so.”Gregory Voth  the Haig P. Papazian Distinguished Service Professor in Chemistry  praised Light as “a wonderful man and a great theorist. His long editorship of theJournal of Chemical Physics in many ways  oversaw a golden era in the field of chemical physics ” said Voth.James Norris Jr. also had fond memories of Light  whom he called “a true champion of the department and the University.” Norris  the Robert A. Millikan Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in Chemistry  recalled visiting often during Light’s tenure as editor of theJournal of Chemical Physics. “He was always willing to take time from his busy editorial duties when I sought advice on scientific or departmental topics ” Norris said.Light rose to prominence in theoretical chemical dynamics in the 1960s. Before then  scientists relied on macroscopic-scale experiments  such as pouring one type of fluid into another  to study how chemicals would react with each other. But then physical chemists began colliding molecular beams of reactants under vacuum conditions and examining the angles at which product molecules were found  in order to measure the probability that a chemical reaction takes place.These molecular beam experiments inspired Light to understand chemical dynamics at a molecular scale. “Young people are always looking for something new to do  and this was something new ” said William H. Miller  the Kenneth S. Pitzer Distinguished Professor Emeritus in Chemistry at the University of California  Berkeley. “Inspired by these molecular beam experiments  John was one of the real pioneers in developing the theory of chemical dynamics starting in the 1960s ” Miller said.Light had reached the pinnacle of the field in the late 1960s  just when Miller was starting out. Miller told himself that “if I could follow his pathway  that would really be an accomplishment. He was one of my early heroes.”Light’s development of theoretical and computational methods for determining reaction rates and related information are important for modeling combustion and atmospheric chemistry  noted George C. Schatz  the Morrison Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University and editor-in-chief of theJournal of Physical Chemistry.“John was expert at developing numerical tools and algorithms ” Schatz said. “Many methods that came out of his research work are still in common use decades later.”Schatz also credited Light with teaching him much about how to be a journal editor.“He had a sense of professionalism that I very much admired ” Schatz said. “This did much to secure the reputation of the journal  making it the top journal for the fields that it represented while he was editor. Thanks to John  the University of Chicago was the top institution in the field of chemical physics during his period as editor.”John C. Light was born Nov. 24  1934  in Mount Vernon  N.Y. He received his bachelor’s degree with honors from Oberlin College in 1956  and his PhD from Harvard University in 1960. From 1959 to 1961 he was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. Light became an instructor in UChicago’s Department of Chemistry and the James Franck Institute in 1961. By 1970 he had earned the rank of professor.Light also held appointments as a visiting professor at Yale University in 1968; as a research associate at Argonne National Laboratory from 1975 to 1980; and as a visiting scientist at JILA  a joint institute of the University of Colorado  Boulder  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  in 1976-77. He consulted for the Institute for Defense Analyses  IBM Research Laboratories and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.Administratively  Light served as director of UChicago’s Materials Research Laboratory from 1970 to 1973  and as chair of the chemistry department from 1980 to 1982. As a research mentor  he oversaw the work of 31 graduate students and 25 postdoctoral fellows. Many of them are actively conducting research at universities worldwide. Light praised their contributions ina special issueof theJournal of Physical Chemistry Athat was published in his honor in 2006.“I learned much more from them than they did from me ” wrote Light  who retired as professor emeritus in 2001. “It has been a great pleasure to have worked with so many gifted people.”Although Light retired as professor emeritus in 2001  he continued to attend the occasional scientific meeting. “He was very good at digging into the essentials of research topics  so we valued his presence ” said Schatz. “He will be greatly missed.”In 2004  Light and his wife retired to Colorado’s Arkansas River Valley  to the town of Nathrop  Colo. There he enjoyed the community  skiing  hiking  horseback riding and their dog  Libby.Light was a fellow of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also was an elected member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science; a member of Sigma Xi  the international honor society of science and engineering; and of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor societyLight is survived by his wife  Phyllis Kittel  whom he married in UChicago’s Bond Chapel; a brother  Richard Light of New York; three sons by his first wife  the late Nancy Seaburg Light: David (and Rose) Light of Chicago; Robert (and Alison) Light of Boston; and Erik (and Jenny) Light of Washington  D.C.; 10 grandchildren: Isabella  Ethan  Bryce  Michael and Clara Light of Chicago; Alex  Hazel and Ian Light of Boston; and Christine and Jennifer Light of Washington  D.C.The family will hold memorial services near the home in Colorado and at the Light family estate in Austerlitz  N.Y. Arrangements for a memorial service and symposium on the University campus are pending.
                    John Fennessy  pioneering radiologist  1933-2016            ,John Fennessy  a pioneer in the field of chest radiology  died Jan. 3 from complications following cardiac surgery in November 2015. He was 82.A professor emeritus and former chair of the Department of Radiology  Fennessy was known by colleagues as the final authority on anything involving radiologic examination of the chest or abdomen  and the person other physicians turned to for interpretation of subtle diagnostic details on X-rays.[view:story=block_3=185457]Those who trained with Fennessy also recalled his patience  kindness  distinctive sense of humor and genuine respect for medical students and residents. He won the McClintock Award for Outstanding Teaching in 1969 and was selected nearly 30 times as a favorite faculty member by the graduating medical students.“He was one of the most thoughtful people I’ve ever met ” said pulmonologist J.P. Kress  professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. “He was generous with his time  down to earth  funny in a kind way and an unbelievably great radiologist. On a tough case  we all wanted his input.”Whenever his former students get together  “we all agree that we hope  someday  to be just like him ” Kress said. “None of us has quite gotten there yet.”Fennessy had a direct impact on the field. One of his first papers  published in 1966  expanded on a technique developed in Japan in which radiologists inserted a catheter into the lung to obtain tissue from lesions at the periphery of the bronchial tree. Fennessy’s innovative adaptation  known as the bronchial brush  enabled physicians to acquire better samples from hard-to-reach areas of the lungs  without the need for an incision. His technique was widely disseminated in the United States and abroad.He also was a founding member of the Society of Thoracic Radiology and a member of the prestigious Fleischner Society  an international  multidisciplinary medical society for thoracic radiology.“He was sort of a legend ” said Steve Montner  associate professor of radiology at UChicago  who trained under Fennessy. “We were all a little awed by him. He was one of the gods of chest radiography  but he was so kind and gentle  he quickly put patients and trainees at ease.”John James Fennessy was born March 8  1933  in Clonmel  Ireland. He was educated at the Glenstal Abbey School and University College  Dublin  where he completed his medical degree in 1958. He began his internship at Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin  before moving to the United States in 1959 to work as an intern at Mercy Hospital in Chicago.He came to UChicago as a resident in 1960 and was elected chief resident in his final year  followed by two years on staff as an instructor. In 1965  he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and professor in 1974.That year he was named chairman of radiology  a position he held for 10 years. In 1982  Fennessy led the team that designed the department’s clinical facility in Mitchell Hospital  which opened in 1983.“He was an extremely capable but somewhat reluctant chairman ” recalled Heber MacMahon  who worked with Fennessy for his residency and is now chief of thoracic radiology at UChicago. “He preferred teaching and taking care of patients to administration and battling for resources  but he helped build up the department with a series of excellent recruits and was able to bring in the latest technology for the opening of Mitchell Hospital in 1983.Fennessy won many honors for his research  teaching and service to the field. He was elected first vice president of the Radiological Society of North America in 1987. He was invited to speak as a visiting professor at universities across the United States as well as in Canada  England  Ireland  Qatar and Taiwan.He was also the radiologist for a team assembled by UChicago gastroenterologist Joseph Kirsner  which provided medical care for King Hassan II of Morocco for two decades at the University of Chicago and at the royal palace in Rabat  Morocco’s capital.Family and colleagues cited Fennessy’s many interests outside medicine.“He was a voracious reader—a habit we all inherited ” said daughter Deirdre Wallace Fennessy. “He lived and breathed medicine  but he also knew and taught us a great deal about the history and literature of Ireland. He stayed in touch with relatives and friends there and often took us to visit. He even kept a small house there  a shack really  with no running water. He particularly enjoyed fly fishing. I think he was happiest out in the woods.”Fennessy is survived by his wife of 55 years  Ann Mary Ursula; two siblings in Ireland  Nora Stapleton and Cianan Fennessy; and six children: Deirdre Ann  Conor Dermott  Sean Donal  Rona Meabdh  Niall Patrick and Ruairi Brendan. One daughter  Emer Moira  died last year. Dr. Fennessy and his wife have five grandchildren and numerous nephews and nieces.Funeral services were held on Jan. 11 at St. Thomas the Apostle Church  5472 S. Kimbark Ave. The family plans to inter his ashes in Ireland.
                    Kathryn Gould  venture capitalist and University trustee  1950-2015            ,As a successful venture capitalist  Kathryn Gould  MBA’78  knew the value of hard work and creativity as well as the thrill of nurturing a good idea into a successful business. Perhaps it was not much of a surprise  then  that the high-tech startup expert happily spent her retirement developing a boutique winery in the Sierra Mountain foothills.“I often walk among my grapevines and think how grateful I am for my life right now ” she said in the 2014 University of Chicago Booth School of Businessconvocation address. “But if the vines had come first  without the adventure and hard work  it wouldn’t be nearly as sweet.”Gould  65  a University of Chicago trustee  died Nov. 26  2015  of cancer. A trustee since 2002  she served as chair of the Investment Committee from 2006 to 2010.Gould earned a 90 percent internal rate of return over the course of her investing career  making her one of the most accomplished venture capitalists in the field. She was featured onForbes magazine’s“Midas List” of best venture investors in technology and in 2005 received the Chicago Booth Distinguished Entrepreneurial Alumni Award. Her extensive service to the University included membership on the Council for Chicago Booth  which she joined in 1998.“Kathryn lived a life of purpose and consequence ” said Mary Lou Gorno  MBA’76  vice chair of the University Board of Trustees. “She was a tough and demanding editor of life dreams. Kathryn found the highest expression of her talent in business and the highest expression of her love in family and friends.”Gould made her mark in a field previously dominated by men  refusing to let that history limit her.Steve Blank  a successful high-tech entrepreneur  described Gould in a2014 blog postas “twice as smart and just as tough as the guys ” and said that she was a role model for all venture capitalists and CEOs.Foundation Capital general partner Steve Vassallo saidon the firm’s blogthat Gould “would have been a giant in any industry  but she chose venture capital. We will always be grateful that she did.”Referencing her cancer near the end of her convocation speech  Gould told the graduates  “you’ll notice that I haven’t said anything about ‘live a balanced life’ or ‘live every day as if it’s your last.’ I just don’t buy that—especially for where you are in life. You need to work really hard right now  until you find your obsession  and then you’ll work even harder…but balance? Not so much.”Gould was known for putting hard work and creativity into all her obsessions  from computers to marketing to music to developing a good cabernet.She earned a BS in physics from the University of Toronto in 1973 and worked as a physicist at Argonne National Laboratory before earning her MBA from Chicago Booth in 1978. She moved to Silicon Valley and became vice president for marketing at Oracle Corporation when it had just a couple dozen of employees. She started her career in venture capital as a general partner with Merrill  Pickard  Anderson & Eyre in 1989.Soon she realized she got joy from starting companies rather than running them. She co-founded Foundation Capital  which worked with startups in their formative stages. The firm was an early investor in Netflix  Envestnet  Financial Engines and Lending Clubs  and by 2015 was managing more than $2.7 billion in funds invested across financial services  consumer computer software and other technology-based firms. She continued to mentor colleagues in venture capital after her retirement.Gould also was a private pilot and an artist. She was a talented amateur violinist who invested some of her own money to commissioning new orchestral works  benefitting composers. With her husband  Allen Stewart  Gould boughtBattle Mountain Ranchin 2009 and began a new career making premium cabernet sauvignon wine under the nameBattle Mountain Vineyard. Stewart said Gould’s planning for her final arrangements included a memorial at the Battle Mountain Ranch Chapel.“She loved the great outdoors ” Stewart said. “She once proclaimed  ‘I am much happier sleeping out in the dirt than in any fancy hotel!’” Stewart said that if he could use one word to describe his wife’s love of life and everything she did  it would be “intensity ” because that reflects how she played  lived  loved and worked.Gorno said Gould’s strength of character was evident in all the phases of her life.“Kathryn was intelligent  tenacious and fearless  possessing a remarkable inner strength that was conspicuous during her final journey ” Gorno said. “She marshaled all of these strengths in an unsparing search for excellence  not just for herself but also for others. Kathryn’s friendship was a source of inspiration  wisdom  and most importantly  limitless humor for me.”Gould is survived by her husband  Allen Stewart  and her son  Alex Gould. Stewart said the family asks for donations to the Kathryn Gould Sarcoma Research Fund through the V-Foundation  by visiting thewebsiteor by sending an email to Julie Allegro atJulie@fyrfly.vc.
                    Benjamin Wright  renowned psychometrician  1926-2015            ,Benjamin Wright came to the University of Chicago as a physicist  but his interest in social science measurement prompted him to make a drastic switch  leading to a distinguished teaching and research career in psychology  psychometrics and education. The practical and objective social measurement tools and theories that he developed are now widely applied around the world.Benjamin Drake Wright  PhD’57  professor emeritus in education and psychology at UChicago  died Oct. 25 at Warren Barr Pavilion  a Chicago nursing home. He was 89.Wright started at UChicago as a graduate student in the physics department in the fall of 1947  after obtaining his bachelor’s degree in physics at Cornell University. He took a part-time job as a counselor at UChicago’s Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School  a coeducational residential treatment program for children and adolescents in need of emotional support. His work at the school  headed byBruno Bettelheim  a renowned child psychologist and writer  motivated him to take classes in psychology and psychological measurement and to gradually switch his academic focus from physics to psychology.He obtained a certificate in psychoanalytic child care from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1954  followed by a doctorate in human development from UChicago in 1957. Upon graduation  Wright taught statistics and psychology in UChicago’s departments of education and psychology.In 1960  Danish mathematician and psychometrician George Rasch  who had developed a class of measurement models known asRasch models  was invited to UChicago to deliver a series of lectures. This sparked Wright’s strong interest in social science measurement  and led to a decade-long collaboration with Rasch.In subsequent years  Wright was largely responsible for the widespread adoption of Rasch’s measurement principles and models  which he believed offered more practical and objective methods of measuring and verifying educational  psychological and physical functioning. Wright published 150 papers on Rasch measurement; co-authored 12 books  includingBest Test DesignandRating Scale Analysis; anddirected the development of the two most widely used Rasch measurement computer programs BIGSTEPSandFacets.He ran annual workshops and taught courses on Rasch measurement beginning in 1969  and chaired 70 doctoral dissertations on that topic.“No one has done more than Wright to make a fundamental measurement theory accessible to researchers ” says William Fisher  a psychometrician who was mentored by Wright when he pursued his doctorate degree at UChicago.Nikolaus Bezruczko  another former student of Wright’s  agreed. “Ben emphasized objective knowledge  and his personal commitment was to change educational measurement and research  bringing it more in line with traditional scientific ideas ” he said. “More importantly  he understood how to develop measurement methods. His students quickly understood that he was a master at it.”Throughout his career  Wright made significant contributions to the areas of estimation  item banking  adaptive instruments  model fit analysis  models for test  rating scales and other concepts in educational testing. Wright cofounded the Institute for Objective Measurement and the Rasch Measurement Social Interest Group within the American Education Research Association.“My father was passionate about what he did and he had planned to never retire ” recalled Sara Baumrin  Wright’s daughter. “He was an amazing educator  inspiring and very accessible. He had a very good way to invest in the people that he taught  and knew what to say to encourage his students and to get them to think further.”Baumrin said her father was a lover of life  which is a secret to his longevity. Wright was an avid swimmer and loved music. He played the recorder “unbelievably well” with no formal training.In 2001  Wright suffered a stroke while he was on his way to his class. The illness incapacitated him  preventing him from his teaching and research. He took comfort in the fact that many of his students had advanced in their careers and have continued with his research.“Ben’s students appreciated his furious rejection of contemporary social research conventions  and many of them in their careers have continued to push back against them ” said Bezruczko  professor of statistics at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.Wright is survived by his children: Amy  Andrew  Christopher and Sara Baumrin; eight grandchildren and one great grandson. His wife  Claire  passed away on Dec. 30  2001.
                    Terence Turner  anthropologist and human rights advocate for indigenous people  1935-2015            ,Prof. Emeritus Terence Turner  a UChicago anthropologist who did research in the Amazon basin and became a proponent for the rights of indigenous people  died Nov. 7 in Ithaca  N.Y. He was 79.In 1962 Turner began working among the Kayapo  who live in small villages in central Brazil—returning to the area on an almost annual basis. His research covered topics such as social organization and kinship; myth  ritual and history; political organization and mobilization; values and inter-ethnic relations.His field work led to an interest in activism for the Kayapo people  who gave Turner the Kayapo name Wakampu during his earliest field visits. His wife  Jane Fajans  a professor of anthropology at Cornell University  said Turner’s activism began when the Brazilian Indian Agency asked him to investigate Brazilian nationals’ incursion into Kayapo territory for both gold mining and poaching. That activism was further fueled around opposition to the Karararao (now Belo Monte) dam in the mid 1980s  she added.“Terry Turner was both a brilliant theoretical thinker about the nature of social systems and an indefatigable ally of the indigenous people among whom he worked as an ethnographer—the Kayapo people of Brazil ” said Michael Silverstein  the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology at UChicago.“Increasingly he became a champion of the rights of the Kayapo and other indigenous peoples—not merely to survive  but to negotiate ways of flourishing as participants in the contemporary world ” Silverstein added.Activism grows out of commitment to anthropologyIn his field work  Turner saw the work of missionaries  loggers  miners and ranchers encroaching upon the Kayapo way of life. While a British TV crew was filming a documentary series in 1987 on disappearing cultures  he encouraged the Kayapo to trade access to their villages for the use of camera equipment  which they used to record their way of life.“Terry’s activism grew organically out of his commitment to anthropology ” said Prof. Adam Smith  chair of anthropology at Cornell University. “It was his long-term relationship with the Kayapo that created the kind of trust that could lead to initiatives like the video project. Terry’s thoughtful approach offers an enduring lesson for scholars and activists alike.”He helped encourage the Kayapo’s front-line activism in the global movement to protect the Amazon rainforest. In 1990  he founded the Kayapo Video Project to provide the community with film equipment and production training. This ongoing project will be honored in December with a United Nations Equator Prize at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris.In addition  Turner was a translator for a delegation of Kayapo who joined Cree people from Canada in 1992 at a conference to talk about the problems indigenous people were having with electrical power developments that threatened their environment.Silverstein said that Turner’s “devotion was returned in the most touching and heartfelt expressions of respect by his Kayapo and other allies.” In a recent letter to Turner  the Kayapo community’s leadership wrote: “You are a great warrior that taught us so much…and fought so hard for the Kayapo…Thank you for sharing your book of life with us and letting us be part of a beautiful chapter written with trust and friendship. To you  Wakampu  all of our respect and admiration.”A closer look at the KayapoBorn Dec. 30  1935 in Philadelphia  Turner received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard University in 1957  a master’s in 1959 from the University of California  Berkeley  and a PhD in 1965 in social anthropology from Harvard.He joined the UChicago faculty in 1968 after serving as a research associate at the Museo Nacional do Brasil in Rio de Janeiro and as a visiting assistant professor of social anthropology at Cornell University. In 1982  he was named professor at Chicago. He retired in 1999 and became an adjunct and later visiting professor in anthropology at Cornell.“He was an extraordinarily charismatic colleague  and one of the most intellectually gifted members of the (UChicago) Anthropology department ” said John Comaroff  a former UChicago colleague who is now a professor at Harvard.“His are among some of the best essays written in late-20th-century anthropology ” said Comaroff. He hailed Turner’s “The Social Skin ” which analyzed the significance of body decoration among the Kayapo  as “an inspirational piece—one of many that combined a conceptual tour de force with a deep respect for thick description.”A full version of “The Social Skin” was published in 1980 in the book Not Work Alone. In an article published on the topic in 1979 in the magazineNew Scientist  Turner explained how the way people choose to dress communicates meaning.He pointed out that while adult Kayapo men wear little clothing  they adorn their bodies with paint and lip plugs. “A closer look at Kayapo bodily ornament discloses that the apparently naked savage just described is as fully covered in a fabric of cultural meaning as the most elaborately draped Victorian lady or gentleman ” Turner wrote in theNew Scientist.Turner was the president of Survival International U.S.A.  a group that advocates for indigenous people  and a founding member of the American Anthropological Association’s Ethics and Human Rights Committees. In 1998  he received the Association’s Solon T. Kimball Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Application of Anthropology to Human Rights and Development Issues.In addition to his wife  he is survived by daughters Vanessa Fajans-Turner and Allison Fajans-Turner; sister Allison K. Turner; and sister-in-law Anne M. Turner.
                    Richard L. Landau  leader in endocrinology research  1916-2015            ,For more than half a century  Richard L. Landau was a demanding professor of medicine  performing path-breaking research into the effects of human hormones and treatment of hormone-related diseases  while building a world-renowned endocrinology program at the University of Chicago.Landau died Nov. 3 at Montgomery Place  an assisted living facility in Hyde Park. He was 99.“He was a towering intellect  famously irascible  an exacting teacher  a rigorous scientist and a man of impeccable ethics ” said his son-in-law  David Axelrod  director of the Institute of Politics. “He was incredibly dedicated to the University  to medical research and the care of patients. And no one loved a good argument more or tolerated pretension or phoniness less.”Widely known for his fundamental work on the effects of hormones on health and disease  Landau was an important figure in the development of modern endocrinology. For four decades  he and his colleagues characterized the metabolic effects of hormones  such as testosterone  progesterone  aldosterone and estrogen  and developed life-saving therapies.“His work led to drugs that are still used today to treat high blood pressure and heart failure ” said Edward Ehrlich  a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin  noted endocrinologist and former UChicago colleague.But Landau will be best remembered for building a nascent endocrinology program into one of the world’s best by recruiting young  talented physician-scientists—serving as their benevolent but demanding mentor  and helping them establish themselves as national leaders in the field.“Richard Landau was an outstanding physician and scientist ” said Kenneth Polonsky  dean of the Biological Sciences Division and the Pritzker School of Medicine and executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Chicago. “But perhaps his greatest contribution was his relentless and quite successful efforts  over several decades  to build a world-class program in endocrinology.”“In the ’40s  he was one of only three endocrine specialists at the University ” said Samuel Refetoff  professor of medicine at the University. “Over the next three decades  he carefully built the endocrine section into one of the top five programs in the nation  with world-renowned faculty in diabetes  thyroid  adrenal and pituitary disorders.”Landau eventually gave up his own lab to concentrate on taking care of patients and building the endocrinology section  said Leslie De Groot  professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Chicago  who was attracted to the program by Landau. “He was highly successful in recruiting the best people and enabling them to do first-rate work. He was a good and unselfish leader.”“I have always had great admiration for Richard ” said diabetes specialist Arthur Rubenstein  who was hired by Landau in 1967 and went on to become chairman of medicine at the University of Chicago and then dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school. “He was a wonderful role model  charismatic  irreverent and down to earth. He could make junior colleagues  like his new recruits  feel at home. At the same time  he could bring important people down to size.”A lifelong pursuitInspired by Paul de Kruif’s classic book Microbe Hunters  Landau resolved at a young age to pursue a career in medicine.Upon his graduation from Washington University in St. Louis in 1940  Landau came to the University of Chicago for a three-year residency that would lead to a lifelong association. During this period  he began working in the laboratory of endocrine specialist Allan Kenyon  who demonstrated the connections between testosterone and muscle growth.After serving as a physician in World War II’s Pacific theater  and upon his discharge with the rank of captain in 1946  Landau returned to the University of Chicago as an instructor in medicine. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1948  associate professor in 1952 and professor in 1959.He was named program director of the University’s Clinical Research Center in 1961 and associate chairman of medicine in 1962. In 1966  he officially became chief of the endocrinology section.Concerned about the ethical issues posed by clinical research  Landau also was appointed as the first chairman of the medical center’s Institutional Review Board—the group that monitors all research involving human subjects—a position he held for many years.Despite his success at recruiting and retaining outstanding investigators  Landau was not someone who immediately impressed sensitive acquaintances as a natural team builder. Colleagues recall him as forceful  difficult—sometimes abrasive. Yet  he consistently developed productive relationships and commanded enduring admiration and loyalty from his team.“He could be quite opinionated ” Refetoff said. “As a section chief  he was simultaneously autocratic and democratic. He told you what he thought in a straightforward way. He tried to convince you. He would listen carefully to your response. Then he would decide.”Landau published more than 90 papers and served as a member of the editorial board at theJournal of the American Medical Association. He also served as editor ofPerspectives in Biology and Medicine  a journal  published by the University of Chicago and managed for 28 years by his wife Claire. (It is now based at Johns Hopkins University).After closing his research laboratory  he continued to teach  speak and write. His later publications were primarily review articles  editorials and opinion pieces—some biting  some amusing  but always thoughtful.In 1985  he was awarded the Gold Key Award for outstanding and loyal service to the University. He retired in 1987  but he continued to meet weekly with his colleagues in the endocrine section well into his 90s until his health began failing.Landau’s wife  Claire  died in 2002. Two sons  Thomas and James  also preceded him in death. He is survived by two daughters  Susan Axelrod (and her husband David) and Kay Fricke (and her husband Karl); five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.Memorial donations may bemade onlineto the Museum of Science and Industry to support science teacher professional development courses or mailed to M. Fishback  5700 South Lake Shore Dr.  Chicago  IL 60637.A memorial service will be held at a later date.
                    Charles Rubin  pediatric cancer specialist  1953-2015            ,Assoc. Prof. Charles M. Rubin  a highly respected specialist in the care of children with cancer and a role model for medical students  residents and established physicians  died July 17. He was 62.Rubin had just arrived at the pediatric clinic Friday afternoon at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center at Silver Cross Hospital in suburban New Lenox when his heart stopped. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful.An authority on all aspects of pediatric cancers  Rubin had a particular interest in brain tumors and cancer occurring in children with genetic syndromes. He combined considerable experience in basic laboratory research on the genetics of cancer with broad clinical expertise and an inborn talent for informing  calming  comforting  motivating and inspiring patients and their families.“I can’t put into words how much I respected him ” said his colleague Tara Henderson  associate professor of pediatrics and director of the Childhood Cancer Survivors Center at the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Hospital. “He was amazingly knowledgeable  compassionate and thoughtful—traits at the core of our program. I take his influence with me as I care for my patients.”“He could also be funny  with a dry  quiet sense of humor. We never knew when it was coming ” Henderson said. “We miss him dearly.”The head of pediatrics remembered Rubin for his trusted guidance and his ability to put patients and colleagues at ease.“Chuck was highly respected by his research and clinical colleagues and was a popular mentor—not only for many medical students and pediatric residents  but also for fellows and junior faculty ” said John Cunningham  the Donald N. Pritzker Professor and interim chair of Pediatrics. “Even his senior colleagues sought his ideas and counsel frequently on complex pediatric oncology and hematology problems.”“He also introduced what we called ‘social moments ’ ” Cunningham said. “Just before each clinic  he would have everyone briefly mention something fun they had done recently with friends or family. It put the team at ease and helped connect us with each other.”Born Feb. 10  1953  in Long Branch  N.J.  Rubin earned his bachelor’s degree with highest honors from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975 and his medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in 1979. He completed his pediatric residency at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in 1982  followed by a fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology at the University of Minnesota in 1985.He came to the University of Chicago in 1985 as a cytogenetics and molecular biology fellow in the laboratory of Prof. Janet Rowley  an internationally recognized pioneer in understanding the genetics of cancer. Rubin joined the faculty as an assistant professor of pediatrics and medicine and a member of the Cancer Research Center in 1987. In 1991  he and adult oncologist Funmi Olopade  co-founded UChicago’s nationally recognized Cancer Risk Clinic.“Chuck Rubin was one of the finest individuals I have ever known ” said Michelle Le Beau  a former colleague and now director of the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center. “He was a consummate academician and physician who blended compassion and sensitivity with brilliant clinical acumen. His dedication to his family  his patients and the University of Chicago was selfless and unparalleled. It was a privilege to work with him and an honor to learn from his example.”Although he continued to work closely with his basic science colleagues  contributing to more than 50 original reports in academic journals  his interests increasingly focused on patient care—at which he excelled.At the same time  he took on several administrative roles. He served as course director for pediatric grand rounds and the medical center’s pediatric tumor board. He directed the pediatric hematology/oncology fellowship for seven years and the pediatric neuro-oncology program for 10 years. He also volunteered for medical staff positions in various educational and rehabilitative summer camps for children with cancer.Rubin also was a leader in the University of Chicago Medicine’s efforts to take a research-driven approach to pediatric cancer care into the community  serving as director of pediatric hematology/oncology outreach since 2008. Accomplishments in this area include extending pediatric oncology care to three sites in the southern suburbs and his recent appointment as physician director for University of Chicago Pediatrics outreach efforts at Edward-Elmhurst Healthcare in Naperville.In 1988  Rubin’s clinical achievements and popularity with patients caught the attention of the medical center’s media relations specialist for pediatrics  Gretchen Flock. They married in 1989. Together  they raised four daughters  including Gretchen’s daughter Elizabeth from a previous marriage.Rubin is survived by his wife  Gretchen; their daughters  Elizabeth  Jane  Lucy and Claire; brothers Michael  Peter and Richard; and many nieces and nephews.A wake will be held from 3 to 8:30 p.m. July 21  at Hallowell & James Funeral Home  1025 W. 55th St. in Countryside  and a service at 10 a.m. Wednesday  July 22  at St. Francis Xavier Church  124 N. Spring Ave.  La Grange  followed by burial at Bronswood Cemetery in Oak Brook. Donations may be made to the Charles M. Rubin Memorial Fund  Department of Pediatrics  University of Chicago  5721 S.

                    Selwyn W. Becker  social psychologist and dedicated mentor  1929–2021            ,Selwyn W. Becker  a social psychologist and longtime faculty member at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business  died June 15 in Glenview  Illinois. He was 92.A professor emeritus of psychology and quality management  Becker spent nearly four decades teaching at Booth  mentoring many students even after they left campus. His research focused on management and innovation in businesses  often through a lens of human behavior.“He was a very strong believer in the human side of organizations ” said Robert Kenmore  MBA’93  PhD’02  who studied with Becker while completing his degrees at Booth and remained friends with him long after. “In business school  it’s generally about numbers  but he was very much about qualifying numbers with words.”Becker was born in 1929 in Salem  Massachusetts  to Polish Jewish immigrants. After military service  he attended the University of Rochester on a GI bill. There  he met his future wife  Gloria  through a blind date. Later  Becker attended the University of Minnesota for his master’s degree and Pennsylvania State University for his doctorate in psychology. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University before joining Booth’s faculty in 1959.Becker’s1967 paperin theJournal of Business co-authored with the late Booth professorThomas L. Whistler  examined innovation as an organizational and social process  setting the groundwork for further exploration by fellow academics. In that paper  Becker and Whistler defined innovation “as the first or early use of an idea by one of a set of organizations with similar goals.” They explored the idea of innovation as something distinct from organizational change and adaptation  and attempted to explain “what predisposes or equips an organization to be first—to be the leader.”Becker also worked alongside the late Booth professorHarry V. Roberts  developing the curriculum for the total quality management movement at the school. Between 1985 and 1996  Becker taught courses on small group processes and managing in organizations.“He was very direct and very straightforward and always with a smile ” said Sam Peltzman  the Ralph and Dorothy Keller Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics  who first met Becker as a Booth doctoral student and later interacted with him on the faculty.During his time at Booth  Becker took the opportunity to travel as part of his teaching career. The family  including his wife and three children  spent time in Venezuela and Portugal  as well as at the University of California  Berkeley  taking advantage of Becker’s sabbaticals and trips teaching abroad.“Now I feel very lucky  but as a child I wondered why we couldn’t just go to Disney World ” said his daughter  Amy Becker Zimmerman. When back home  Zimmerman said her father was known for hosting poker games with Booth luminaries  including Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and former Secretary of State and Chicago Booth dean George Shultz.As a devoted parent and grandparent  Becker published the 2003 bookTeenagers’ Dilemmas and Opportunities: A Social Psychologist Writes to His Grandchildren. His goal was to provide a framework for his own children and grandchildren to engage each other about issues related to growing up. The text was not easily digested by the younger generation  his daughter admits  but did help spark some serious conversations. “Both of my kids read the book and said  ‘Boy  that is so Grandpa ’” Zimmerman said.Becker’s son  Michael  echoed his sister’s recollections of their father’s support and dedication. “He always taught us by example  to think for ourselves and make our own path in life ” he said. “His curiosity in all subjects was infectious as well.”Even after his retirement in 1996  Becker considered the University of Chicago a second home.“He could not leave the university. He was always there talking and meeting people ” Zimmerman recalled. “He loved being there and he loved that setting.”In his 70s and 80s  Becker was a frequent visitor to the faculty’s emeritus suite and would ride his bike to campus. Linda Ginzel  clinical professor of managerial psychology  often met Becker for lunch or coffee when he made these trips. “He was always giving me advice ” Ginzel said.In her own book Choosing Leadership  Ginzel shared Becker’s powerful story of actively resisting racism during World War II. While he was stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey  Becker joined the military band and recruited a Black piano player. When they showed up for a gig at the Officers’ Club  one officer tried to bar the piano player’s entrance. Becker stood up to him  asserting “it was all or none of us ” and “there wouldn’t be any music for the dance” that night.“It took courage for an enlisted man to stand up to an officer ” Ginzel wrote in her book. “Sel’s choice to keep his band together demonstrated his deeply held value of equality. … And with his choice  Sel desegregated the Officers’ Club  at least on that evening.”Becker is survived by his brother Harold; his three children  Amy  Joe and Michael; and five grandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife Gloria  who died in April 2020.—This story was first published by theBooth School of Business.
                    Yoichiro Nambu  Nobel-winning theoretical physicist  1921-2015            ,Physicist Yoichiro Nambu once said he came to the University of Chicago in 1954 because of the “many great names” in physics at the University  including Nobel laureates such as Enrico Fermi. Nambu became a major figure in his own right during his long tenure at UChicago  culminating inwinning a share of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physicsfor his theory about the workings of the subatomic world.Nambu  94  died on July 5 in Osaka  Japan  after an acute heart attack. His death was announced July 17 by Osaka University  where he also served as a professor.“The legacy that Yoichiro Nambu established in theoretical physics research has had a profound impact on generations of researchers around the world  and at the University of Chicago in particular ” said President Robert J. Zimmer. “He was a generous and humane colleague who led by example. We will always be grateful for the historic intellectual contributions that he made here.”Nambu’s colleagues at the University said he would be remembered as a pivotal theorist who remained kind and soft-spoken as his research earned ever more accolades.
                    John F. Mullan  pioneer of neurosurgery  1925-2015            ,John ‘Sean’ Mullan  the John Harper Seely Professor Emeritus in Surgery at the University of Chicago  died from lung cancer on June 4  surrounded by family members at his home in Hyde Park. He was 90 years old.Mullan was a pioneer in the development of 20th-century neurosurgery. In the 1960s he developed minimally invasive methods to improve the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases  including novel ways to seal off arteriovenousmalformationsor aneurysms using electrical currents delivered through a needle  or by packing the abnormality with tiny copper coils  blocking blood flow through the distorted vessel. Variations on techniques he developed are now routinely performed by interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons.Mullan’s efforts “spawned a vast body of work that has culminated in the use of intravascular coagulative techniques for the management of vascular malformations throughout the world ” according to his UChicago colleagues Barry Arnason and Bryce Weir. “Innumerable frightened people have sought Sean Mullan’s counsel. Many have left cured ” they wrote in an article tied to Mullan’s retirement in 1992. “All have left with a better understanding of their problem  and with that intangible commodity—hope.”In 1983  Mullan and colleague Terry Lichtor publishedresultsfrom the first 50 cases of another a new procedure—percutaneous balloon compression—in which they inserted a tiny expandable balloon to disrupt severe pain signals involving the trigeminal nerve. The procedure  they wrote  “involves little discomfort and only a brief hospitalization for the patient; it is not associated with mortality and has  up to the present  a relatively low incidence of recurrence.”The balloon catheter—now known as the Mullan percutaneous trigeminal ganglion microcompression set  produced by Indiana-based Cook Vascular  Inc.—is still in use.Mullan also developed and popularized the trans-oral approach for surgical problems located near the base of the skull. He devised a minimally invasive system to retrieve blood clots as a treatment for stroke. And he performed important basic research on the consequences of internal bleeding on the nervous system.In the late 1950s and ‘60s  Mullan worked closely with colleagues in the University’s federally funded Argonne Cancer Research Hospital to devise and test a series of novel approaches to treat cancers of the head  neck and spine by inserting radioactive coils  wires or needles directly into or around a tumor.As an administrator  he was a key player in the creation of the Brain Research Institute at the University of Chicago. He served as its first director from 1964 to 1984. He helped convince the Brain Research Foundation  a group of philanthropists interested in nervous-system diseases  to build the 50 000 square foot facility devoted to brain research that opened on campus in 1978.“Sean Mullan was a superb physician and mentor  soft-spoken  compassionate  communicative and gentle with patients—who revered him ” said Issam Awad  the current the Harper Seeley Professor  who came to the University of Chicago in large part because of Mullan’s legacy. “His trainees and coworkers attest that he worked long hours  checking on patients in the middle of the night if necessary  but he also managed to get home most evenings for dinner at 7 with his family.”“When appropriate  however  he could be tough as steel ” Awad said. “He ran a strict  no-nonsense operating room. That was the only place he ever was heard to swear.”Sean Francis Mullan was born May 17  1925  in Dungiven  County Derry  Northern Ireland. He graduated from St. Columb’s College  Derry and Queen’s University medical school  in Belfast. He completed his internship at Royal Victoria Hospital  followed by residency training in Belfast and London  and a neurosurgical residency with Penfield Wilder  a leader in the field  at the Montreal Neurological Institute.In 1955  Mullan came to the University of Chicago as an assistant professor of neurological surgery. He rose quickly through the ranks to associate professor in 1959 and professor in 1963. He served as section chief of neurological surgery from 1967 to 1992  including two years  from 1970 to 1972  as acting chairman of the Department of Surgery.During this time he published more than 180 scholarly papers—primarily focused on cerebrovascular issues  pain-relief procedures and the clinical use of isotopes—as well as more than 30 book chapters and a 1961 textbook onEssentials of Neurosurgery for Students and Practitioners.He received multiple honors. In 1961 he received the McClintock teaching prize in from the University of Chicago. He was the first recipient of the Herbert Olivecrona Award from Sweden’s Karolinska Institute  in 1976. He received the Penfield medal of Canada in 1979 and the Jamieson Medal of Australia in 1980. He served as a visiting professor at universities in Sweden  Australia  New Zealand  South Africa and Lebanon.In 1985 he was elected president of the Society of Neurological Surgeons  the field’s most august professional group. He served as assistant secretary (1981 to ‘89)  secretary (1989 to ‘93) and honorary president of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies.“His greatness  one of the reasons so many people admired him  was because he didn’t show off ” said his colleague  Javad Hekmatpanah  professor of surgery at the University of Chicago. “He did what he preached. Residents saw him not just as a teacher but as a role model. Those who trained with him tried hard to be like him.”He met his wife  Vivian Dunn  a former neurosurgery nurse  in Chicago and they married in 1959. They have three children  all physicians. Joan Mullan is an internal medicine specialist at Northwestern University  John is a Minneapolis-based neurosurgeon and Brian is a clinical professor of radiology for University of Iowa Health Care. All three graduated from the Pritzker School of Medicine.In retirement  Mullan enjoyed spending time at his walnut-tree farm in Michigan and visiting his family’s ancestral land in Ireland. He frequently attended neurosurgery symposia  welcoming visiting professors with his typical insights and wit.Services have been held.
                    Norman W. Ingham  scholar of medieval Slavic literature  1934-2015            ,Prof. Emeritus Norman W. Ingham  a meticulous and erudite scholar of medieval Slavic literature  died April 27 in Wilbraham  Mass. He was 80.Ingham’s expertise spanned languages and time periods: He spoke Polish  Russian  Czech  Spanish  English  French  Italian  Old Church Slavonic and Greek  and studied 18-century Russian literature as well as early Slavic literature and folklore. He also wrote extensively on the works of Gogl  Turgenev and Tolstoy.“He was broadly and deeply educated ” remembered his friend and colleague Valentina Pichugin  senior lecturer in Slavic Languages and Literatures.Born in Granby  Mass. on Dec. 31  1934  Ingham never lost his love of New England. Throughout his life  he looked forward to summers at his house in Massachusetts.“I’m going home ” he would tell friends and colleagues in Chicago at the end of each school year.Ingham received his BA from Middlebury College in 1957. He went on to study at the University of Michigan  where he received an MA in 1959  and Harvard  where he earned a PhD in 1963. During his graduate training  Ingham studied abroad at Leningrad State University  the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and the Charles University in Prague.After stints at Harvard and Indiana University  Ingham joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1971. During his time at UChicago  he edited monographs includingThe Church and Religious Culture in Old Rus’and authoredE.T.A. Hoffman’s Reception in Russia  as well as numerous journal articles. Ingham retired in 2006.He made a lasting impact on his field as the organizer for nearly two decades of the Midwest Medieval Slavic Workshop  which continues today. Ingham insisted on cordial but rigorous discussion  resulting in debates between participants that Pichugin described as “pure intellectual bliss.”In his own appearances at the workshop  Ingham was known to recite long sections of Slavic literature from memory—and end his presentations exactly on time without ever glancing at the clock.As a teacher  Ingham balanced his high expectations with warmth and humanity  even taking time to work with struggling students outside of class until they mastered the material.His former student Sonia Ketchian remembered Ingham was “magnificently organized as he presented lectures with clarity  precision and relevant humor  while remaining ever attentive to student reaction and participation. Norman truly and actively encouraged independent thinking from his students. Writing a paper for him was a joy because the student could be certain of careful attention  objective evaluation and constructive corrections ” she wrote in an email.Dryly witty and impeccably polite  Ingham was “an ideal colleague ” according to Pichugin. He made special efforts to welcome new colleagues  inviting them to his regular table in the Quadrangle Club for lunch.In his spare time  Ingham developed a passion for genealogy and wrote a book on his family’s history.He also enjoyed watching sports and old movies  collecting stamps and Harry Potter memorabilia  and listening to opera.Ingham is survived by two nieces  Patricia Gelinas and Judith Ingham; and five nephews  Lewis  Bill  Earl  Richard and Larry Ingham. Services have been held.
                    Norman H. Nie  leading scholar of American political behavior and public opinion  1943–2015            ,Norman H. Nie  a political scientist and inventor of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences  or SPSS  computer software technology that changed the way social scientists analyze data  died April 2  one day after his 72nd birthday. Nie had lung cancer.Working with two computer scientist friends in 1968  Nie created SPSS to automate the analysis of quantitative data for his own dissertation.“SPSS was a pioneer in the development of software for statistical analysis in the social sciences  and the program was widely used in academia  the media and business ” said John Mark Hansen  the Charles L. Hutchinson Distinguished Service Professor in political science. “At one time  Norman was the most cited political scientist by an order of magnitude because of references to SPSS.”“SPSS was a real game-changer because of its ability to handle large data sets and to track a lot of variables ” said Norman Bradburn  the Tiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in psychology  senior fellow at NORC at the University of Chicago and the former director of NORC when Nie started his academic career there.Nie served as CEO of SPSS from 1975 to 1992  and continued as chairman of the board until 2008. SPSS was sold to IBM for $1.2 billion after Nie left the board. “As long as Norman was involved in SPSS  it continued to address developments for social science research ” Bradburn said  but after the sale  “SPSS became more commercial and not as focused on academic research.”Nie was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009 in recognition of his scholarship on U.S. political behavior and public opinion and his role in the creation of infrastructures for social scientific research. At Chicago  he co-authored four major books in political science Participation in America: Political Democracy and Social Equality The Changing American Voter Participation and Political EqualityandEducation and Democratic Citizenship in America  along with dozens of articles.Considered a landmark study Participation in Americaintroduced the idea of “modes” of political involvement  uncovered the role of education in promoting participation and explored the way group solidarity and political institutions support political activism.The Changing American Voteropened an important debate about the impact of political change on the beliefs of the American electorate. In much of his work  Nie collaborated with Sidney Verba  his thesis adviser at Stanford and faculty colleague at Chicago.Nie joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1968  at age 25  and advanced rapidly up the ranks  earning promotion to tenure in 1972 and to professor in 1977. He served twice as department chair and retired in 1998. He then took an appointment at Stanford University  where he had earned his PhD in 1970. A native of St. Louis  Nie received his bachelor’s degree from Washington University in 1964.Bradburn described Nie as being very energetic and a man who enjoyed life. The family’sobituaryfor Nie offered this description: “Nie mentored hundreds of students throughout his career and was often described by colleagues as a force of nature; a man of vast energy and ambition; omnivorous curiosity  deep intellect  immense creativity and everyday humanity.”One student who calls Nie a mentor  colleague and friend is Jane Junn  AM’87  PhD’94  who is now a professor of political science at the University of Southern California. Junn said she started working with Nie in 1985 as a research assistant. She co-authored a book with him in 1996 that won the prestigious Woodrow Wilson Award  and they remained colleagues and friends. “Norman was fun to be with  hilarious...a very loyal friend and always in your corner  even beyond the academic setting ” said Junn. “He was a great listener and always open to new ideas.”Nie was also the recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the American Association of Public Opinion Research in recognition of his contributions to the use and methodology of opinion surveys.In 1998  Nie co-founded Knowledge Networks  an Internet survey research firm where he was chairman of the board. He was also the CEO of Revolution Analytics  a commercial software company  and served on the boards of numerous technology firms.“Norman really had two careers ” said Hansen. “His scholarship on political participation was one of the foundational contributions to the field. It won awards and is a staple of course syllabi and research bibliographies. His activities as a business entrepreneur at SPSS and then Knowledge Networks were also enormously influential.” Hansen added  “Either career would be recognized as significant; that Norman had both is just incredible.”Nie is survived by his wife of 51 years  Carol  daughters Anne Nie  Lara Slotwiner-Nie  son-in-law Peter Slotwiner-Nie  and granddaughters Sophia Slotwiner-Nie and Helena Slotwiner-Nie.A private burial was held in St. Louis and a public memorial will be held at a later date.
                    Donald Levine  sociologist and former dean of the College  1931-2015            ,Whether he was teaching his students about sociology through martial arts or leading them to the Point during the University’s annual Kuvia celebration  Prof. Donald Levine believed in education without boundaries.“[T]he intense communication that flourishes here occurs well beyond the classroom ” Levine told entering College students at Opening Convocation in 1982. In the years to come  he said  they would learn everywhere: “in the residence halls  at the supermarket  on the playing fields  inside the coffeehouses and on the streets of Hyde Park.”Levine  the Peter B. Ritzma Professor Emeritus of Sociology  died on April 4 after a long illness. He was 83.An adventurous and open-minded intellectual  Levine  AB’50  AM’57  PhD’57  made wide-ranging contributions to the field of sociology  alongside his lasting impact on the University as dean of the College from 1982-87.John W. Boyer  current dean of the College  said Levine served “brilliantly” in that position.“As an alumnus of the College and later as a prominent faculty leader  Don was a strong and passionate advocate for student rights and student welfare  and a firm believer in the power and efficacy of general education as a defining principle of the College’s educational programs ” Boyer said.“I’m on very good terms with the dean”As dean  Levine reaffirmed the importance of the College’s liberal arts education. “[E]ven from a practical point of view of occupational success in later life  the best thing you can do is acquire a wide range of intellectual abilities ” he told theChicago Sun-Timesin 1982.He used his deanship to draw attention to the non-academic aspects of College life as well. Levine worked to expand the academic advising program  strengthen the residential house system and encourage students to venture outside Hyde Park. He attracted national attention for his decision to change the school’s official song to replace “sons” and “men” with gender-inclusive terms like “children” and “us.”With several colleagues  he created the College’s annual wintertime festival  Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko  which began in 1983. The celebration was  in many ways  a reflection of Levine’s seemingly indefatigable good humor. “You can’t change the weather  but you can change your perception of it ” Levine said. “We wanted to blast away winter doldrums with some fun.”Kuvia also honored Levine’s belief that education should cultivate both body and mind. A fourth-degree black belt in Aikido  Levine taught a College course that incorporated sociological theories of conflict resolution along with a weekly three-hour “lab” focused on the theory and practice of the Japanese martial art.Levine  then dean of the College  knew the course seemed unconventional to some  but “I’m on very good terms with the dean of the College  you see ” he said.Intellectual dialogueIn his own undergraduate days  Levine met the renowned philosopher Richard McKeon  whose work on pluralism shaped Levine’s open-minded approach to sociology and social theory.Over his long career  Levine published several works that are now considered landmarks of sociology. His “masterpiece ” according to former student Charles Camic  wasVisions of the Sociological Tradition published by the University of Chicago Press in 1995.In that book  Levine traced the intellectual genealogy of the social sciences and argued that different traditions of social thought could productively inform one another. “It’s a brilliant analysis of theories and intellectual traditions  but also a very thoughtful effort to bring them into intellectual dialogue with one another ” said Camic  PhD’79  now a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. “The beauty with which it’s argued and the depth of his knowledge about these different intellectual traditions are astounding.”Levine was also influential in promoting the work of German sociologist Georg Simmel and translated several of Simmel’s works into English. “He brought Simmel to awareness in the U.S. ” said Douglas Mitchell  a longtime editor at the University of Chicago Press  who worked with Levine throughout his career.As a young scholar  Levine spent several years doing fieldwork in Ethiopia  which resulted in his first book Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture. In 2004  Andreas Eshete  the president of Addis Ababa University  calledWax and Gold“an Ethiopian classic.”Levine remained interested in Ethiopia throughout his life and served as an advisor on Ethiopia to the U.S. Senate  Department of State and other federal agencies. In 1999  he publishedGreater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society  an interdisciplinary study of Ethiopian history.Levine used his experiences as dean of the College to inform his 2006 book Powers of the Mind: The Reinvention of Liberal Learning in America in which he explored the history of undergraduate education at UChicago and proposed ways to keep liberal education relevant in the modern world. “That’s one I think people will keep coming back to  more and more ” said Levine’s former student Dan Silver  PhD’08  now a professor at the University of Toronto.Ethiopia  martial arts  intellectual history  pedagogy—the breadth of Levine’s interest and his openness to new ideas set him apart  colleagues and students say. “He was a great believer in different approaches in the hope that each could be enriched by the others ” Camic said. “I think it also came out of a deeper moral belief in the importance of human dialogue across all lines.”Levine brought that spirit to his work as a teacher. Rigorous but never doctrinaire  Levine encouraged students to follow their own interests wherever they led. “His goal as a teacher was to produce students from whom he could learn later ” Silver said.At the end of his life  Levine was at work on a book on the role of dialogue in social theory  according to his longtime friend and UChicago PhD student Jonathan Baskin. Baskin was surprised that Levine was trying to finish another book during his illness  but quickly realized the project brought Levine joy in his last months. “For me  it was inspiring to see someone who really did what he loved to the end ” Baskin said.An embodiment of the UChicago spiritLevine’s colleagues and collaborators remember him for his generosity  thoughtfulness and positive outlook. Despite his many commitments  he was never too busy to read a former student’s work or send an email of praise. Mitchell remembers Levine making a surprise appearance at his most recent birthday party  flowers  card and balloons in hand—a memory that  for Mitchell  captures both Levine’s kindness and his game-for-anything sense of spontaneity.“He lived in a way that expressed his commitment and love for ideas ” Baskin said. “He was one of the embodiments of the University of Chicago spirit for me. He expressed so many of its best qualities.”Donald Levine is survived by his wife  Ruth Levine; his children  Rachel Levine  William Levine and Theodore Levine; and his grandchildren  Natanyel Bohm-Levine  Zoe Melnick and Ari Melnick.A memorial service will be held on April 9  1 p.m. at KAM Isaiah Israel Congregation  1100 E. Hyde Park Blvd. Shiva will be at the Levine residence on April 9 and 11  from 6 to 8:30 p.m. with a minyan at 7 p.m. both nights. Memorial contributions may be made to the Nature Conservancy or the Jacob J. Weinstein Fund of KAM Isaiah Israel.
                    Melvin Gordon  Tootsie Roll CEO and supporter of research at UChicago  1919-2015            ,Melvin Gordon  longtime CEO of Chicago-based Tootsie Roll Industries  died this week at the age of 95. He ran the candy maker for more than 50 years and never technically retired  becoming the oldest serving CEO of any business listed on either U.S. stock exchange.Gordon and his wife  Ellen  were also longtime supporters of scientific research at the University of Chicago. In 2006  they donated $25 million toward the construction of what is now known as the Ellen and Melvin Gordon Center for Integrative Science. The Gordon Center  located at 929 E. 57th St. on campus  is known for its beautiful atrium and bridge that straddles the northern entrance to the science quad. It brings together faculty and research from the Biological and Physical Sciences  and prestigious research institutes  including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute  the James Franck Institute and the Institute for Biophysical Dynamics.At the time of the gift  Ellen Gordon said  “We all dream of a day when there is less suffering and pain in the world. Thanks to institutions like the University of Chicago we have made enormous progress toward that day  but there is still much more to do. In business  Melvin and I look for the best return on our investment. In philanthropy  we also look for the best return and are therefore pleased to be a part of this wondrous collaborative research that can make life better for many people.”“There is such visionary leadership  and the scientific track record is so extraordinary ” she continued. “They have made so many important discoveries. The payback will be great as the promise of a greater—and sweeter—future becomes a reality for so many.”In 2008  the Gordons were named Honorary Fellows of the Division of Biological Sciences. Students  faculty  staff and visitors will remember their contributions as they pass through the lobbies of the Gordon Center  which to this day are stocked with bowls of a never-ending supply of Tootsie Roll products.
                    Harry Fozzard  pioneer in study of cardiac muscle activity  1931-2014            ,Harry A. Fozzard  a pioneer in understanding chemical and electrical signaling in heart muscle cells  passed away in his sleep Dec. 9 at his home in Dana  N.C. He was 83.Fozzard  the Otho S.A. Sprague Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Medicine  helped lay the foundation for modern clinical electrophysiology by mapping out the structure and function of the voltage-gated ion channels in heart muscle. These membrane proteins mediate fast communication in heart muscle. They generate the rhythm  coordinating and controlling cardiac contraction. Abnormalities in this system are responsible for several cardiac-arrhythmia diseases and sudden cardiac death.Fozzard was “a world leader in cardiac electrophysiology ” according to the American Heart Association  which honored him in 2005. His research  which helped lay the foundations for modern clinical electrophysiology  was distinguished by its “innovativeness  rigor  sophistication and broad impact.”The Fozzard laboratory perfected ion-selective microelectrodes for monitoring intact cells. They characterized the role of sodium and calcium channels and the enzyme sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase  which pumps sodium out and potassium into heart muscle cells  a process that regulates intracellular ion concentrations  which control the heartbeat.They also led structure-function studies of the cloned cardiac sodium channel  using molecular modeling and guided mutations to understand how the channels were controlled and how they could be manipulated.Fozzard was part of a distinguished team recruited by Hans Hecht  chief of cardiology at the University in the late 1960s  to work closely with clinicians to learn more about cardiac diseases and to use that knowledge to develop more effective therapies.“When I first arrived as a postdoctoral student in his lab in the early 1980s  he was he was just about the only person around doing ion-channel electrophysiology ” said Dorothy Hanck  professor of medicine at the University. “He trained with one of the founders of the field and then  during this long career  served as mentor to more than 60 PhD and MD/PhD candidates  postdoctoral fellows and scientists on sabbatical.”“He had a vision ” Hanck said. “He knew how to build a program  how to make it a success. And somehow he managed to keep up with his clinical work. Most people outside the medical center think of him as a basic scientist  but he was also a very good doctor.”Fozzard was the author or co-author of nearly 250 original papers  reviews  editorials and book chapters. He earned continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health for his research for more than four decades. In 1966  he helped secure the University’s first cardiovascular sciences training grant from the NIH  one of the oldest and most successful such grants in the country. It remains active today  under the direction of James Liao  cardiology section chief at the University of Chicago.A valued teacher and cherished colleagueHarry Allen Fozzard was born April 22  1931  in Jacksonville  Fla. He attended Washington and Lee University  in Lexington  Va.  for three years  where he met his wife  Lyn Lane  who attended nearby Sweet Briar College. In 1952  he entered the Washington University School of Medicine  where two of his teachers—Earl Sutherland Jr. and Robert Furchgott—went on to win Nobel Prizes.He graduated in 1956  completed an internship in internal medicine at Yale University and went on to two years of active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps and residency training at Washington University’s Barnes Hospital. He then completed fellowships in cardiology at Washington University and in cardiac electrophysiology at the University of Bern  where he learned cardiac electrophysiology and developed a voltage clamp to measure electrical currents in cardiac cells.In 1964  he was appointed assistant professor of medicine and physiology at Washington University  where he established and directed the first coronary care unit at Barnes Hospital. Working with engineering colleagues there  he pioneered a digital computer system for real-time arrhythmia monitoring.In 1966  he came to the University of Chicago as an associate professor of medicine and director of the myocardial infarction research unit. He was promoted to professor in 1971 and named co-section chief  with Leon Resnekov  of cardiology. During this period he directed the biomedical computer facility  the cystic fibrosis research center and theCommittee on Cell Physiology. From 1990 to 1998  he chaired the Department of Pharmacological & Physiological Sciences. In 1998  he took emeritus status.Fozzard’s contributions to the field of electrophysiology brought many accolades. He was vice-president for research  editor-in-chief ofCirculation Researchand on the board of directors for the American Heart Association. That group presented him with their Award of Merit in 1983 and their Distinguished Scientist Award in 2005.He served on the editorial boards forCirculation theAmerican Journal of Physiology theAmerican Journal of Cardiologyand on the board of reviewing editors forScience. He was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the Association of American Physicians and the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He was chairman of several NIH study sections  a Fulbright Scholar at the University of the Republic in Montevideo  Uruguay  where he was awarded an honorary doctorate  and a Litchfield Professor at Oxford University in 1991.He was a valued teacher to countless college  graduate and medical students. And he was  for decades  a cherished colleague that heart specialists and others turned to for both clinical and scientific advice.“He was a true gentleman  sound in judgment and principles—and one of my favorite people ” said his friend Frank Fitch  the Albert D. Lasker Professor Emeritus in Pathology and the Ben May Department of Cancer Research at the University. “I was glad to have him represent me in institutional politics. He always seemed to be on the right side  and for the right reasons.”Away from the laboratory  Fozzard was a competitive sailboat racer on Lake Michigan and an enthusiastic mountain climber. He also had a talent for scherenschnitte  or scissor cuts  a 16th century Swiss-German folk art. His wife Lyn helped start the first Meridian Hospice  to provide end-of-life care for people on the South Side of Chicago.After he retired  the Fozzards moved to his wife’s hometown in the mountains of western North Carolina  where he volunteered at a free clinic and at the Environmental & Conservation Organization. He also served on the NC State Board on Clinical Psychology and he and his wife volunteered as screeners with Pisgah Legal Services. Most recently  he joined the Apple Valley Model Railroad Club.His death is a “huge loss for the whole field ” said cardiologist Jafar Al-Sadir  professor of medicine  who came to the university to study with Fozzard.“He was remarkable  the smartest guy I have ever seen ” Al-Sadir said. “You could count on him to think outside the box on any problem. He routinely suggested solutions no one else would have thought of. Since I first heard of his passing  it has been hard for me to get him off of my mind.”Fozzard is survived by his wife  Lyn Lane; their two sons  Richard (wife Jan) and Peter (Elizabeth); four grandchildren; his brother George (Veronica) and a nephew  Harry. Funeral arrangements are not yet complete. In lieu of flowers  donations could be sent to the MR Lane Fund of the Community Foundation of Western North Carolina  at 4 Vanderbilt Park Drive  No. 300  Asheville N.C. 28803.
                    Willard Manning  a leading researcher in health economics  1946-2014            ,Willard G. Manning Jr.  a leading researcher in health economics  died at British Home Rehabilitation in Brookfield  Ill. on Nov. 25. He was 68.Manning taught at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and in the Department of Public Health Sciences before his retirement in 2011.“Will was a beloved professor and an extraordinary researcher ” said Daniel Diermeier  dean of Chicago Harris. “In his distinguished career  he made many important contributions to our understanding of health insurance  poor health habits and mental health. We will miss a dear colleague and dedicated teacher.”“What made Will stand out was not only the importance and rigor of his research but also the seriousness with which he approached his responsibilities as a member of the University and the larger academic community ” said Diane Lauderdale  professor of epidemiology and chair of Public Health Sciences. “The time and thought he put into mentoring junior faculty  advising graduate students and reviewing the work of others were extraordinary.”With a focus on health economics  Manning is known for his studies that tested how the structure of insurance and costs affected demand for medical care and health. He developed a robust model to estimate optimal health insurance coverage by considering the tradeoff between the costs from moral hazard and the gains from risk pooling in health insurance.In addition  his work involved rigorous examinations of statistical issues in modeling health and economic data  and the investigation of economic consequences of poor health habits  smoking  heavy drinking and lack of exercise. He was widely known for his work on the RAND Health Insurance Experiment  a randomized trial of alternative insurance plans conducted from 1974-1982.Dan Black  deputy dean and professor at Chicago Harris  said Manning’s work with the RAND study “transformed our understanding of health insurance and has been the gold standard against which research in health economics and health services are still measured today.”Black also commended Manning’s deep commitment to the teaching of statistics and the craft of research. “Will cared deeply that his research arrived at the correct conclusions  and he instilled this concern in his students ” said Black.Manning published over 150 articles and chapters in his career and co-authored five books  includingThe Costs of Poor Health Habitsby Harvard University Press in 1991. He received numerous awards for his papers on health economics  including the Victor Fuchs Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Health Economists in 2010  the Distinguished Investigator Award at the annual meeting of Academy Health in 2009 and the Kenneth Arrow Prize for the Best Health Economics Article in 2003.A member of the Institute of Medicine  Manning served on different committees addressing the lack of insurance and health care at the end of life. He was also on a National Academy of Science panel that examined adding measures of medical risk to new poverty measures.“Will’s scholarship made timeless contributions to our knowledge about how to analyze data on health spending and has allowed us to better understand critical health policy issues ” said David O. Meltzer  professor in the Department of Medicine  and affiliated faculty of Chicago Harris and the Department of Economics. “The methods he developed are essential tools for all health economists today.”Meltzer  who was Manning’s research and teaching colleague for many years  said Manning’s devotion to his students was legendary.“Will would provide amazingly detailed and thoughtful comments draft after draft of their written work and spend endless hours helping students solve their most difficult problems ” Meltzer added. “He set a standard for mentorship that is truly inspiring and is a model for all of us who have the honor of helping to train the next generation of scholars and teachers.”For years  Manning had been plagued with health problems  but his daughters Lisa Manning and Heather Carlson describe their father as “an incredibly resilient man who overcame the obstacles with determination and positivity until the very end.”As a father  Lisa said Manning taught his children and grandchildren to embrace the joy of learning and encouraged many endeavors that they had pursued in life. “My father was incredibly generous  which I always found very inspiring ” remembered Lisa. “He lit up at the prospect of seeing his grandchildren in a school recital or soccer game. The times I saw him playing Legos with them were the times he seemed to be at his happiest.”Manning is survived by his wife  Erika Manning; his daughters  Lisa Manning and Heather Carlson; his son-in-law  Brad Carlson; and his grandchildren  Emelia and Andrew Carlson.
                    Martin Riesebrodt  sociologist of religion  1948-2014            ,Update:The University memorial service in honor of Martin Riesebrodt will be held on Thursday  March 12  at 4 p.m. in Swift Hall. The service will include tributes from faculty colleagues and former students as well as musical selections. A reception will follow.As a scholar  Martin Riesebrodt brought a grounded and incisive approach to the sociology of religion. As a mentor  he pushed his graduate students to think deeply and find their own voices. As a colleague  he was always generous with his time and dry  witty insights.Riesebrodt  professor emeritus of the sociology of religion in the Divinity School and Department of Sociology  died Dec. 6 of cancer in Berlin. He was 66.“Martin Riesebrodt was a marvelous scholar and human being; his work on comparative fundamentalisms and on definitions of religion and their social mechanisms will stand the test of time for their cogency  sanity and critical bite ” said Margaret M. Mitchell  the Shailer Mathews Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature and dean of the Divinity School. “His death is a great loss to us at the University and to the academy.”Colleagues say Riesebrodt’s work offered an important counterpoint to religious studies scholarship that de-emphasized the value of comparing different traditions. Riesebrodt  by contrast  believed that looking across many religions and the behavior of their practitioners yielded deeper  more meaningful discoveries.InPious Passion: The Emergence of Modern Fundamentalism in the United States and Iran(University of California Press  1993; German original  1990)  which his colleague Bruce Lincoln calls “the best study of fundamentalism that’s ever been produced ” Riesebrodt argued that American Protestant and Iranian Shi’ite fundamentalism were motivated in part by a desire to reassert patriarchal structures of authority.Riesebrodt took on an even more ambitious project inThe Promise of Salvation: A Theory of Religion(University of Chicago Press  2010; German original  2007). By looking at why and how religion is practiced—and how religions talk about their own beliefs and the beliefs of other faiths—Riesebrodt sought to define and understand religion as a universal human concept.Riesebrodt was an internationally recognized expert on the work of the influential German sociologist Max Weber. He was an associate director of the Max Weber Archives and one of the editors of a German critical edition of Weber’s work Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe. Among his greatest contributions to his field was “the re-assertion of the relevance of the Weberian approach ” explained Andreas Glaeser  professor in sociology.“He re-introduced a generation of [American] scholars to Max Weber and the importance of the Weberian perspective for an understanding of religion ” agreed Lincoln  the Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School.A supportive mentorRiesebrodt’s views and social scientific approach sometimes set him apart from other thinkers in the field of religious studies. Yet colleagues say he exuded a quiet confidence in his own work—a confidence he instilled in the students whom he mentored.“He left a cadre of really beautifully trained  very intelligent and energetic students who are continuing the kind of work he tutored them in ” said Lincoln. “I don’t think I’ve seen anybody take better care of his advisees than Martin.”Loren Lybarger  PhD’02  now a senior fellow at the Martin Marty Center  experienced firsthand the gentle care and high expectations Riesebrodt had for his students. He could be tough-minded  but always in a constructive way  Lybarger recalls: “He was very interested in mentoring me so that I could become a rigorous thinker.”His mentorship extended beyond the academic—Riesebrodt and his wife Brigitte were always willing to open their homes to graduate students  inviting them to social events and reminding them that family life was as important as academic work.Riesebrodt continued to look out for his students well beyond their time at the University  even contacting colleagues at other institutions on their behalf as they searched for jobs.After he had finished his graduate work  Lybarger continued to seek Riesebrodt’s feedback on his works in progress. “He would invariably respond very thoughtfully ” says Lybarger  who helped toorganize a conference in 2011 at the Divinity School in Riesebrodt’s honor. “I trusted his intellectual support.”At the same time  Riesebrodt never tried to force his own ideas onto his graduate students. “What I admired most in his mentoring was the latitude he gave his students  his pushing us to find our own voices  to be the best scholars we could  in our own styles ” remembers Geneviève Zubrzycki  PhD’02  who is now an associate professor of sociology at the University of Michigan.“He insisted that the best way to get a job was not to mold ourselves to the market’s expectations  whatever the fad of the day might be  but to do what we love and do it brilliantly so that others would be convinced of the work’s importance.”Riesebrodt studied anthropology at the University of Heidelberg and sociology at the University of Munich. He taught in his native Germany until he joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1990. In his retirement  he returned to Europe and taught at theGraduate Institute in Genevawhere he held the Yves Oltramare Chair for Religion and Politics.Riesebrodt is survived by his wife  artist Brigitte Riesebrodt  and their son  Max  both of Berlin. A University memorial service will be planned for the Winter Quarter.
                    George Hillocks  Jr.  teacher of teachers  1934-2014            ,George Hillocks  Jr.  a teacher of teachers at the University of Chicago for more than 30 years  died in hospice on Nov. 12. He was 80. A memorial service for Hillocks will take place on Saturday  Dec. 6 at 2 p.m. in Bond Chapel.Hillocks  professor emeritus in English language and literature  taught in the University’s Department of Education and trained future English teachers in the Master of Arts in Teaching program from 1971 to 2002.His daughter Marjorie  also a teacher and a former faculty member at the Lab Schools  once had an office in Blaine Hall around the corner from her father’s. She remembers Hillocks as someone who “really did love his students…He could get very easily emotional when talking about his students ” she said. He also had passionate opinions about education—“and he wasn’t afraid to voice his opinions.”Throughout his career  Hillocks was a dedicated advocate for improving the teaching of writing in schools. His 1995 bookTeaching Writing as Reflective Practiceoutlined both theoretical and practical elements of improving writing instruction at the secondary and early undergraduate level. That book won theNational Council of Teachers of English’s David H. Russell Award for Distinguished Research in the Teaching of English.His last book Teaching Argument Writing  was used in classrooms across the country and was one of his most popular books among fellow teachers  according to his daughter.Hillocks also spoke out against the widespread use of standardized writing assessments; inThe Testing Trap  he argued that standardized tests actually hindered students’ writing and critical thinking abilities.His contributions to the field of education earned Hillocks the Distinguished Service Award from the National Council of Teachers of English in 2004. He also received the NCTE’s Richard Meade Award for his 2008 bookNarrative Writing: Learning a New Model for Teaching.Hillocks was born in Cleveland  Ohio in 1934. He received his BA from the College of Wooster  and his MA and PhD in English from Case Western Reserve University. He taught English at the secondary level from 1956 to 1961.The son of a Scottish immigrant  Hillocks was an accomplished bagpipe player who performed throughout the city and internationally. He was the Pipe Major for the Invermich Gaelic Society Pipe Band from 1984 to 1989. That band later became the University of Chicago Alumni Association Pipe Band  which performs at Convocation and other major University functions.He is survived by his children  Marjorie Hillocks and George “Mac” McInnes Hillocks; and three grandchildren  Geoffrey  Cameron and Dylan Hillocks. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the Wounded Warrior Project and the Midwest Palliative and Hospice Care Center.
