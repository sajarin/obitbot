Remembering biochemistry Professor Guido Guidotti,Guido Guidotti  Higgins Professor of Biochemistry  taught hundreds of students during more than 60 years of research and teaching. “The ultimate mentor and scientist ” Guidotti rarely took credit for his work and instead devoted himself to empowering his students in their own research.“He was modest and thoughtful and supportive and cheerful and enthusiastic and [he] didn’t take credit for things that he could easily have taken credit for. He didn’t care about the credit ” said his wife Nancy Kleckner  Herchel Smith Professor of Molecular Biology.Guidotti was born on Nov. 3  1933  in Florence  Italy. His early life was spent in Naples  where he proved to be a gifted student despite the effects of World War II.He completed three years of premedical training at Millikin University in Decatur  Illinois  in 1953. He received a medical degree from Washington University in 1957 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rockefeller University in 1963. Guidotti joined Harvard as an assistant professor of biology that year  and became a professor of biochemistry in 1969.Guidotti died April 5 in Newton  Massachusetts  following a long battle with prostate cancer. He was 87.During his 58 years at Harvard  Guidotti mentored dozens of young researchers who passed through his lab and was a beloved teacher to undergraduate students. In 2000  he received the Phi Beta Kappa Prize for Excellence in Teaching.Former students and colleagues remembered him as an inquisitive scientist  who encouraged students to think outside the box  and most of all  welcomed them as part of his family. Many recounted watching soccer in Guidotti’s laboratory and having invigorating discussions on science and politics.Rajeev Malhotra  an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital  met Guidotti as an undergraduate in 1998 when he took Guidotti’s biochemistry course. Malhotra later joined Guidotti’s lab and the two worked on the enzyme CD39  which acts on the cell surface to hydrolyze ATP  and studied how nucleotides such as ATP could cross the cell membrane from the intracellular space to the extracellular space.One of Guidotti’s most important findings was the discovery that CD39  which plays a central role in brain function  blood clotting  immunity  inflammation  and other basic physiological processes  was a divalent cation-stimulated ecto-ATPase. Guidotti and Malhotra’s work on CD39 would continue until Guidotti’s death.“In the few months before he passed away — sort of like coming full circle — this pathway that we had been working on when I was an undergraduate  CD39  now has been shown to be relevant in cardiovascular disease  specifically atherosclerosis  which is plaque formation on the blood vessel wall that can lead to heart attacks and stroke ” Malhotra said.“Infants who are born with defects in this pathway develop severe vascular disease. The plan was to work with Guido to develop a gene therapy to replace this enzyme as a therapeutic for this condition ” he continued. “Unfortunately  it won’t be the same without Guido to help guide the collaboration; but we are carrying on the project and his legacy  all based on his initial work  and that has special meaning for me.”Guidotti helped jump-start several careers  including that of John Pringle  professor of genetics at Stanford School of Medicine. Pringle  who was Guidotti’s second graduate student  worked on cell biology and yeast in Guidotti’s lab. He credited Guidotti’s caring guidance for his successful career in genetics research.“None of that would have been possible without Guido ” Pringle said. “I can’t even talk about it without starting to choke up because it was so important to me. As a difficult young man  as I look back on it  I realize that his patience and tolerance were what made it possible for me to survive  and ultimately prosper.”Vicki Sato  chairman of VIRbio and Denali and former professor of the practice in biochemistry  also met Guidotti as an undergrad. She audited several of his classes — even bringing her mother to one class — and had Guidotti serve on her Ph.D. thesis committee. Sato would return to Harvard as Guidotti’s colleague  but she said that did not affect their relationship.“Our relationship stayed much the same across this range of student to colleague  and I think it’s because he was  as a scientist  such an egalitarian person ” she said.For Guidotti  everyone in his lab was an equal  Sato said  “It didn’t matter what your rank was in the lab. It didn’t matter want your title was  he viewed you as an individual and as a scientist and as a colleague.”Along with his wife  Guidotti is survived by a son and daughter-in-law  a grandson  and a brother.
A pioneering geneticist and Renaissance man of parts,A large wooden conference table stood beneath an enormous  mounted moose head in the center of the lab of renowned geneticist Richard “Dick” C. Lewontin. Many considered it nearly the beating heart of the lab  which took up the entire third floor of Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Here students  postdocs  and visiting scientists gathered to dissect and debate an eclectic set of topics  from population genetics and ethics to politics and history.“The table was the center of action. This was where the arguments were had ” said Andrew Berry  a Harvard lecturer in evolutionary biology. “His lab was the single most intellectually vibrant place in the universe because it was set up for interaction  drawing in all sorts of really smart  interesting people  often with different perspectives. It implicitly created an amazing sense of community.”According to colleagues  friends  and former students of Lewontin  who died on July 4 in Cambridge at 92  this was the kind of environment in which the population geneticist and Renaissance man thrived. The space he created was not unlike himself  whip-smart  curious  and tough-minded yet warm and welcoming  capable of dealing out penetrating critiques during debates  but so engaging and magnetic that people  especially those passionate about all things science  gravitated toward him.“It was a bit of a paradox: He was intimidating and brilliant and incisive  but he was also incredibly charismatic and loyal to his people ” said Berry  who served as a postdoctoral researcher in Lewontin’s lab in the 1990s. “He was truly a fantastic mentor  and he really went to bat for his people in a very Lewontin kind of way.”A prime example was Lewontin’s refusal to put his name on scientific papers coming out of his lab if he contributed ideas but did none of the work  colleagues said. He also gave a nice corner office with large windows to the individual responsible for what was considered the least glamorous job in the lab — refreshing the food for the thousands of fruit fly larvae.“It’s a big  dirty  messy  smelly job ” Berry recalled. “Lewontin said: ‘This is the worst job in the lab  so the person doing that should have the best space in the lab.’”
The evolution of bigotry,James H. Sidanius devoted much of his career to the pursuit of one question: Why are societies always hierarchical  with some groups at the top and others at the bottom?The John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in memory of William James and of African and African American Studies  who died June 29 at age 75  knew from a young age how inequality and oppression functioned in his own society. He got involved in Civil Rights  Black liberation  and anti-war activism as a teenager in New York City  and saw that legislative efforts to win rights for Black people did not erase their marginal status in everyday life.At the same time  Sidanius was nurturing a burgeoning interest in psychology. He received a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the City College at the City University of New York and did counseling work with local youth. But he became disillusioned with both clinical work and the deep-seated racism of his home country in the late 1960s and  like many other Black activists of the time  sought a new home abroad. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and traveled to Cuba and Algeria before settling in Sweden  where he earned a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Stockholm. While there  he saw hierarchies of ethnicity and gender play out in a different  yet familiar way.These life experiences were foundational to Sidanius’ pioneering theory of social dominance  honed over decades of research. His central thesis  developed in the early 1990s with Felicia Pratto  a professor of psychological sciences at the University of Connecticut  was that human societies are structured along hierarchies of three types: age  gender  and arbitrary markers of race  ethnic group  class  or other association that can change over time and under particular economic or demographic conditions.“From his vantage point  intergroup relations  especially systems of stable racial and ethnic hierarchy and inequality  are very common developments in human experience and  he would say  human evolution ” said Lawrence D. Bobo  dean of social sciences and W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences. “In effect  he said the creation of ethno-racial hierarchy had been selected for through evolutionary time as a survival mechanism for the human species  and that those systems of ethno-racial inequality involve a dominant or privileged group at the top and one clear negative reference or minority group at the bottom. While this evolutionary view didn’t make any particular system of inequality just or moral  the pattern was altogether too common and too time-insensitive  in his view  to be otherwise.”Sidanius and Pratto also originated the idea of social dominance orientation: the extent to which an individual will support or work against hierarchy in a social system. That orientation  they argued  could influence a person’s interests  choice of career  and religious and racial attitudes. And on the whole  they felt it was unlikely that a given society would ever fully eradicate hierarchy in favor of egalitarianism.“He thought that individuals will vary in the extent to which they kind of support or work against hierarchy in social systems — some people had a strong proclivity toward being hierarchy enhancers  and others had a strong proclivity toward being hierarchy attenuators ” said Bobo. “I think his theory is of a general import that is likely to stand the test of time.”Sidanius was born James Brown in 1945 and grew up in New York City. He changed his last name upon moving to Sweden  but returned to the U.S. in the 1980s as a permanent resident. After 17 years on the faculty at University of California  Los Angeles  he moved to Harvard in 2006 and established the Sidanius Lab to study the social psychology of unequal intergroup relations  including power relations and hierarchies  prejudice  and identity-based conflict.Prior to Sidanius’ work  social dominance was “a problem that no psychologist had recognized to be the fundamental aspect of social life that his work singularly demonstrated ” said Mahzarin Banaji  Richard Clarke Cabot Professor of Social Ethics. “He created that subfield  gathered a brilliant group of students to invest in understanding it  and left no stone unturned to understand all its complexities.”Sidanius’ work ethic was well-known among his colleagues and students. Bobo recalled that at UCLA Sidanius was nicknamed “The Brain ” and he emerged from his office only for caffeine and meals.At Harvard  “The light in his William James Hall office was always on  evenings and weekends ” said Banaji. “He exemplified for me the word ‘pursuit’ in the phrase ‘the pursuit of knowledge.’”As part of that pursuit  Sidanius was not afraid to shy away from debate. He was one of the few people to talk openly about the role of evolutionary theory in psychology at a time when such work was more controversial.He also faced pushback from other scholars for his theory of gender prejudice  “which held that systems of ethno-racial inequality are fundamentally struggles among and between men  not women ” said Bobo. “Some people  especially feminists  took him to task on that  and I think it had a healthy effect on how he articulated the theory from then on.”Sa-kiera T.J. Hudson  a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and former graduate student at Harvard  recalled arguing with Sidanius “like old ninnies” about the finer points of his theory  particularly around gender.Despite their disagreements  “Jim treated me like an intellectual equal  to the point someone remarked they wished they could be a fly on the wall during some of our debates ” said Hudson  who received a Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard in 2020. “I learned how to think theoretically from our debates around his theory of gender prejudice  and I think over time he knew I was onto something good because he wouldn’t debate me anymore.”Over the course of his career  Sidanius published five books and more than 330 scientific papers. He received numerous honors for his work  including a Harold Lasswell Award from the International Society of Political Psychology for Distinguished Scientific Contribution in the Field of Political Psychology and a Career Contribution Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. He also received a Scientific Impact Award and a Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. Sidanius was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007 and the Association of Psychological Science in 2013.Sidanius employed numerous research methods in his work but was especially interested in data analysis. He taught research methods at Harvard  and in his final years  he was teaching himself the complex R programming language  used by many data analysts  to stay current with statistics research.“He had a very high level of statistical analytical skills and was constantly collecting and analyzing data ” said Bobo. “He relentlessly pursued ways of getting data to test and validate his viewpoint  as opposed to simply accepting a claim that someone else had put on the table.”“When I felt disheartened because of the nature of my research on prejudice and inequality  he reminded me that it was just the nature of the game  saying  ‘You can’t get mad at the rattlesnake for biting you; it’s just in its nature ’” said Asma Ghani  a current doctoral student in the Sidanius Lab. “When I felt scared of my research — fearing failed experiments — he reminded me that there was no need to feel scared of data  to just let it speak to me and that I was a good scientist regardless of the outcome of my experiments.”Sidanius employed his data-based methods in his personal life  notably on a meticulously maintained spreadsheet of his favorite high-performance cars and their attributes. He also had eclectic taste in music  exacting standards for stereo systems and vinyl records  an interest in photography  and a love of Death Valley in California. Sidanius lived in Cambridge and is survived by his wife  Miriam  a son from a previous marriage  a daughter-in-law  and one grandchild.“He was a big persona  a charming and very solid man  a good friend. If you got to talk to him  you would find it difficult to forget him ” said Bobo. “He was willing to look at the ugly side of human social existence  and in many ways would focus on what comes out of the dark side of human nature — or the beast  as he would call it. He felt that if you can’t look at it or engage it  then you can’t deal with it.”
An instrumental scientist,Jerome Kagan  the Daniel and Amy Starch Research Professor of PsychologyEmeritusand a pathbreaking scholar of developmental psychology  never let a good idea pass him by — no matter where he was when it occurred.“He’d be driving down Memorial Drive and have a great idea he wanted to tell you  so he’d slow down  turn to look at you  and start talking — in the middle of the road ” recalled Kagan’s friend and colleagueCharles A. Nelson III  professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of research at Boston Children’s Hospital’s Developmental Medicine Center.Kagan  whose relentless curiosity and formidable intelligence were as notable as his driving habits  died May 10 in Chapel Hill  North Carolina. He was 92 years old.During his storied  six-decade career in developmental child psychology — 36 of them spent teaching at Harvard —Kagan unraveled previously held ideas and introduced new theories about how children’s behavior and traits develop from infancy through adolescence.“He was a towering intellect ” said Nelson. “The field of developmental psychology  and psychology more broadly  has lost a very important figure.”Kagan used longitudinal studies that followed his subjects from infancy through adolescence to focus on the origins of temperament in children. In contrast to earlier claims that children’s traits were influenced solely by parenting and social environment  he found that about 15 percent of babies were very shy as infants — his category was “behaviorally inhibited” — and they largely retained this trait across childhood.However  he also found that some children’s behavior changed as they grew up depending on parental involvement  which indicated a connection between a child’s psychology and biology.“His work recognized that the roots of anxiety in some children may begin in infancy ” said Nelson. “If parents recognized that they had a child who was behaviorally inhibited and did all the right things [to help him or her become more comfortable in novel situations]  the child could blossom and grow. But if not  the child could become profoundly anxious.”“As a scientist  [Kagan] was instrumental in emphasizing the reality of temperament  particularly shyness versus social boldness  and establishing that temperament emerged early and persisted through the lifespan ” saidSteven Pinker  the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology  who took courses with Kagan as a Harvard graduate student in the 1970s.“His findings challenged the common view in developmental psychology that children are interchangeable blank slates  shaped by parenting and other features of their environment ” said Pinker. “He emphasized the interaction between inborn temperament and maturational timetables and the child’s experience with parents  peers  schooling  and adults.”Kagan was born in Newark  New Jersey  and grew up in nearby Rahway. He earned his bachelor’s degree in biology and psychology from Rutgers University  doctorate in psychology from Yale  and honorary master’s degree from Harvard. He taught at Ohio State University  served as a psychologist in medical research at the U.S. Army Hospital at West Point  New York  and worked on the staff of the Fels Institute in Yellow Springs  Ohio  before joining the Harvard faculty in 1964 as a professor of psychology.Two years before coming to Harvard  Kagan and Howard A. Moss published a landmark book  “Birth to Maturity: A Study in Psychological Development.” The work analyzed a longitudinal study that emphasized a connection between experiences in early life and the development of certain characteristics in adulthood. Other early work included similar long-term studies in rural Guatemala and in Cambridge.A prolific writer  Kagan published dozens of articles  reports  and books  including “Understanding Children: Behavior  Motives  and Thought” (1971)  “The Nature of the Child” (1984)  and “What Is Emotion? History  Measures  and Meanings” (2007). His most recent book  “A Trio of Pursuits: Puzzles in Human Development ” was published in January 2021.“During the 1940s and ’50s  many citizens and social scientists believed that the main  if not the only  cause of the problems that plague our species were childhood experiences ” Kagan told theHarvard Gazettein 2010. “This belief was an heir of Freudian ideas and the confidence of behaviorists  who were demonstrating the power of experience to shape animal behavior. It followed that anyone who discovered the specific experiences that led to a mental illness  crime  or school failure would be a hero doing God’s work. Who would not entertain the idea of becoming a child psychologist  given this zeitgeist?”Martha Minow the 300th Anniversary University Professor at Harvard Law School  admired Kagan’s ability to explore new ways of thinking and use new forms of technology in the face of changes in his field.“At one time  I was worried that the study of human beings was being replaced by the study of brain cells. [Kagan] said that knowledge grows in all kinds of ways and we have to explore the new technologies and new methods without holding onto the old ones simply because we don’t like disruption ” she said. “He recognized that we learn in part by disrupting what we knew in the past  and that can be dislodging to our stability and sense of what we understand  but that’s how we grow. For me  it’s such a lesson in boldness and humility.”Friends  colleagues  and former students spoke of his mentorship and commitment to improving the work of others — often with no holds barred. Nelson recalled that Kagan liked to start most conversations with the same anxiety-producing question: “What have you discovered this week?”“He expected his interlocutors to be just as engaged  generous  and reflective as he was  and when someone views you in that light  you want to live up to it ” saidMoira Dillon  an assistant professor of psychology at New York University who worked with Kagan on his 2013 book “The Human Spark: The Science of Human Development” when she was a Harvard doctoral student. “While Jerry’s critiques were always numerous  he also gave praise generously  and indeed his praise of me as a young scientist was affirming and encouraging. His style and balance of critique and praise were genuine; he fostered a sense of not only equality  but also mutual respect.”Minow called her experience working with Kagan “a true highlight of my 40 years at Harvard.” The two co-created and co-taught (with Robert A. LeVine  professor of educationemeritus) “Children and Their Social Worlds ” a popular undergraduate course in the 1990s. Students in the class often wrote to Kagan about how the course changed their career plans and steered them into pediatrics or child advocacy. The teaching collaboration also coincided with the birth of Minow’s daughter  which was a “fabulous” development.“I had my own personal child psychologist on call ” she said. “Especially when I as a new parent was asking a lot of questions  he had so much patience and interest and curiosity.”Kagan received numerous honors  including the Hofheimer Prize from the American Psychiatric Association and the G. Stanley Hall Award and Distinguished Scientific Award from the American Psychological Association. He served on numerous committees of the National Academy of Sciences  the President’s Science Advisory Committee  the Social Science Research Council  the National Institute of Mental Health  and the National Research Council.He was an avid tennis player  a voracious reader  and a fixture at the Harvard Faculty Club.He is survived by his daughter  Janet Kagan; granddaughter  Leah Kagan-Reznick Tyner  and her husband  Jon Tyner; and great-grandson James Emerson Tyner. His wife of nearly 70 years  Cele  died in 2020.A celebration of his life will be held at a later date.
Kennedy School mourns the passing of Gustave ‘Gus’ Hauser,Gustave M. Hauser — who with his wife  Rita  established the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations in 1997  endowed two faculty positions  supported extended visits by prominent public leaders  and funded the recent renovation of the Center for Public Leadership — died Feb. 14 after a long illness.Hauser will be remembered across Harvard for his steadfast support and enduring generosity. At Harvard Kennedy School  the Hausers focused especially on the nexus of public policy and civil society. The Hauser Center became part of the Center for Public Leadership in 2013  when it was renamed the Hauser Institute for Civil Society. A signature project  theHauser Leaders Program  is now in its seventh year of bringing distinguished leaders from the public  nonprofit  and private sectors to Harvard to learn from and enrich the University community. The Hausers also funded the Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations  a position held today by Cornell William Brooks  and the Rita E. Hauser Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Civil Society  a position now held by Marshall Ganz. Most recently  the Hausers enabled a renovation of the space occupied by the Center for Public Leadership.“Gus Hauser was a remarkable person who cared deeply about creating positive change in the world. His interest in developing ethical leaders who can work across sectors to make a difference has had a significant impact both at Harvard and beyond ” said Douglas Elmendorf  dean of HKS.Harvard President Larry Bacow said  “I was privileged to serve as a Hauser leader-in-residence at the Center for Public Leadership in 2015  where I saw firsthand the good that continues to derive from the Hausers’ generosity. Gus cared about making an impact  and his and Rita’s thoughtful philanthropy made Harvard — and the world — a better place.”Hauser was a pioneer of the cable television communications industry  serving as the founding chairman and CEO of Warner Cable Communications and later as chairman and CEO of Hauser Communications Inc. He led many industry innovations  including pay-per-view and interactive services  and launched many well-known channels.Among his public service activities  Hauser was twice appointed by the U.S. president to serve as director-at-large of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation  of which he was a founder.Gus and Rita Hauser founded The Hauser Foundation Inc. in 1990. In addition to their extensive support of Harvard Kennedy School  they were the crucial donors for Hauser Hall at Harvard Law School and for the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching. They also served as honorary chairs of the most recent Campaign for Harvard University.Gus Hauser received his A.B. from Western Reserve University  his J.D. from Harvard Law School  his LL.M. from New York University Law School  and an LL.M from the University of Paris Law Faculty. The Hausers met at Harvard Law School and were together for 64 years.
Harvard economist Robert Glauber dies at 81,Robert R. Glauber  a Harvard economist who straddled the worlds of academia and public service  has died at age 81.In 1987  Glauber served as executive director of what became known as the Brady Commission  the task force appointed by President Ronald Reagan to report on the October 1987 stock market crash. Nicholas Brady  the Wall Street securities executive who chaired the panel  later became Treasury Secretary in the George H.W. Bush administration and invited Glauber to join his team as undersecretary for finance. There Glauber led negotiations in resolving the savings and loan crisis and also proposed an ambitious  though ultimately unsuccessful  reform of Depression-era restrictions on bank activities in the financial sector.He subsequently served as chief executive officer of the private-sector regulator of U.S. securities markets (then known as the National Association of Securities Dealers and now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority).Before his public service  Glauber  a New Yorker and 1961 graduate of Harvard College  had been a professor of finance at Harvard Business School for more than two decades  joining the faculty after receiving his doctorate there in 1965. He returned to Harvard in the 1990s  sharing his deep experience in financial regulation with students as a member of the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) faculty. He also served as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School.Friends and colleagues remembered him for his collegiality and his devotion to those he was mentoring.“As a teacher  Bob was known for his ability to help his students think more clearly and for his devotion to them ” said Doug Elmendorf  dean of HKS and Don K. Price Professor of Public Policy. “He was always willing to spend time with students and to encourage them in their lives.”IBM Professor of Business and Government Roger Porter  who worked with Glauber in the Bush administration  said: “Sometimes those in departments seek to control rather than to consult … to be in charge and to be seen as in charge. Bob chose the path of consultation and cooperation rather than confrontation and contention. He shared and disclosed rather than hid and obfuscated. It was a joy to work with him.”One of his last projects  which knit together his academic training and values  was the non-profit American Exchange Project  a high school exchange program that allowed students from all walks of life to understand one another  make friends  and ultimately host each other for several weeks.Glauber passed peacefully at his home on Feb. 14. He is survived by his wife  Barbara  and children Alexander and Amelia and their families.The Daily GazetteSign up for daily emails to get the latest Harvard news.
In memoriam: Bernard Lown,Bernard Lown  a belovedemeritusfaculty member and mentor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health  died on Feb. 16 at his home in Chestnut Hill  Mass. He was 99.Lown’s was a life devoted to the health and well-being of people around the world  from his innovative work in the field of cardiology to his tireless advocacy against the catastrophic threat of nuclear war. He retired from Harvard Chan School in 2000 as a professor of cardiologyemeritus  but remained a vital part of the life of the School through the training program established in his name.Lown had a sense of moral urgency to remedy the world’s wrongs since he left Lithuania at age 14 with his Jewish family to avoid Nazi persecution. It informed his work as a cardiologist  which focused on preventing sudden cardiac death  one of the most common causes of death in the United States. He pushed the field forward technically — notably by revolutionizing care of patients with heart attack through development of coronary care units  and by developing the direct-current defibrillator and heart-monitored exercise testing — while also exploring the root causes of disease and becoming involved in activism for peace.Lown earned a bachelor’s degree in zoology from the University of Maine in 1942 and his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1945.After his medical training  Lown became a physician and researcher at the former Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He joined Harvard Chan School’sDepartment of Nutritionin the 1950s  adding his expertise at a time when it was shifting its focus from the health needs of a population under wartime rationing to the role of nutrition in the so-called “diseases of civilization ” including heart disease.In 1961  as Cold War tensions mounted with the Soviet Union  Lown co-founded Physicians for Social Responsibility to organize U.S. physicians against the threat of nuclear war. He co-founded International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) in 1980  and accepted a Nobel Prize on behalf of the group with Soviet cardiologist Yevgeny Chazov five years later.Lown’s development of the direct-current defibrillator  also known as the cardioverter  in 1962 has saved countless lives worldwide. But he also took great pride in establishing moments of human connection with his patients  first at the Brigham  and later at his clinic  the Lown Cardiovascular Center. He eloquently shared his insights in his book  “The Lost Art of Healing ” and with the many young physicians whom he mentored.In 2008  theBernard Lown Scholars in Cardiovascular Health Programwas established at Harvard Chan School to train scientists and public health professionals from Africa  Asia  and Latin America. For many of the Scholars  the opportunity to meet with Lown was a highlight of their time in the program.“He was a keen observer and interpreter of human behavior  and had an exceptional ability to uncover the underlying causes of ill health ” saidGoodarz Danaei  Bernard Lown Associate Professor of Cardiovascular Health and director of the Lown Scholars program. “Many Scholars shared amazing stories of how he encouraged them to look at public health problems with the same depth and acuity.”He added  “I hope that we  in the program and in the wider Harvard Chan community  continue walking in his footsteps and ensure that his legacy of respect for human life  passion for serving the underserved  and speaking truth to power remains lively and strong. We are all grateful to him for teaching us how to listen carefully  think deeply  organize effectively  and persevere in the tortuous path to serve those in need.”Joseph Brain  Cecil K. and Philip Drinker Professor of Environmental Physiology  began a friendship with Lown in the 1960s when his laboratory and medical clinic were at Harvard Chan School. He noted that Lown did not believe that his work on the cardioverter and IPPNW were his most important contributions in cardiology and physician activism.“As a cardiologist at the Brigham  against the advice of his seniors  he showed that prolonged bed rest was a bad policy after a heart attack ” Brain said. “Get out of bed. Sit in a chair. Take a few steps. As a physician activist he not only anticipated the internet with a satellite to communicate globally  he persuaded the USSR to repurpose a ballistic missile and to launch his device — SatelLife [which provided remote medical training and information to thousands of doctors and health care workers in Africa and Asia]. At our School  the Lown Scholars Program and the Lown Archives will celebrate his life and create paths to pursue the changes for which he has always fought. An extraordinary human being has left us. We miss him.”Lown and his wife Louise were married for 73 years; she died in 2019. Lown is survived by three children  Anne  Fredric  and Naomi; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.Read more about Lown’s life and legacy in hisNew York Times obituary.
Richard Cooper  cutting-edge economist  dies at 86,Most economists live in the world of theory  using careful calculations to predict the future. But Richard N. Cooper believed theory couldn’t tell the whole story when it came to solving real-world problems  particularly when they involve the whole world — which he amply demonstrated after a global recession in the 1970s.The Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics “understood that human systems are complex ” saidKenneth Rogoff  professor of economics and Thomas D. Cabot Professor of Public Policy  a colleague of Cooper in Harvard’s economics department. “He wanted to bring realism  institutional understanding  and historical experience to economics  not just mathematical technique.”Cooper  who died Dec. 23 at age 86 from cancer  left his mark on the world of economics from his position at Harvard  where he taught for almost 40 years  and from the White House  where he worked under four different presidents as an adviser and policy expert.As a researcher  Cooper was a trailblazer. Six years after receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard in economics in 1962  he published his landmark book  “The Economics of Interdependence: Economic Policy in the Atlantic Community.”In the book and in associated research on the subject  Cooper argued that “countries could achieve better outcomes if they committed to joint settings of macroeconomic policy ” wroteJeffrey Frankel  James W. Harpel Professor of Capital Formation and Growth at the Harvard Kennedy School  in ablog postremembering his friend.The argument  widely accepted today in economics  was a departure from established ideas popularized by John Nash’s non-cooperative equilibrium theory  which dictated each country should go it alone on economic policy and implementation. Cooper saw an alternative  in which countries could work in tandem to reduce inefficiencies and promote prosperity in a collaborative and coordinated way.“He was always asking the right question  and always interested in taking the discussion of any piece of work right to the question of why it mattered for economic policy  and what should be done as a result ” addedBenjamin Friedman  William Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy.For the next 60 years  Cooper remained engaged with the world of monetary policy and traditional economic theory and implored his colleagues and students to ask themselves whether the work they were doing would be relevant outside the ivory tower.In economics  “It’s very tempting to make assumptions so that you can proceed with your analysis  but [Cooper] would always give us a hard time when he thought [our] assumptions weren’t reasonable ” said Rogoff. “He was somebody whose feedback you wanted because it might help you shape your work in a more useful way” when it came to practical applications.Born in Seattle  Cooper received a bachelor’s degree at Oberlin College and a master’s degree at the London School of Economics as a Marshall Scholar. After receiving his Ph.D.  he taught economics at Yale and was provost there from 1972-74.“He was not interested in his own fame. [He] was interested in understanding the world and making the world better.”— Pol Antràs  Robert G. Ory Professor of EconomicsIn 1981  he joined the Harvard faculty  where he influenced generations of economists to expand their understanding of their field and recognize the value of real-world experiences in shaping policy and theory. He was a strong presence in seminars  workshops  and lectures  where he could be counted on to share knowledge and opinions.“He asked tough questions  was an incredibly knowledgeable person  and was very vocal about things he didn’t like or didn’t think were important ” saidPol Antràs  Robert G. Ory Professor of Economics. “But he was always very kind and interested in my work. Even though I knew that it wasn’t the type of research he would be doing  I felt like he respected it. That was very uplifting for me.”During his tenure as a professor  Cooper also held numerous senior positions in the federal government. His first was as a senior staff economist on President John F. Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisers — a job he reportedly rode his bicycle to every day. He also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Monetary Affairs under President Lyndon B. Johnson  Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs under President Jimmy Carter  and chair of the National Intelligence Council as part of the Clinton administration.In the 1970s  Cooper developed the “locomotive theory” of international fiscal coordination  in which three nations (Japan  Germany  and the U.S.) would “pull” the global economy to safety following a recession in the mid-1970s. The idea was put to the test at the 1978 Bonn Summit of G-7 Leaders attended by Carter  who had appointed Cooper to the State Department post the year before. At the gathering  the nations agreed on a joint statement of commitments regarding economic policy — the first successful agreement of its kind and a model for future such accords.The establishment and continuation of the G-7  and later G-8 and G-20 meetings of world leaders to focus on joint economic policy  years after Cooper’s work  are examples of his influence both as a researcher and policy expert  said Frankel.Cooper was also the chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 1990-1992  and was a member of the Trilateral Commission  the Council on Foreign Relations  the executive panel of the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations  and the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity. His many publications include the volumes “Environment and Resource Policies for the Integrated World Economy ” “Boom  Crisis  and Adjustment: The Macroeconomic Experience of Developing Countries ” and “What the Future Holds: Insights from Social Science.”Cooper’s career showed that “you can do research and be engaged in policy as an economist  and find the combination fruitful and productive ” said Antràs. “He was not interested in his own fame. [He] was interested in understanding the world and making the world better.”Cooper  who Frankel said was always “young for his age ” was also an avid home repairer and world traveler  and he enjoyed exploring the bicycle paths around Cambridge  which he rode until last year with his family and friends.“He had boundless intellectual curiosity and energy [and] looked on the bright side of things ” Frankel wrote in his remembrance. “I learned something from him every time we talked.”A memorial is planned for a future date.
Ezra Vogel  leading expert on East Asia  dead at 90,Ezra F. Vogel  Henry Ford II Professor of the Social SciencesEmeritus died Dec. 20 at Mount Auburn Hospital due to complications from surgery. He was 90.A remarkable contributor to the study of East Asia  Vogel’s breadth of research covered the entirety of the region  and he brought not only a deep knowledge and understanding of each country  but also of the political  economic  and cultural interconnectedness. He served as the second director of the East Asian Research Center (now the Fairbank Center) from 1973 to 1975 and again from 1995 to 1999.“It is hard to exaggerate the role played by Ezra in this important chapter of Harvard’s growth. As a leader of various academic centers  he shaped the direction of Harvard research on East Asia and ensured it was firmly grounded in real-world affairs; his own work as a scholar shared this same practical quality  as did his many contributions as a public intellectual and his generous mentorship of generations of students and scholars ” said Mark Elliott  vice provost for international affairs and Mark Schwartz Professor of Chinese and Inner Asian History. “One might well think of him a ‘mover and a shaker ’ but I expect Ezra himself would most want to be remembered as a builder: of ties between people across Harvard and between Harvard and other universities  of connections between the University and the public sector  and of bridges between peoples.”A son of Jewish immigrants who grew up in the small town of Delaware  Ohio  Vogel graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1950 and received his Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard in 1958. After two years conducting fieldwork in Japan  he joined Yale as an assistant professor in 1960  but returned to Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow in 1961  studying Chinese language and history. He became a professor in 1967.Vogel visited East Asia every year after 1958 and spent more than six years in the region. In 1987  he spent eight months in China  studying the economic and social progress of Guangdong  a province that had led the country’s efforts to pioneering economic reform after 1978. Vogel returned from his most recent trip to China last January  just as word was first coming out about the COVID-19 pandemic.“For so many people he was not only a gracious  friendly person  but a model for what a scholar should be.”— Michael Szonyi  director of the Fairbank CenterHis work contributed extensively to building institutions that would support generations of scholars and practitioners with an interest in East Asia. Beyond the Fairbank Center  he served as the second chairman of Harvard’sCouncil for East Asian Studies(1977-1980) and director of theUndergraduate Concentration in East Asian Studiesfrom its inception in 1972 until 1989. In 1980  he served as the founding director of theHarvard Program on U.S.-Japan Relationsat the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs  where he served until 1987  and then as honorary director until his passing.In 1993 he took a two-year leave of absence from Harvard to serve as a national intelligence officer for East Asia at the National Intelligence Council during the Clinton administration. Upon his return to Harvard  he served at the Fairbank Center and then as the founding director (1997-99) of theHarvard University Asia Center  a space he envisioned as supporting transnational and transregional studies of the Asian continent.“For so many people he was not only a gracious  friendly person  but a model for what a scholar should be ” Fairbank Center Director Michael Szonyi said. “At a time when scholarship was moving increasingly in a direction of narrow  disciplinary specialization he tried to bring together political scientists  sociologists  historians  even medical anthropologists  and to get us in conversation with each other.”RelatedVogel wins Gelber Prize for bookScholar's book on China 'deepens public debate on significant international issues'His many books reflect these multifaceted intellectual endeavors and include: “Japan’s New Middle Class ” “Canton Under Communism ” “Japan as Number One: Lessons for America ” “Comeback  Case by Case: Building the Resurgence of American Business ” “One Step Ahead in China: Guangdong Under Reform ” “The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia ” “Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China ” and most recently  “China and Japan: Facing History.” The Japanese edition of“Japan as Number One: Lessons for America” (1979) remains the all-time best-seller in Japan of nonfiction by a Western author.Ever the optimist  Vogel was an advocate for improving mutual understanding between the U.S. and China. Colleagues and friends remembered him for his kindness  generosity  patience  and devotion to teaching. He always described himself as a student first and a teacher second  and his son Steven  writing inThe Japan Times  said that he “will be most remembered for his boundless good cheer and boyish enthusiasm.”Vogel is survived by his wife of 41 years  Charlotte Ikels; son David Vogel of Cambridge  Mass.; son Steven Vogel of Berkeley  Calif.; daughter Eve Vogel of Amherst  Mass.; sister Fay Bussgang of Dedham  Mass.; and five grandchildren.A memorial service will held at an appropriate time in the new year.
Goodbye to ‘Mr. Cambridge’,Shortly after Maria Dominguez Gray took the helm at the Phillips Brooks House Association  the organization for undergraduate volunteer opportunities at Harvard  two students came up with the idea of launching an overnight shelter for homeless youth.Dominguez Gray  who had been a deputy director for thePhillips Brooks House Association(PBHA) for 12 years  wanted to support the students  but finding a location was proving difficult. Like other times when she needed advice  she turned to Frank Duehay ’55  who was on the PBHA’s board of trustees and had become a cherished mentor.Known as “Mr. Cambridge” for having served on the Cambridge City Council for nearly 36 years  including three terms as mayor  Duehay threw all his support behind Dominguez Gray and the project. In December 2015 Y2Y Harvard Square  a student-run overnight shelter  opened in the basement of the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge.“Frank was the true embodiment of service and love ” said Dominguez Gray  PBHA Class of 1955 Executive Director. “He was so dedicated to his hometown of Cambridge and the student leaders  and he truly believed in PBHA’s mission of students and community members partnering to meet the most pressing needs in Greater Boston and make this world a better place.”Duehay  87  died Nov. 20 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of acute leukemia  but his legacy will be remembered at Harvard and beyond. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in English  he later earned a master’s degree in teaching the subject and a doctorate in education from the Graduate School of Education. Teaching and public service were his passions.At Harvard  Duehay served as both acting director of admissions and assistant dean in the Graduate School of Education. He received the Harvard Alumni Association Award in 2006.
Guido Goldman dies at age 83,Guido Goldman’s began his service to Harvard by pulling in one of the biggest political names of his time. As a graduate student  the Zurich-born Goldman worked with Henry Kissinger ’50  A.M. ’51  Ph.D. ’54  to establish the German Research Center. From then until 1994  Goldman and Professor Stanley Hoffman helmed the center as its founding director  steering it as it became the Program on Western Studies  the Center for European Studies (CES)  and finally the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies — this at the same time he taught as a senior lecturer in government and  later  the center’s director of the Program for the Study of Germany.Goldman died Nov. 30 at age 83. He left behind an indelible mark on Harvard and the field of European studies  having forged enduring partnerships between Germany and the U.S. that continue to foster trans-Atlantic interchange and understanding.A man with a brilliant mind  modest manner  and great conviviality  Goldman was born on Nov. 4  1937  the son of a German mother  Alice Gottschalk  and Nahum Goldmann  co-founder of the World Jewish Congress and president of the World Zionist Organization. The family fled to the U.S. in 1940. Goldman entered Harvard College and joined Winthrop House  graduatingsumma cum laudein 1959 and earning a doctorate in government in 1969 with a prize-winning dissertation on “Heavy Industry and Foreign Policy in the Weimar Republic.”Goldman’s contributions to public life in the United States were prodigious. As a young man  he was the primary force behind establishing the German Marshall Fund (GMF)  an institution dedicated to improving trans-Atlantic understanding. It was Goldman’s initiative that led German Chancellor Willy Brandt to announce a major foundational gift to the GMF and a significant endowment for CES at Harvard’s Commencement on June 5  1972  the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan. Guido served the GMF for 40 years as the founding chair of its board  a period during which he was also an important contributor to German-American relations and a board member of the American Council on Germany  the Council on Foreign Relations  and the Atlantic Council of the United States. In 1978  he was awarded the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit by the Federal Republic of Germany for his “contributions towards fostering German-American relations.”Goldman also made many contributions to Harvard. Over four decades he helped raise more than $75 million for the University  including multiple endowments for European studies. In 1967  he helped establish the prestigious John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellowships and served as the program’s first director. In 1974  he secured a major gift from the Krupp Foundation for an endowed professorship in European studies  the first at Harvard to incorporate funding for graduate fellowships. In 1986  when Harvard was reconsidering usage of Adolphus Busch Hall  Goldman stewarded a generous donation from the de Gunzburg family to renovate the building as the new home for CES and establish an endowment for it. In 1990  Goldman helped negotiate an agreement through which the German government established three Centers of Excellence for German and European Studies at Harvard University  Georgetown University  and University of California  Berkeley. He was also instrumental in raising funds for the McCloy Program at Harvard Kennedy School and for the construction of Otto Werner Hall  an addition to the Fogg Museum that housed Harvard’s collection of expressionist art.In May 2018  Harvard awarded Goldman the Centennial Medal  the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ highest honor  for his “lifelong commitment to promoting international peace and prosperity” and “decades of impeccable leadership of the Center for European Studies and service” to his alma mater.Goldman was also a major supporter of the arts  serving for many years on the board and as vice chair of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater  and helping organize the Dance2Bfit program to fight obesity in primary schools. As the founder of the American Foundation for Textile Art  he assembled and curated the world’s finest collection of Central Asian Ikat art  for which he was elected to the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan in 1998.  After sponsoring many exhibitions of these textiles in twelve American and European museums  in 2005 he donated the bulk of his collection to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington  D.C. The catalog of his Ikat collection was given the George Wittenborn Memorial Award in 1997.A memorial service to celebrate Goldman’s life and work will be planned as soon as it is possible to convene in person.
Biologist Rob Lue  founding HarvardX faculty director  dies at 56,Sean Eddy stood awkwardly next to fossil exhibits at a 2015 wine reception at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. He was new to the University and didn’t know a soul. Then up strolled a smiling Rob Lue  who “started telling me about his new work on data-driven urban planning in Paris  and we immediately hit it off ” Eddy recalls.The Ellmore C. Patterson Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and department chair would eventually come to learn that Lue was a highly regarded researcher  an energetic leader in innovative teaching  and roundly cherished for his warm and generous spirit. “Rob was an optimist with a passion that would draw you in and get you talking with him about the good things in the world — art and books and education — and how we could make the world an even better place together ” Eddy said. “He saw the best in people.”Lue  who died Wednesday at 56 from cancer  had an impact felt deeply among undergraduates on campus and beyond. He was professor of the practice in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology  founding faculty director of HarvardX  faculty director of the Harvard Ed Portal  Richard L. Menschel Faculty Director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning  UNESCO Chair on Life Sciences and Social Innovation  and faculty director and principal investigator of LabXchange.“Rob was one of the most creative teachers at Harvard ” said Harvard President Larry Bacow. “He was always thinking about how we could do a better job of engaging our students  and he was particularly gifted in imagining how technology and data could be used to enhance the learning experience. One of my last in-person meetings before we began working remotely was with him. His confidence in our ability to teach even complex lab-based courses gave me hope when hope was in short supply. The kindness and thoughtfulness he brought to his work over the years infuse many of the pedagogical improvements made at Harvard. He was a valued colleague  and he will be missed.”As the director of life sciences education at Harvard  Rob Lue led a complete redesign of the introductory undergraduate curriculum. Jon Chase/Harvard file photo“Rob was a consummate innovator who brought incomparable vision and creative energy to his many wide-ranging projects  to the great benefit of teachers and learners across the globe ” said Claudine Gay  the Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). “He was among the most warm  energetic  and generous colleagues I have been fortunate enough to know in my years at Harvard — and a master teacher on top of it. His leadership at the Bok Center reflected all of that and the important work he began there will continue. He leaves behind a tremendous legacy of imagination.”Born in 1964  Lue was raised in Jamaica and graduated from St. George’s College in Kingston in 1982. He earned a B.A. from the College of the Holy Cross in 1986. He then took a year off to paint at Brandeis University. Art would remain a source of constant joy even as his professional career veered toward the sciences. He earned his Ph.D. in biology at Harvard in 1995 and joined the molecular and cellular biology faculty four years later.His teaching methods and use of technology quickly garnered recognition. As the director of life sciences education at Harvard  he led a complete redesign of the introductory undergraduate curriculum that created some of the largest and most popular science courses on campus.“When Rob lectured  you could hear a pin drop as he enthralled the freshmen with his ability to engage them in the topic of the day — they hung on his every word — and he was a master of active learning in which he regularly challenged students with questions ” said Richard Losick  Maria Moors Cabot Professor of Biology at Harvard and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.“When Rob lectured  you could hear a pin drop as he enthralled the freshmen with his ability to engage them in the topic of the day …”— Richard Losick  Maria Moors Cabot Professor of BiologyAt the Harvard Ed Portal  Lue was key in developing and defining its mission  programs  and extensive outreach to the Allston-Brighton community. In 2012  Lue became the founding faculty director of HarvardX and helped shape Harvard’s engagement in online learning and expand its reach and impact globally. The next year he was named the inaugural faculty director of the Bok Center and helped elevate its profile on campus.“Rob was a fountain of new ideas ” said Tamara Brenner  the Bok Center’s executive director. “Under his leadership  he transformed the Bok Center to a place that attracts and energizes faculty and graduate students alike  and that sparks creativity about what can happen in the classroom.”“His belief that science education should be accessible to everyone carried his work forward ” said Maile Takahashi  director of community programming at Harvard  who worked closely with Lue as part of his work with the Ed Portal.Up until his death  Lue was leading LabXchange  an initiative with the Amgen Foundation that created a free  online science learning platform for high school and college students. It also focused on promoting diversity in the field. The site has had over 2.5 million visitors since it launched 11 months ago. More than 250 000 of them have been educators and students using the platform to log over 112 000 hours of teaching and learning. This fall  Lue launched the Lemann Program on Creativity and Entrepreneurship to help students contribute to solving global challenges  such as climate change and social injustice.Lue’s vision was to improve education “by bringing equal opportunities for learning science [to] anyone and anywhere ” said Valtencir Mendes  senior programme lead in UNESCO’s education sector. “At UNESCO  Rob was known for his commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. He believed he could bring students  educators  volunteers  and collective intelligence together to help to solve our local and global challenges.”
Documentary photographer Chris Killip dies at 74,Renowned documentary photographer and former professor of visual and environmental studies Chris Killip died from lung cancer on Oct. 13. He was 74. Killip was a professor of photography in VES (now Art  Film  and Visual Studies) from 1991 to 2017  and the department chair from 1994 to 1998. For more than two decades  he had worked from the basement of the Carpenter Center  sharing his love of the art form with students and colleagues.“Photography and cinema both occupy the lowest level of the Carpenter Center  which is sometimes called the basement level. But Chris and I took to calling it thefoundationof the Carpenter Center because it was there that students were taught to make and to learn from images formed from light and shadow; a primary  alchemical art and craft inspired by the actual world with a unique mysterious intimacy and immediacy ” said Haden Guest  director of the Harvard Film Archive and senior lecturer on AFVS.“He was a gifted and passionate teacher ” said Robb Moss  Harvard College Professor and current chair of the AFVS department. “He regularly followed up with students who were having a difficult time. He was often invited to their weddings. We were lucky to have him as a friend and colleague for so many years  and we will miss him.”Born in Douglas on the Isle of Man  Killip left school at age 16 to work in the hospitality industry. After working as a commercial photography assistant in London for years  he returned to the Isle of Man in the early 1970s to capture his hometown on film  working in his father’s pub at night. He published his first book of photography  “Isle of Man ” in 1980.Mr. Johnny Moore  Ballalonna  Isle of Man  1971. Photo by Chris KillipIn 1988  Killip published his second and most famous book of photographs  “In Flagrante ” which captured the everyday fallout from deindustrialization and economic decline in northeastern England in the 1970s and 1980s. His arresting documentary style of photography captured the attention of critics and viewers alike  and Killip received the inaugural Henri Cartier-Bresson Award  now called le Prix HCP.“True to his innkeeper upbringing  Chris would often open his home to the department following art openings  film screenings  or holidays. He liked for people to get together and have a good time ” said Moss. “Chris could be irreverent  impertinent  and a brilliant responder to images. If you knew him  he was also warm  funny  and exquisitely aware of his surroundings and the class distinctions that often go unremarked upon in North American society.”From the skinhead in 1976’s “Youth on Wall  Jarrow  Tyneside” to the contemplative child in “Simon being taken to sea for the first time since his father drowned” in 1983  Killip imbued his images with a deep sense of empathy and understanding. He gained the trust of his subjects and avoided exploitation in his pursuit of authenticity and beauty.“Chris taught us that the position of the photographer is a moral and ethical stance ” said Guest. “I see Chris’ work as a shining example of art that makes clear its necessity through its beauty and intimacy and compassion  but also through the ways his images dignify his working-class subjects by frankly acknowledging and never romanticizing their struggles and singularities  practice that is profoundly important.”His books of photography included four large-format zines published in 2018: “Portraits ” “The Station ” “Skinningrove ” and “The Last Ships.”“His photographs embodied Henri Cartier-Bresson’s emphasis on the decisive moments  and Josef Koudelka’s eye for the surreal. He captured in arresting black-and-white photographs fleeting moments filled with powerful emotions ” said AFVS Professor Sharon Harper. “He was looking closely at people  labor  and the plight of the worker.”

Former U.S. Ambassador Walter Carrington dies at 90,Walter Charles Carrington ’52  J.D. ’55  passed away on Aug. 11 at the age of 90. Carrington was a former U.S. ambassador to Senegal and Nigeria and civil rights activist.Carrington  who came to Harvard College in 1948  was one of four Black students accepted. He founded the first Harvard chapter of the NAACP while he was president of the Harvard Society for Minority Rights. In addition  he was leader of the Liberal Union and a Class Marshal. Carrington’s years at  Harvard were also highlighted by a debate with Malcom X and befriending the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Throughout the years  Carrington remained close to Harvard  including his relationship with the Center for African Studies.Carrington was a distinguished American diplomat who served as the U.S. ambassador to Senegal at the end of the Carter administration (1980-81) and as President Clinton’s ambassador to Nigeria (1993-97).Before his foreign service career  he had vast experience working on the African continent through his career in the Peace Corps  which brought him to Tunisia  Senegal  and Sierra Leone from 1961 to 1971. After the Peace Corps  Carrington held the position of executive vice president of theAfrica-American Institutefrom 1971 to 1980.Tributes to Carrington“WalterOmowaleCarrington was of that breed that provokes the time-honored  nostalgic sentiment  a cliché that is however grounded in unvarnished truth: ‘They don’t make them like that anymore.’”— Wole SoyinkaNobel Prize-winning Nigerian playwright and poet“Erin Wo  ‘the elephant has fallen’ as we will say in Yoruba Nigerian culture where Ambassador Carrington was given the name Omowale (this child has come home) in recognition of his return to Nigeria as an African American and Ambassador. But more significantly  it was to recognize his many contributions to the country he loved so much. His finesse  gentle  humble and sincere life became reference point to many who knew him. Our students here at Harvard who attend the ‘Nigeria and the world seminar ’ which Carrington never missed  saw him as a benevolent grandfather and role model worth emulating. May his place of rest be a blessed one. He will be surely missed by all of us.”—Jacob OluponaProfessor of African religious traditions and professor of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University“Walter embodied the very best in the Black pioneers in the Harvard student body: he was wise  thoughtful  elegant  possessed of a penetrating intellect and a deep determination to fight racism and help other Black people gain access to opportunities  such as admission to Harvard  that racist practices historically limited. He was something of a hero to me  a living embodiment of traditions of intellectual excellence and service in the African American community during segregation that one only reads about.”—Henry Louis Gates Jr.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityCarrington also held various positions in academia. He was named director of the Department of International Affairs at Howard University and also taught at Marquette University  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Simmons College  and Washington College.

Leading Harvard economist Emmanuel Farhi dies at 41,While he was growing up in France  Emmanuel Farhi’s academic talent in number-driven disciplines was apparent  so it was less than shocking that he would become an award-winning macroeconomist whose work  while highly technical  shed important light on real-world fiscal policies.Both students and colleagues could not help but be deeply impressed by the intellect of the Robert C. Waggoner Professor of Economics. What did sometimes catch people by surprise about the 41-year-old Farhi  who died unexpectedly last Thursday in Cambridge  were the depth of his interest and knowledge of culture  both high and popular  and how genuine  friendly  and kind he was.“Emmanuel was an absolutely brilliant and prolific scholar  a deep and insightful theorist ” said Jeremy Stein  the Moise Y. Safra Professor of Economics and chair of the Department of Economics. “He was also a generous and caring mentor to his students  and a warm and cherished friend to many colleagues. He will be terribly missed by all of us.”“With all his talent he could have been a jerk  but he deeply cared about being a good human being ” said Gita Gopinath  the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and of Economics and the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. “He generously shared his time and wisdom with students and colleagues. On numerous counts he helped me get ‘unstuck’ in my research. … I am eternally grateful for 14 years of conversations and shared meals. He has left a void that can never be filled.”Born in Paris in 1978  Farhi won a national physics competition in France when he was 16 and went on to earn the highest score on the national entry exam to the elite engineering school École Polytechnique in 1997 before ultimately attending another prestigious French graduate school  École Normale Supérieure. There  Farhi decided to follow his father’s career path and become an economist.“Emmanuel had such ease that studying seemed a game for him ” said Michel Vigier  Farhi’s godfather. “The choice to specialize in economy arose out of loyalty to his father  André Farhi  an expert in Third World countries’ economic issues  who also died early.”“[Emmanuel Farhi] was a generous and caring mentor to his students  and a warm and cherished friend to many colleagues. He will be terribly missed by all of us.”— Jeremy Stein  chair of the Department of EconomicsFarhi came to the U.S. to finish his education  earning a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006. That same year he began working at Harvard as assistant professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He received tenure four years later when he was named a full professor.One of the leading economists of his generation both in the U.S. and in France  Farhi’s research focused on macroeconomics and finance  specifically on financial stability and reforming the international monetary system. A former economic adviser to French Prime Minister François Fillon  the International Monetary Fund named Farhi one of the 25 best economists under 45 in 2014.Farhi’s work cast a spotlight on a range of issues  including monetary economics  public finance  international economics  global imbalances  fiscal policy  and taxation. He also focused on issues like mitigating the impacts of economic crises and macroprudential regulation  a system used to describe the laws  rules  and conditions for banks and financial organizations that are meant to protect the whole financial system from risk.Farhi’s papers have been published in several prominent academic journals  and he authored two books. At the time of his death he was working on new methods for analyzing the macroeconomy as a network of interacting sectors or industries and analyzing how disruptions — such as those caused by the coronavirus pandemic — ripple through and have cascading effects. This approach was generating excitement in the field  said Farhi’s frequent co-author Xavier Gabaix.“He was one of the greatest minds of his generation in economics ” said Gabaix  Harvard’s Pershing Square Professor of Economics and Finance. “It was always about explaining the world and explaining what we should do so that the world could be in a better place [economically] and better managed so that we avoid trade wars and currency wars. It was deep thinking to make macroeconomic policy more successful and improve world welfare.”“I have known him for years  but we developed a much closer intellectual relationship over the past few months  when we have been working together on the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and on the relationship between epidemiological measures and the macroeconomy ” said James H. Stock the Harold Hitchings Burbank Professor of Political Economy. “He was very interested in sectoral details and supply chains  and our work aimed to connect the crisis to those issues  as well as to quantify the extent to which pure economic lockdowns  as opposed to other non-economic measures such as social distancing  masks  protecting the elderly  testing  etc. could stem both deaths and the toll that the virus is taking on the economy.”Farhi received several awards for his efforts  including the Bernacèr Prize for the best European economist under the age of 40 by the Observatory of the European Central Bank (2009)  the Malinvaud prize by the French Economic Association (2011)  the Best Young Economist prize by Le Monde and the Cercles des Economistes (2013)  and the Banque de France and Toulouse School of Economics prize in macroeconomics and finance (2013).“I will miss all of our conversations ” Gabaix said  recalling the long walks he and Farhi often took around Harvard Yard to speculate about world affairs and different economic theories. Those treasured conversations sometimes led to new research papers. “He was a wonderful friend. He was always engaged  passionate  and insightful.”It is those characteristics Farhi’s family and other colleagues remember too — along with Farhi’s jovial personality and a wealth of knowledge that ranged from world affairs to viral videos.“Emmanuel was very kind and quite playful ” said his cousin Julie Rojas  who  like much of his family  lives in France.He “had a wonderful sense of humor ” added Lina Chocteau  another cousin  who said Farhi was like a son to her. “Among many things  I will miss his listening  his smile  and the way he laughed.”Stefanie Stantcheva  professor of economics  said Farhi was “incredible to be around because of the depth of his general culture in the arts  his passion for research and science more broadly  and his warm and kind attitude. I always came out of our meetings with recommendations for books to read  movies to watch  exhibitions to visit (especially in Paris  where we are both from).”Farhi was also known as a mentor willing to take chances on students  letting them know what worked or didn’t in their work  and  most of all  for providing sage advice. Ben Golub  associate professor of economics  took to Twitter to recall one exchange.“I was too shy to talk to him often  but every interaction was a big  inspiring  deal for me ” Golub wrote in the five-parttweet. “Walking past his office late one afternoon  his door was open and he was giving advice to a young student. I couldn’t help slowing down because I wanted the advice  too. The bit I caught was ‘… you have to work hard toward something that you like. And for that there has tobesomething that you like and want there to be more of. And you have toknowwhat you like. Your first job is to figure out what that is.’”On Saturday  the Harvard Economics Department held a virtual gathering of staff and students in Farhi’s memory.Farhi is survived by his mother  Danièle Debordeaux  and his partner  Micol.The Daily GazetteSign up for daily emails to get the latest Harvard news.
The conscience of a nation,Few political leaders who successfully transition from activists to lawmakers do so without losing the fire and focus on the causes that brought them to prominence. But Civil Rights icon and U.S. Rep.John Lewis  the 17-term Georgia Democrat  was that kind of rare leader  never wavering from his original mission  to see that Black people in America were treated justly  equally  and with dignity.Unlike other icons of the Civil Rights era whose deaths years ago compressed their memories into historical abstractions for later generations  Lewis was a living  breathing  outspoken testament to the nation’s enduring mistreatment of African Americans. From theFreedom Rideshe took to desegregate buses  to the body blows he endured at Selma  Ala.  and elsewhere  to the stirring words he summoned to push for bold change  to bearing witness at moments of national triumph and setback  Lewis came to embody the nation’s physical  political. and spiritual struggle over Civil Rights.Lewis  who was Harvard’sCommencement speakerin 2018 and received an honorary degree in 2012   died Friday at age 80. He had announced in December that he had stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
Breaking barriers,Humble and soft-spoken  Deborah Washington Brown would never have described herself as a trailblazer.But as the first Black woman to graduate from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1981with a Ph.D. in applied mathematics  she shattered the racial and gender barriers that still plague technology fields today.Brown was the first Black computer scientist to earn a Ph.D. in the applied mathematics program atHarvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  and also one of the first Black  female computer scientists to graduate from a U.S. doctoral program.Though she passed away on June 5 after a long battle with cancer  her achievements and legacy remain as an inspiration for those who have followed in her footsteps.Brown was born in Washington  D.C.  on June 3  1952. The youngest of four children  Brown’s mother worked as a hairdresser and her father was a taxi cab driver. Her parents  who had both grown up in the segregated south  worked hard to provide a better life for their children and encouraged Brown and her siblings to explore their passions.From an early age  Brown was passionate about math and music.“She was the family brainiac ” her daughter  Laurel Brown  recalls. “One time  when she was a young girl  she and her siblings went with their uncle on a cross-country road trip. Their uncle was a bit of a spendthrift  so he designated my mother to be his human calculator. She was in charge of calculating the gas mileage and making sure he wasn’t spending too much money on the road trip. She always had this propensity for math and numbers.”
Recalling a pioneer of modern political economy,Alberto Alesina  one of the world’s most influential economists who applied economic analysis to thorny social and political problems and helped found the field of modern political economy  died Saturday at age 63 of an apparent heart attack while hiking with his wife  Susan. He taught at Harvard for more than three decades.Alesina  Ph.D. ’86  was the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of Political Economy and a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Alesina had directed the bureau’s Political Economic Program since its creation in 2006. According toDani Rodrik  Ford Foundation Professor of International Political Economy at the Kennedy School of Government  Alesina almost single-handedly established the interdisciplinary field  which has become a vital tool in public policy across a range of issues.Trained as a macroeconomist  Alesina believed in expanding the frontiers of economics into the spheres of political science and sociology. He was a trailblazer in the use of economic tools to understand fundamental questions about the organization and behavior of various cultures and societies  such as how political instability affects economic growth or why Americans are less willing than Europeans to consider ways to promote redistribution of wealth.Because of the wide-ranging impact of his work  Alesina was for years considered a likely and worthy contender for the Nobel Prize in Economics  said Ed Glaeser  the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics. His work on how ethnic fragmentation harms economic performance predicted the recent backlash against immigration in the U.S. and Europe; and his studies about the optimal size of nation-states had a large influence on debates around the European Union. A paper co-authored in 1993 by Alesina and Harvard PresidentEmeritus andCharles W. Eliot University ProfessorLawrence Summers  then a U.S. Treasury official  showed that independent central banks can best control inflation  which played a role in the movement toward central bank independence.“The hallmark of Alberto Alesina is that he asked extraordinarily interesting questions about just about everything  and he came up with really interesting answers and opened up whole fields.”— Jeffry Frieden“Alberto’s reach was boundless ” saidStefanie Stantcheva  professor of economics and a close collaborator of Alesina  in an email to the Gazette. “Taking a genuinely interdisciplinary approach that combined economics with political science  sociology  history  and even cultural anthropology  he transformed economics for the better.”In recent years Stantcheva and Alesina had examined the sizable differences between people’s perceptions and reality  a timely topic in this age of polarization. One paper showed that pervasive misperceptions about immigration undermine support for redistributive programs. Another found that Americans are polarized not only over policy  but even in their perception of verifiable reality. The authors also showed that Americans are overly optimistic about the possibility of achieving the American dream of upward mobility while Europeans are overly pessimistic about their prospects for rising.Widely regarded as one of the most creative economists of his time  Alesina was known for having a knack for finding important questions that nobody had asked before  and for coming up with big ideas that influenced generations of researchers.As a scholar  Alesina was a force of nature  saidJeffry Frieden  professor of government. The questions Alesina raised  he said  were driven by an endless curiosity and vast energy  whether it was why there is so often divided government in the U.S. or how the plow changed the role of women in society.“The hallmark of Alberto Alesina is that he asked extraordinarily interesting questions about just about everything  and he came up with really interesting answers and opened up whole fields ” said Frieden in a phone interview. “He worked on economic policy  and that is a continuing field within political economy. He studied political economy and culture  and there is now an NBER group that studies political economy and culture. Virtually every set of topics that he got interested in  he created or contributed to the creation of an ongoing strand of research that carries on.”The Italian-born economist was not afraid of controversy. Alesina earned some criticism when he became a proponent of fiscal austerity during the Great Recession of 2008‒2009. On May 19  the Manhattan Institute  a free-market think tank  awarded its prestigious Hayek Book Prize to a work he produced with Carlo Favero and Francesco Giavazzi titled “Austerity: When It Works and When It Doesn’t.” That book argued that  in some cases  spending cuts to reduce budget deficits are less harmful than tax increases.The news of Alesina’s death led to anoutpouringof tributes from friends  colleagues  and former students who spoke of his warm personality  self-deprecating humor  generosity  and of the many ways he inspired them. Glaeser wrote of how “his wisdom and warmth could light any seminar room  and even bring life to a faculty meeting.”Stantcheva  recalling Alesina’s wit  said that he was not “just one of the world’s finest economists  but he was among the funniest ones.” Frieden said he was going to miss his laugh and joking around with him. “We kidded each other pretty mercilessly  he for my love of baseball  me for his inability to appreciate the greatest of all games ” Frieden said.He was not “just one of the world’s finest economists  but he was among the funniest ones.”— Stefanie StantchevaIn a piece published Sunday in The Washington Post  Summers wrote of his friendship with Alesina and the mark he left as a scholar. The two met when Alesina was a graduate student at Harvard in the 1980s.“It is hard to imagine the field of political economy without him ” Summers wrote in his appreciation. “At the time  there were a few economists interested in understanding politics rather than telling politicians what to do. And there were a few political scientists interested in economic issues. But there was no academic field of political economy. Today  political economy is an important component of economics and political science.”At Harvard  Alesina taught classes on the role of culture in economics and the many areas of political economy  including theories of economic reform  privatization  and elections.Alesina’s role as a mentor to students was well-known  saidJeremy Stein  chair of the Economics Department and the Moise Y. Safra Professor of Economics. “When he would poke his head in my door to chat  it was often to check in about a student we had in common  to make sure they were doing OK not only in their work  but on a personal level ” said Stein.Alesina was chair of the Economics Department from 2003‒2006. He was a member of the Center for Economic Policy Research  the Econometric Society  and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics.A prolific writer  he published 142 articles in academic journals  often in collaboration with other economists and doctoral students. He remained connected to his beloved Italy through his alma mater  Bocconi University  and the columns he published in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.“He was devoted to his students  going out of his way to help their careers  but you could just as easily walk into his office cold for the first time …”— Dani RodrikBut as much as he loved his work  Alesina’s passion for life was legendary. He loved hiking  skiing  the opera  and the Rolling Stones. Students often found a sign hanging on his door that said  “Why work when you can ski?”Alesina’s legacy will be felt in the field of political economy  but the memory of his gentle spirit and warm soul will be treasured by his friends  students  and colleagues. In an email  Rodrik said Alesina’s playful mind  contagious laugh  and unassuming personality stood out  as did his warmth and affection for others.“He was also one of the friendliest  most open personalities in the economics world ” said Rodrik. “He was devoted to his students  going out of his way to help their careers  but you could just as easily walk into his office cold for the first time  and you would encounter someone who was interested in what you had to say  would follow up with questions  and would crack a joke or two before you left. What made him a great friend as well as a scholar was that the childish wonder he had for the world and how it worked (or didn’t) never left him.”
Respected teacher and administrator Richard M. Hunt dies at 93,The Harvard historian who literally wrote the book on his beloved alma mater died peacefully on April 10 at his home in Lincoln  Mass. Richard McMasters Hunt  a faculty member in social studies for 42 years and University Marshal for two decades  was 93.Born and raised in Pittsburgh  Hunt graduated from St. Paul’s School in Concord  N.H.  in 1944 and Yale University in 1949. During World War II  he served in India with the American Field Service  and then later attended Columbia  where he earned his master’s degree in 1951. He held a Ph.D. from Harvard in history  which he completed in 1960.In all  Hunt spent nearly 50 years on Harvard’s campus as a respected teacher statesman  and keeper of its storied history. He was a senior lecturer in social studies  University Marshal from 1982–2002  and assistant  and later  associate dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences during the 1960s and ’70s.AsUniversity Marshal  Hunt represented the President and Fellows of Harvard College in all matters of protocol  including welcoming international visitors and heads of state to the University.“Rick was so well suited to the role of University Marshal. He was gracious and always dignified ” saidMargot Gill  Harvard’s current interim University Marshal and the administrative dean for international affairs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “There is hardly ever a time as I greet our international guests and welcome these delegations to Harvard that I don’t think about Rick Hunt. … He is still a presence here.”In that role Hunt also presided over special convocations  including Commencement. Colleagues say that he was known for his remarkable gift of diplomacy and for the way he was able to maintain great relationships across the University  attributes that ensured the success of the Commencement proceedings that unfolded under his nurturing watch.“His children learned early from him how much more interesting it is to find out about others than it is to speak about oneself.”— Susan Hunt HollingsworthGrace Scheibner  whom Hunt hired as Commencement director in 1993  fondly recalled Hunt’s mentorship while working alongside him over the course of 25 years. She still holds onto a handwritten note that Hunt had placed on her desk chair after finishing their first Commencement together. It reads  “Grace  a thousand thanks. Thank you a thousand times — Rick.”“Rick was one of the most special people I have ever met  and I am grateful and deeply honored to have had the privilege of working with and learning from him ” she said. “He was a true living legend.”Following his retirement  Hunt co-wrote the book “Harvard A to Z ” a collection of essays about the University’s history  from stories about its famous alumni and scholars to informative musings on its well-known landmarks and its lesser-known curiosities. “Rick loved telling Harvard stories ” said Gill. “He saw himself as the keeper of many of Harvard’s most cherished traditions.”Hunt also adored the people within the Harvard community. The late Rev.Peter Gomes  long the Pusey Minister at Harvard’s Memorial Church  was a close friend  dedicating his collection of sermons “What We Forgot to Tell You” to Hunt  under the inscription:With careful and considerate confidencehe ordered our public occasionswhile sustaining with quiet convictionour communities of faith.Not all of Harvard’s Marshals have been Harvard faculty  but Hunt was  and he was a respected educator. He long taught a core curriculum course on Weimar and Nazi Germany  as well as a social studies junior tutorial on leadership and followership  while serving as chairman of the Faculty Committee on Religion  and as a member of the social studies and Center for European Studies committees.“Rick was a true educator in every sense and in many roles at Harvard ” saidTerry Aladjem  a lecturer on social studies and the former executive director of the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. “In our too-infrequent lunches  he would ask probing questions about the Bok Center — as he cared deeply about teaching at Harvard  the cultivation of our graduate students  and so much appreciated the center as a living tribute to former President Derek Bok. As a scholar  he taught perhaps the longest-running tutorial in social studies on leadership and followership and was remarkably insightful about the nature of totalitarianism. One knows he was a phenomenal teacher because he would hold you in his attention completely  and it was impossible to leave a conversation with him without being enlightened. We have lost a truly wise and caring man.”“There is hardly ever a time as I greet our international guests and welcome these delegations to Harvard that I don’t think about Rick Hunt. … He is still a presence here.”— Margot GillHunt led a busy life outside of Harvard  too  where he served as president of the American Council on Germany  a nonprofit organization devoted to strengthening American-German relations for 40 years  and he supported various organizations as a philanthropist  including as founding trustee of the Roy A. Hunt Foundation  named after his father  who was president of the aluminum giant Alcoa for 30 years. He was also a founding board member and vice chair of the National Center for Family Philanthropy.Outside of his academic and philanthropic interests  Hunt maintained a variety of passions  in particular opera  magic  and tennis. A member of the Yale tennis team in the 1940s  he finally gave up the sport when his knees no longer allowed him to play. By then  he was in his late 80s. In those later years  Hunt played what he referred to as “Cinderella tennis ” wrote his daughter Susan Hunt Hollingsworth ina remembrance of her father  which meant he was “just hoping to make it to the ball.”“Rick Hunt was an admirable person in every sense of the word — kind  generous  capable  conscientious  and invariably decent toward everyone he encountered ” said former Harvard PresidentDerek Bok. “His true nature was revealed to me most clearly on the tennis court  where we met more times than I can possibly remember. He would occasionally make a bad call to end a point. Without exception  every one of these mistakes involved calling my ball in when it was really out  never the reverse. He was a loyal and accomplished colleague  who accomplished a lot for Harvard as a teacher and administrator. I count it a great privilege to have known him well.”Hunt was a keen listener and lifelong learner  whether on campus or off. Wrote daughter Susan  “His children learned early from him how much more interesting it is to find out about others than it is to speak about oneself.” His son  Bill  added  “Our father defined ‘Renaissance Man.’ He read and studied nearly every conceivable subject  from ancient cultures  modern politics  and the strategy of the previous night’s Red Sox game. Most importantly  he was always interested in listening to others about their own interests and experiences. Everyone who knew him was dazzled by his unbounded intellectual curiosity.”Hunt is survived by his wife of 65 years  Priscilla Stevenson Hunt; their three children  Helen Hunt Bouscaren (Joe) of Cambridge  Mass.; Susan Hunt Hollingsworth (Mark) of Cleveland; and William “Bill” Edwards Hunt (Janet) of Pittsburgh; and eight grandchildren  Sophie  Justin  Isaac  Travis  Russell  Eli  Lindsay  and Lily.A memorial service will be held at a future date.

James McCarthy  environmentalist  dead at 75,James J. McCarthy  Alexander Agassiz Professor of Biological Oceanography and directoremeritusof the Museum of Comparative Zoology  died on Dec. 11 after a long battle with pulmonary fibrosis. He was 75.A champion of the environment  McCarthy  known as Jim  was committed to both education and advocacy about climate change.“A profound lesson from the past few decades of scientific discovery across the Earth and life sciences is that the weight of the human footprint on essential life-supporting services of the Earth system has grown dramatically since the time of Darwin ” he wrote in 2009 in an article for the journal Science  “Reflections On: Our Planet and Its Life  Origins  and Futures.”“Could Darwin have imagined that so soon in Earth history a single species would be altering the prospects for the survival of other species across all continents and to the greatest depths of the sea?” he wrote.Committed to the application of science to public policy  McCarthy led numerous international scientific efforts to alert the world to the effects of climate change. The founding editor of the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles  he also served as co-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  as a lead author of the 2005 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment  and as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008. In 2012  President Barack Obama appointed McCarthy to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. In 2018  he received the prestigious Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement for his work on phytoplankton productivity amid climate change  and his outstanding leadership in the field of science policy. McCarthy shared the award with fellow biological oceanographer  Peter Falkowski  of Rutgers University.A dedicated fly fisher who angled for trout in his spare time  McCarthy’s scholarship steered him toward the sea. His primary research focused on plankton  and his work on nutrient controls on ocean productivity resulted in many awards  including the New England Aquarium’s David B. Stone Award (2005) for distinguished service to the environment and the community  and the Museum of Science’s Walker Prize  which recognizes “meritorious published scientific investigation and discovery” (2008).“Nobody communicated the importance of the climate crisis in the context of the oceans as eloquently and passionately as Jim.”— Al Gore  former vice presidentKen Kimmel  president of the Union of Concerned Scientists  remembered his colleague and former USC board chair on itswebsite  calling him “a passionate advocate for the essential role science plays in our democracy” and “a key architect in the formation of our Center for Science and Democracy in 2011.”Many of his fellow scientists and environmentalists and former students posted on amemorial pageset up by the Harvard University Center for the Environment.“Dr. James McCarthy was an amazing man  a loyal friend  world-class oceanographer  a passionate advocate for science and for our climate balance ” wrote former Vice President Al Gore. “Nobody communicated the importance of the climate crisis in the context of the oceans as eloquently and passionately as Jim. His dedication to better understanding our planet through its oceans will continue to enable and empower us as activists  citizens  and leaders fighting to solve this crisis.”He was also remembered for his impact as an educator.“Jim was the kindest  sparkliest  most deeply committed person I’ve known at Harvard ” wrote Samuel S. Myers ’87  principal research scientist  Department of Environmental Health  Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health  and director of the Planetary Health Alliance. “Whether mentoring me on science and spirituality or on a trout stream  his gentleness of spirit  his glittering enthusiasm  his curiosity  and his love came through. When the world needs it most  a great light has gone out.”A native of Sweet Home  Oregon  McCarthy received his undergraduate degree in biology from Gonzaga University and his Ph.D. from Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He came to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1974  following postdoctoral and research scientist positions at Johns Hopkins.
Memorial service set for Richard E. Kronauer,Richard E. Kronauer  94  the Gordon McKay Professor of Mechanical Engineering Emeritus Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  passed away in Tucson  Ariz.  on Oct. 18  2019.A memorial service is planned for 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at the Harvard Unitarian Universalist Church in Harvard  Mass.  where Kronauer was a member since 1954.  A reception will follow at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kronauer in Harvard.  All faculty  students  and friends are welcomed.Kronauer  M.S. ’48  Ph.D.  ’51  had completed another paper with Harvard Medical School  which was published several weeks before his death.Though experienced with research in bothfluid mechanicsandapplied mathematics  he was primarily known for his pioneering work inmathematical biology  especially research on humancircadian rhythms. Kronauer’s 1982 paper “Mathematical model of the human circadian system with two interacting oscillators” outlined a new method for understanding the biological circuits that underlie daily body cycles in variables such as blood pressure or body temperature. Kronauer’s research also had direct implications for the causes and possible cures for many types of sleep disorders  and for this he received theFarrell Prizein Sleep Medicine in June 2008.He is survived by his three children  Karen Edwards Kronauer  Charles Richard Kronauer  and Anne Kronauer Saetren; and six grandchildren.
John H. McArthur dies  was Business School dean from 1980-95,John H. McArthur  a member of the Harvard Business School (HBS) community for more than six decades — as student (M.B.A. 1959 and D.B.A. 1963)  as faculty member (beginning in 1962)  as dean (from 1980 to 1995)  and as Dean and George F. Baker Professor of Administration  emeritus— died on Aug. 20. He was 85.McArthur’s energy and leadership kept HBS at the forefront of business education and laid a foundation of intellectual growth and development on which the School continues to build today. His contributions extended far beyond HBS  enhancing the Greater Boston region as well as organizations and institutions around the globe  including in his home country of Canada.McArthur’s association with HBS began in 1957 when he arrived on campus from Vancouver. His standout performance in the M.B.A. program led to a scholarship in the School’s doctoral program  launching his remarkable career as a scholar  teacher  and administrator and culminating with his appointment as the School’s seventh dean.McArthur’s vision  passion  and unparalleled gift for building consensus transformed the School. “John felt strongly the responsibility he carried as leader of HBS ” said Nitin Nohria  dean of Harvard Business School. “He cared deeply about every member of the HBS community and believed in the School’s ability to transform lives. By encouraging us all to dream big dreams — in effect  spurring our intellectual ambition — he set the School on a remarkable trajectory.”McArthur is credited with building the faculty through the recruitment and promotion of outstanding faculty members  strengthening research  enhancing Executive Education  and launching important initiatives in ethics and social enterprise. He oversaw a major campus master planning and renewal effort and restructured the School’s publishing arm to expand the reach and impact of the School and its thought leadership throughout the world. He launched “Leadership and Learning ” a comprehensive M.B.A. curriculum review.During McArthur’s 15 years as dean  endowed professorships rose from 50 to 81  the annual budget for research and course development increased from $10 million to $50 million  and the HBS endowment increased from $106 million to $600 million.McArthur’s impact extended far beyond the Harvard Business School. Over the decades  he held numerous corporate directorships  committee memberships  and consulting posts in business  government  education  and health care organizations around the world.For many years  he served as chair of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH)  which sparked a lifelong passion for the health-care sector. He was the moving force behind the 1994 merger of BWH and Massachusetts General Hospital.

Remembering Anne Monius  54,Anne E. Monius  professor of South Asian religions at Harvard Divinity School  passed away Aug. 3  at the age of 54. She died of natural causes.A distinguished scholar and engaging teacher  Monius taught for 17 years at Harvard Divinity School (HDS)  where she specialized in the religious traditions of India. Her research examined the practices and products of literary culture to reconstruct the history of religions in South Asia.“Formidably intelligent and rigorous as a scholar  infectiously curious and eclectic in her interests  and exemplary in her teaching and mentoring of students  it is hard to imagine HDS without Anne Monius ” saidHDS Dean David N. Hempton. “Her laughter  zest for life  and courage in the face of adversity were inspirational  as were her unfailing messages of gratitude. Everyone at HDS grieves with her family  the community of scholars across the world  and her beloved students  past and present. We will miss her more than words can convey  but we will not forget her values nor her impact on our lives.”Monius began teaching at HDS in 2002 as assistant professor of South Asian religions. She was granted tenure two years later and named to a full professorship. In 2013‒14  she served as the acting director of theCenter for the Study of World Religionsat HDS. Prior to teaching at Harvard  Monius spent five years teaching in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia.A historian of religion with particular interest in the Tamil culture of southern India  Monius’ 2001 book  “Imagining a Place for Buddhism: Literary Culture and Religious Community in Tamil-Speaking South India ” examined the two extant Buddhist texts composed in Tamil. Her book was based on her dissertation research  which took her to Chennai  India  for two years.Monius was at work on an upcoming book  “Singing the Lives of Śiva’s Saints: History  Aesthetics  and Religious Identity in Tamil-speaking South India ” which examined the formation of Saiva (Śiva-worship) identity in the medieval period of Tamil Nadu  when the Chola dynasty rose to prominence from the ninth through 12th centuries. What’s more  she was part of a team of scholars translating the Tamil version of the “Ramayana ” one of India’s great epic poems  and was also contributing to Penn State University Press’ Religion Around book series  which looks at how the work of cultural icons shaped and was shaped by their religious milieu. Monius’ subject was Bob Marley and Rastafari’s possible roots in Saiva culture.Her scholarship took her all over the world. Monius lectured and presented widely in the U.S. and beyond  including Canada  England  Germany  and Switzerland.In addition to her scholarship  Monius made a significant contribution to the lives of the countless students she advised. She offered guidance not only to students pursuing their doctoral degrees  but as a Harvard College alumna  she also made herself available to undergraduates in need of support. Her passion and dedication to mentoring was recognized by the student body  and in 2014 she received the prestigious Graduate Student Council’s Everett Mendelsohn Excellence in Mentoring Award  established to honor faculty members who go out of their way to support and guide graduate students’ research  education  professional and personal development  and career plans.“Professor Monius was a dedicated and inspired teacher to many  many students at Harvard and beyond  and she will be mourned and sorely missed ” said Janet Gyatso  Hershey Professor of Buddhist Studies and HDS associate dean for faculty and academic affairs. “She made very important contributions to the fields of Tamil studies  South Asian religions  and Buddhist studies  and was widely and highly regarded for her sharp intelligence  knowledge  and insight into many of the central questions of religious studies.”Monius graduatedsumma cum laudefrom Harvard College in 1987 and pursued her advanced studies at Harvard as well  earning her Ph.D. in 1997 from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.Attending Harvard was something Monius knew she would do  even as a child. A class filed trip to Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology when she was 8 years old was a moment that helped inspire her life-long love of learning. Inan April 2019 profile  Monius recalled how a chance encounter on that trip with art students sketching c animals left her asking questions.“It was like I had been living in a broom closet  and somebody opened up the door  and I had no idea what was going on ” Monius recalled. “But I wanted to know.”Monius returned home to New Hampshire and declared to her family that she would one day attend Harvard. Years later  she applied on her own initiative and was accepted.At HDS  she was known not only for her scholarship and teaching  but also for her special laugh.“Anne’s laughter was one of the great sounds of this world ” said Charles Hallisey  HDS’ Yehan Numata Senior Lecturer on Buddhist Literatures. “Just to hear her easy laugh made you want to rush to wherever she was. Her laugh made this world momentarily a better place  even when you heard it coming from the office next door; to be the cause of Anne’s laughter made you feel momentarily better about yourself. It seems just wrong that we and the world will have to go on without the sounds of her laughter to uplift us.“Anne was a scholar of great intelligence and erudition  both of which she shared freely with others; she was a scholar of great integrity  with a keen sense of academic ethics; and she was a creative and joyful scholar always filled with surprises  such as her learned passion for Bob Marley’s music. Anne was also a unique and remarkable teacher  exemplary in her generosity to her students  in her care for them  and in her dedication to them ” he said.A resident of Cambridge  Monius is survived by her parents  Eleanor and Felix Monius of Brookline  N.H.  her brother  Peter  and his wife  Melissa  her niece  Hannah  and her nephew  Sam.Amemorial gatheringto celebrate Anne E. Monius’ life will take place at 1 p.m. on Oct. 11 at Loeb House. The program will include tributes from her colleagues and students  music  and readings. A reception will follow at Loeb House from 2:30 to 4 p.m.In lieu of flowers  Monius’ family asks for donations in her memory in order to support financial aid for HDS students studying South Asian religions.

Martin Kilson  College’s first tenured African American professor  dies at 88,Martin Kilson  a scholar of class  power  and the challenges facing African Americans  died April 24 of congestive heart failure at age 88.Kilson  who in 1969 became the first African American to be named a full professor at Harvard College  taught at the College for nearly four decades  retiring in 1999 as the Frank G. Thompson Professor of GovernmentEmeritus. He died in hospice care in Lincoln  Mass.Early in his academic career  Kilson spent 18 months conducting research in Sierra Leone as that West African nation transitioned from British colonial rule to independence. The work resulted in the 1966 book “Political Change in a West African State: A Study of the Modernization Process in Sierra Leone ” and provided a foundation for Kilson’s work examining the interplay of power  political leadership  and race  both in Africa and in the African American community.Influenced by the scholarship of W.E.B. Du Bois  Kilson studied the rights and interests of the black American underclass. The 1976 essay collection he co-edited  “The African Diaspora: Interpretive Essays ” was the first published work to use the term “African diaspora.” Kilson was influential in the development of African American studies as both a discipline and a department at Harvard. His 2014 book  “The Transformation of the African American Intelligentsia  1880–2012 ” received the 2015 American Book Award.Throughout his career  Kilson kept up a vigorous and forceful public commentary about the state of African American affairs. He is the author of several books and hundreds of articles  both in academic journals and in the popular press. In 2010  he delivered Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Lectures.Kilson was born on Feb. 14  1931  in East Rutherford  N.J.  to a family with a history of service in the ministry. Two of his pre–Civil War great-grandfathers were among the founders of the first African Methodist Episcopal church among free blacks in Maryland.His family moved to Ambler  Pa.  and Kilson attended Ambler High School  graduating in 1948. He attended Lincoln University in Pennsylvania  graduating as valedictorian in 1953 with a bachelor’s of science degree in political science.Kilson studied at Harvard on a John Hay Whitney Fellowship  earning his Ph.D. in 1959 before leaving for his work in Sierra Leone. On his return  he became a research associate at Harvard’s Center for International Affairs. He was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Government in 1962. He became faculty adviser for the newly formed Harvard-Radcliffe Afro-American Students Association  and in 1969 became a professor of government at Harvard College  the first African American to receive tenure there.In 1975  Kilson received a Guggenheim Fellowship and  in 1988  was named the Frank G. Thompson Professor of Government  a title he held until his retirement in 1999.RelatedFaculty diversity continues to growPercentages of women and minorities who are tenured and tenure-track reach record highsOn having — and being — a role modelBridget Terry Long  HGSE’s recently appointed dean and the first African American in the position  seeks to inspire
Sidney Verba dies at 86,Sidney Verba  one of the world’s most prominent political scientists  taught at Harvard for 35 years  holding several key administrative posts and leaving a lasting influence beyond the classroom. He died Monday at his home in Cambridge at the age of 86.Verba  who was the Carl H. Pforzheimer University ProfessorEmeritusand research professor of government  undertook pioneering research on democratic participation  civic life  and political inequality. He wrote more than 20 books that examined citizen engagement and activism in democratic political life in the U.S. and around the world.His work  done in collaboration with many scholars over five decades  showed that people with higher income and education levels tended to be more active in civic and political life  revealing  in groundbreaking studies  that political inequality is deeply embedded in American society.“He was one of the greatest political scientists of the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st ” saidTheda Skocpol  the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard. “Sid had a passion for American democracy. He  along with his chief collaborators Kay Schlozman and Henry Brady  developed over the years the definitive theory and empirical research to understanding civic and political participation in the United States.”Verba’s work was driven by his concern for bringing equality to the American political system to allow all citizens to participate in civic and political life  saidGary King  the Weatherhead University Professor and director of theInstitute for Quantitative Social Science.“If you had to say one word that Sid was about ” said King  “it was equality. … It’s not only a good thing that we have a democracy  but what really matters is the roles of people in it. He showed very often that the poor  even though they officially have the same number of votes as the rich  they have much less say in what goes on in government.”Verba retired from teaching in 2007 but continued to work as chair of the Committee on Human Rights at the National Academy of Sciences until just a few years ago as a way to keep pursuing his intellectual interests in equality and justice.“It was a continuum ” said Cynthia Verba  his wife of 65 years. “He was very proud of the work [the committee was] doing.”Verba received many awards and honors for his contributions to political science. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Philosophical Society  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002  he won the Johan Skytte Prize  which has been described as the Nobel Prize for political science.As a scholar  Verba pioneered the use of survey research as central to the discipline in the 1963 book “The Civic Culture ” which he co-authored with Gabriel Almond. The groundbreaking work  which compared political attitudes in the U.S. to those in the U.K.  Germany  Mexico  and Italy  revolutionized political science.“The idea of American exceptionalism  that the United States was somehow different from everywhere else and couldn’t be compared  he just kind of blew that out of the water ” saidJennifer Hochschild  the H.L. Jayne Professor of Government  professor of African and African American Studies  and Harvard College professor. “A lot of people were influenced by the idea that you could systematically compare the United States to Mexico  to England  China  or Argentina. What he did shaped the field of comparative politics.”“If you had to say one word that Sid was about  it was equality. … It’s not only a good thing that we have a democracy  but what really matters is the roles of people in it.”— Gary KingIn the 1970s  Verba published books with several co-authors that were trailblazing in both analysis and methodology  and also set the agenda for different subfields in the discipline. Those were “Participation in America” with Norman Nie  “The Changing American Voter” with Nie and John Petrocik  and “Participation and Political Equality” with Nie and Jae-on Kim. His 1993 book “Designing Social Inquiry ” written with Gary King and Robert Keohane  is still used by every graduate student in political science.In 1995  he published “Voice and Equality ” co-written with Schlozman and Brady. The book examined patterns of political participation in the U.S. and brought the issue of inequality in political participation to the forefront. “Participation is unequal in politics and is structured  among other things  by socio-economic resources  especially education ” said Schlozman  the J. Joseph Moakley Professor at Boston College.Schlozman said that Verba  despite his prominence  treated junior faculty  graduate students  and even undergraduates as collaborators.“In a certain way  Sid lived the lessons of his research ” she said. “He allowed people to have a voice in an equal way. He had a way of … letting people have their say  and he knew how to get people on board to come to some kind of consensus [so that no one felt] left out.”Verba’s legacy was also felt beyond the classroom. He was widely beloved across the University not only because he was amiable and down-to-earth  charming everybody with his wit  self-deprecating humor  and fondness for telling jokes and stories  but also because he made time to mentor graduate students and junior faculty and possessed a special talent for bringing people together. “He was a mensch ” said Hochschild  who was a close friend of Verba’s. “He was wise  generous  and a moral leader  but one who didn’t take himself or things too seriously.”King said that when Verba entered a room  “everybody became nicer.” On many occasions  the University tapped Verba to chair committees in charge of solving problems that seemed impossible to fix. “The way I always describe it is that whenever Sid was there  nobody would act up ” said King. “He was the adult in the room  and because the adult was in the room  no one was on bad behavior. You just couldn’t act out with Sid there.”One of Verba’s greatest administrative feats was to unify the University’s academic calendar across all Schools and align it with those of most universities in the country. But his proudest achievement was his work at the library  said his wife.Verba was the longest-serving director of the University Library in Harvard’s history. He held the post between 1984 and 2007  during the dawn of the digital age  and led the Library Digital Initiative  the massive digitization of its books and materials that opened the University’s collections to a global audience.“A woman from Australia who wanted a book from Widener found out she could get it online in 24 hours and she wrote to him to say  ‘Thank you  Harvard ’” said Cynthia Verba. “That was his proudest moment  that the treasures of Harvard were opened to the world. Of all his accomplishments  that’s what he cherished the most.”Sarah Thomas  vice president of the Harvard Library  University librarian  and the Roy E. Larsen Librarian for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences  praised Verba’s commitment to preserve and protect the University’s materials and his vision to allow people around the world access to its valuable collections. “He comes from a tradition of scholar librarians who value the tradition of preserving our cultural knowledge and the way in which it is used ” she said.Born in New York City on May 26  1932  a son of Jewish immigrants who owned what he described as “a mom-and-pop curtain store” in Brooklyn  Verba graduated from Harvard in 1953 and received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1959. Before coming to Harvard  he taught at Princeton  Stanford University  and the University of Chicago.In a 2010 interview with Nancy Rosenblum  the associate editor of the Annual Review of Political Science  Verba credited his interest in politics to the fact that “there was always politics” in his family as he was growing up during the Depression. He had a positive outlook and saw himself as a fortunate man  said his wife. “He attributed everything to good luck ” she said. “He never believed he was better than anybody else and treated everybody as equal. He considered himself the luckiest man.”
Nobel physics laureate Roy Glauber dies at 93,Roy J. Glauber ’46  the pioneering theoretical physicist who received theNobel Prize in 2005and was one of the last living scientists to have been present for the dawn of the atomic age  died on Dec. 26  2018. He was 93.The research that set Glauber on the path to a Nobel began with his interest in a groundbreaking 1956 experiment that confirmed a key concept of quantum physics — that light was both a particle and a wave — and laid the groundwork for the field. His landmark 1963 paper  “The Quantum Theory of Optical Coherence ” used quantum mechanical tools to transform science’s understanding of light  which previously had only been studied using classical techniques.“We really did not have a complete understanding of the quantum properties of light  and what Roy’s work laid out was a framework for thinking about that ” said Mikhail Lukin  the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics and co-director of the Quantum Science and Engineering Initiative. “It allowed us to think about these types of questions quantitatively … so I would argue that his work very much laid the groundwork for the field of quantum science and technology that people are talking about right now.”Lukin said the theories outlined by Glauber opened the door for many scientific discoveries as well as next-generation technologies  including quantum computers and networks and the use of quantum cryptography  which relies on quantum mechanics to create impossible-to-crack codes.“Those ideas all grow out of this framework that he developed ” Lukin said. “Some people refer to these new developments as the second quantum revolution — the first was about understanding the laws of quantum mechanics. But in this second revolution … the idea is that now that we understand the quantum world and we can actually control it  let’s see what we can use it for. Can we build materials with properties which you design on demand? Can we build quantum computers? Can we build quantum networks where we can send information with absolute security from one side of the country to the other? These types of ideas very much depend on understanding where the classical world ends and the quantum world starts  and that’s where these ideas Roy pioneered and developed become absolutely critical.”Glauber graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and entered Harvard as a 16-year-old freshman  but left as a sophomore when he was recruited to join theManhattan Project where he worked with future Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman to calculate the critical mass of the first atomic bomb. Glauber was later present at the first tests of the bomb.Following World War II  he returned to Harvard to finish his undergraduate studies and later earn a Ph.D. After receiving his doctorate he was recruited to a position at the Institute for Advanced Study by Robert Oppenheimer  and worked there before returning to Harvard in 1952  where he spent the remainder of his career.Though he was known for taking his scientific work seriously  friends said Glauber wasn’t without a lighter side. For years  he was “keeper of the broom ” clearing the stage of paper airplanes thrown during the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony recognizing unusual or trivial scientific achievements.One of the few years Glauber missed the Ig Nobel ceremony was in 2005 — because he was in Stockholm collecting his real Nobel.“I think he took real glee in his role at the Ig Noble ceremony ” said Arthur Jaffe  the Landon T. Clay Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Science. “He loved to describe with a smile his role as the janitor  sweeping the stage at the end of the performance.”In his spare time  Jaffe said  Glauber had great interest in classical music. He and his partner  Atholie Rosett  occasionally hosted events for one local performing group in their home.“People consider him a father of … a huge area of physics that has been very prolific in modern life ” Jaffe said. “He always had a very clear opinion about his evaluation of other scientists. Personally he remained modest; his character did not change at all after the Nobel Prize.”Irwin Shapiro  the Timken University Professor  knew Glauber for more than six decades  first as a student and later as his colleague. He credits Glauber with ensuring that he got his first job after receiving his Ph.D.“He was only four years older than I  and he called the head of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory who was thinking of hiring me and suggested  with no uncertainty  that he do so ” Shapiro said.Though both had grown up in New York  they had never met before Shapiro became Glauber’s first doctoral student.“One anecdote that made him laugh when I told him was  when I first became his advisee in 1952  I told my mother about it and mentioned Roy’s name as my adviser ” Shapiro recalled. “She somehow mentioned it to her younger sister  who piped up and said  ‘Oh  Felicia’s little boy  Roy!’ I don’t know how my aunt knew Roy’s mother  but somehow they had been friends.”Glauber is survived by his son  Jeffrey  a daughter  Valerie Glauber Fleishman; a sister  Jacqueline Gordon; Rosett  his companion of 13 years; and five grandchildren.
Henry B. Reiling  HBS professor emeritus  dies at 80,Henry (Hank) B. Reiling  Harvard Business School’s Eli Goldston Professor of Business Administration Emeritus  and an authority in law  taxation  and finance whose extraordinary teaching abilities and course development had a profound impact on thousands of M.B.A. students and business leaders  died on Jan. 21 in Belmont  Mass. He was 80 years old.Reiling joined the Harvard Business School (HBS) faculty in 1976 and was appointed the first Goldston Professor in 1978. He retired in 2005 but remained active as a Baker Foundation Professor until 2012.Reiling taught finance in the School’s M.B.A. required curriculum and a number of elective M.B.A. courses  including the popular Tax Factors in Business Decisions. He co-designed and taught Leadership and Corporate Accountability (LCA)  the School’s first required course to examine the ethical  legal  and economic responsibilities of corporate leaders. It embodied a management philosophy shared deeply by Reiling  who encouraged his students to achieve success “with good judgment and the right way.”Reiling believed “that great leaders are motivated by their concern for other people  or by causes greater than themselves  and that our nation’s social problems will not get solved unless innovative businessmen  who sense a changing world and feel challenged  react in a fashion likely to produce profit  as well as imaginative response to social need.”“Hank Reiling was a gifted colleague who left an indelible mark on the School over four decades ” said HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. “Working closely with him on the development of LCA  I saw firsthand how he leveraged his expertise and experience to help students understand not just the legal issues business executives face  but also the ethical responsibilities and qualities of business leadership required in a constantly changing world. Hank was a beloved professor who guided and mentored generations of students. He also was a true gentleman scholar  who touched all who had the privilege of knowing and learning from him.”In addition to teaching M.B.A. students  Reiling was actively involved in the School’s executive offerings. For years he taught and chaired Finance for Senior Executives  and co-chaired Strategic Finance for Smaller Businesses. He also taught in the School’s program for international senior managers  held in Boston and Vevey  Switzerland.Reiling brought a unique set of interests to the School that reflected his multidisciplinary training in law and business. He had a wide and deep knowledge of the legal process and how it evolves and changes  and a keen understanding of tax issues and matters of corporate finance.His research focused on the intersection of law  accounting  and finance. He most recently studied the complex issues confronted by family businesses as their leadership transfers between generations.He is the co-author of “Business Law: Text and Cases” (1982) and articles in Harvard Business Review  Michigan Law Review  the Journal of Accountancy  and other leading journals. A prolific case writer  he produced dozens of HBS case studies  notes  and other teaching materials.Henry B. Reiling was born Feb. 5  1938 in Richmond  Ky. He spent his college years on Chicago’s North Shore at Northwestern University  where he received a degree in history. He went on to earn an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1962. He received a J.D. from Columbia in 1965.Prior to joining the HBS faculty  Reiling was a professor at Columbia Business School  where he won several distinguished teaching awards  and was a visiting professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business.A dapper man known for his immaculate dress and Southern charm  Reiling was widely admired and respected by students and faculty alike.With his aphoristic wit  he leavened even the most complex course material. “Hank communicated dense and at times dry subject matter clearly  simply  and with homespun charm ” recalls former student Sam Mencoff  M.B.A. ’81. “But what I remember most was not finance and tax theory  but Hank’s consistent emphasis on the importance of maintaining one’s ethical compass in business and in life ” adds Mencoff  who carried Reiling’s legacy of influence into his career. To honor Reiling  Mencoff and Greg Wendt  M.B.A. ’87  established the Professor Henry B. Reiling Fellowship Fund at the School in 2011. The fund held special meaning for Reiling  whose father died when he was 4 years old  and mother worked countless over time to pay for his and his sister’s higher education. “I’m sure there are many prospective HBS students today who will appreciate this fellowship as much as I did the financial support I received ” he said.Reiling’s lessons on life and leadership were published in the 2004 book “Remember Who Are: Life Stories that Inspire the Heart and Mind ” by Daisy Wademan  M.B.A. 2002  a collection of essays on personal leadership by 15 HBS faculty members.Reiling made many important contributions outside the classroom. He chaired a variety of University and professional committees  including Harvard’s Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibilities  and a Task Force of the American Bar Association  which effected a change in the federal taxation of stock purchase warrants.He co-founded a successful financial services company  and served as a director or advisory board member of more than a dozen for-profit (publicly traded and privately owned) companies and nonprofit organizations  including Northwestern University  where he was a trustee.After retiring from HBS  Reiling continued conducting research on family business succession while serving on several business  foundation  and educational institution boards  including the Board of Visitors of Northwestern University’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. For years  he was Northwestern’s Boston-area Regent.A long-time resident of Lexington  Mass.  Reiling is survived by his wife Carol and by children Christina R. Breiter  M.B.A. ’93  and her husband Hans C.R. Breiter; Maria H. Reiling  M.B.A. ’96  and her husband Reza Jamei; and Alexis Reiling Lessans and her husband Gregory P. Lessans; and nine grandchildren.Visiting hours will be Friday (Jan. 25) from 4 to 7 p.m. at Douglas Funeral Home  Lexington  Mass. The service will be held on Saturday at 1 p.m. Hancock Church in Lexington  with a reception to follow at the family house 28 Meriam St.  Lexington. In lieu of flowers the family has requested donations be sent to the Professor Henry B. Reiling Fellowship Fund  by mailing to HBS Development Operations  Soldiers Field  Boston  MA 02163.

Reflections on the ‘Queen of Soul’,Her sound was as singular as her name.Aretha Franklin defined the fusion of gospel and R&B known as soul music  singing about love  lust  and heartbreak with a woman’s wisdom at a time when the polished  G-rated cooing of Motown dominated pop airwaves in white America.An accomplished pianist as well  she was a chart-topping star who also championed traditional Gospel and political songs by African-American composers. She often worked with musicians whose top-flight talent was nonetheless overshadowed by her often-imitated  never duplicated voice.Franklin  who died Thursday at her home in Detroit from pancreatic cancer  was among the most important musical artists of the 20th century. She was 76.Crowned the “Queen of Soul” in 1967 just as she began to rack up a long string of hits for Atlantic Records — including “Think ” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman ” and “Chain of Fools” — Franklin more than lived up to that title during her six-decade career. A child prodigy  her outsized voice and piano playing brought her national attention even while touring in gospel revues with her musical father  the Rev. C.L. Franklin.Whether transforming Otis Redding’s macho entreaty “Respect” into an anthem of both black empowerment and feminist liberation  or reworking Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s polite supper-club fancy “I Say a Little Prayer” into a sultry exaltation  or leading a choir through gospel favorites and making the landmark “Amazing Grace” (her top-selling album)  she moved seamlessly among pop  R&B  gospel  and blues and with her distinctive phrasing seemedto make any song her own. She also was a skilled vocal arranger  often directing her own sisters  who sang background on those Atlantic classics like “I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You).”She won 18 Grammy awards  a Kennedy Center Honors  the National Medal of the Arts  induction into the Rock & Rock Hall of Fame  and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She performed for Presidents Jimmy Carter  Bill Clinton  and Barack Obama and sang at the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s funeral service in 1968.Harvard also recognized Franklin’s contributions  presenting her with an honorary Doctorate of Arts in 2014 during the 363rd Commencement. Dressed in her crimson robe  Franklin opened the Morning Exercises with a moving and memorable performance of the National Anthem  accompanying herself on the piano.The Gazette spoke with Harvard scholars and others about Franklin and her wide-ranging legacy. Here are their comments.
Remembering — and rereading — Stanley Cavell,Stanley Cavell was no ordinary philosopher  especially when he wrote.“The quality of his writing was rigorous  but also personal. He addressed the reader quite directly and  at times  intimately ” said Brian D. Young Professor of Philosophy Richard Moran  who recalled Cavell’s impact on him as an undergraduate — years before they would become friends and colleagues.“As a young person first discovering philosophy  you have to acquire the habit and the pleasure of rereading the texts  and continuing to learn from them. For me the richness and intensity of Cavell’s writing continually rewards that attention and was a major part of my education in philosophical reading. It is these same qualities that enabled Cavell’s writing to gain such a wide audience outside of academic philosophy.”Cavell  Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value Emeritus  died June 19 in Boston at 91. A faculty member for decades and a co-founder of the Harvard Film Archive  he published 18 books  including “Must We Mean What We Say? ” “Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage ” “The World Viewed ” “The Claim of Reason ” and “Disowning Knowledge.”“I first discovered Cavell’s writing in the 1970s  and his originality and range as a philosopher made a deep impression on me ” said Moran. “Today it is perhaps easy to forget or take for granted how pioneering he was. Academic philosophy has expanded and changed since the ’70s  but at the time there was hardly anyone writing across the gap between analytic and continental traditions  much less making movies  or Thoreau  or Shakespeare topics for serious philosophical reflection. He changed the possibilities of philosophical writing.”Born in Atlanta to Jewish immigrants  Cavell enrolled at the University of California  Berkeley  at age 16  graduating in 1947. A talented jazz pianist  he briefly attended the Juilliard School in New York before returning to the West Coast to take psychology and philosophy courses at UCLA. He completed his doctoral studies at Harvard and joined the faculty in 1963  as Civil Rights activism intensified on campuses nationwide. He taught in the Freedom Summer voting rights effort at Tougaloo College in Mississippi in 1964  and helped a student-driven campaign at Harvard to found the department of African-American studies.“At the time there was hardly anyone … making movies  or Thoreau  or Shakespeare topics for serious philosophical reflection. He changed the possibilities of philosophical writing.”— Richard Moran  Brian D. Young Professor of PhilosophyFilm was never far from Cavell’s mind  as he explained to a UC Berkeley interviewer in 2008.“What’s kept me going ” he said  “was the sense that it was not a question of why I was interested in film  but a question of why  since everyone is interested in film (one supposes throughout the world)  why don’t philosophers write about it? That was the question that  perhaps  more than anything  puzzled  bothered  even provoked me.”Along with film scholar Vlada Petric and documentarian Robert Gardner  Cavell co-founded the HFA in 1979.“Stanley so facilitated a pleasurably logical bridge across Quincy Street that connected the humanities in Harvard Yard to the then-new Carpenter Center ” said Steven Brown  a onetime Cavell student who now manages the archive’s box office. “The arts are integrated into the practice of teaching humanities much more deliberately now  but this was not such the case in the ’80s when I took his ‘Moral Perfectionism’ course.“In the Harvard Film Archive  cinema came into the classroom and vice versa. And it was done with such élan and without a whit of pretension.”
Former Overseer  HBS alum C.D. Spangler dies at 86,Harvard Business School alumnus and former member of the Board of Overseers C.D. (“Dick”) Spangler Jr.  M.B.A. ’56  died July 22 at his home in Charlotte  N.C. He was 86 years old.Extraordinarily accomplished in both the private and public sectors  after graduating from Harvard Business School (HBS) Spangler served two years in the U.S. Army. He went on to achieve great success in several industries  including his family’s construction business and banking  chairing the Bank of North Carolina during the 1980s and playing a key role in its merger with the North Carolina National Bank Corp.  now Bank of America. Spangler took great pride in recounting that while he was an M.B.A. student  his father was in the School’s Advanced Management Program.From 1998 to 2004  Spangler was a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and served as its president from 2003 to 2004.His devotion  generosity  and service to Harvard University and HBS were truly extraordinary. With his wife  Meredith Riggs Spangler  and two daughters  Anna Spangler Nelson  M.B.A. ’88  and Abigail Riggs Spangler  he gave amajor gift to the School that made the Spangler Center possible. An HBS professorship  held by William C. Kirby  also bears the family’s name: the Spangler Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.“Throughout his life and career  Dick Spangler epitomized the mission of Harvard Business School  making a difference in the world and in the lives of so many others — a kind and true gentleman whom we will always remember and admire and greatly miss ” said HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. “We were blessed to have him as our dear friend and benefactor for so many years and must continue to live up to the high standards he always expected of us. He will always hold a place of honor in the history of Harvard Business School and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know him.”Always willing to offer his advice and counsel  Spangler served on HBS’s Board of Dean’s Advisors from 1991 to 2011 and as anemeritusmember in more recent years. He was a member of the HBS Visiting Committee and its chair from 2001 to 2003. Spangler was co-chair of his 30th HBS reunion gift committee  and from 2002 to 2005 he chaired HBS’ previous Capital Campaign  an effort that raised some $600 million.In 1988  Spangler received HBS’s highest accolade  the Alumni Achievement Award. In 2005  the University honored him with the Harvard Medal  a special honor for alumni in appreciation of their many contributions to Harvard. He was the recipient of an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University in 2013.“Dick Spangler was an extraordinary leader who made a difference in multiple worlds ” added Kirby  Spangler Family Professor at Harvard Business School and T.M. Chang Professor of China Studies at Harvard University. “Successful in business  he became a major figure in American higher education. A proud Tar Heel devoted to his undergraduate alma mater  he was an exceptional president of the University of North Carolina. A loyal and generous alumnus of Harvard Business School  he had a transformative impact on our School and campus.“Dick was a man full of energy  optimism  and imagination. I came to know and admire him when I was dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences  and he was president of our Board of Overseers at a time that demanded real leadership in Harvard’s governing boards ” said Kirby. “We shared a common passion for China  among other things  and I had the great pleasure of traveling with him and Meredith on two memorable trips across China and Tibet. A more intrepid explorer I have never met  and we exchanged books and essays on China from that time on. After I joined the HBS faculty in 2008  I have been privileged to be the Spangler Family Professor of Business Administration. I can think of no greater honor.”With a lifelong passion for education  Spangler also oversaw the schooling of more than a million students as chair ofNorth Carolina’s Board of Education from 1982 to 1986. As president of the University of North Carolina  Chapel Hill  from 1986 to 1997  he increased enrollment and faculty funding while prioritizing educational quality and affordability.In addition to his wife and daughters  he is survived by a son-in-law  Thomas C. Nelson  M.B.A. ’88  and four grandchildren.In his honor and memory  the flags on HBS’s campus have been lowered to half-staff. Formore information  visit the HBS website.

Noted Harvard physicist Richard Wilson dies at 92,Richard “Dick” Wilson  Mallinckrodt Professor of PhysicsEmeritusat Harvard University  died on May 19 in Needham  Mass.Wilson will be remembered for his scientific work  student mentorship  principled humanitarian and environmental stands  and interdisciplinary connections across the globe. He was also a railway enthusiast  Morris dancer  concertina player  world traveler  and hiker.Born April 29  1926  in Putney  England  he studied at London’s Colet Court and St. Paul’s schools  evacuating to Crowthorne by bicycle during World War II. Wilson earned his B.A. and D.Phil. at Christ Church  Oxford. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for postdoctoral work in the U.S. at Rochester University and then Stanford University with Wolfgang “Pief” Panofsky. While at Stanford Wilson met Andrée Désirée DuMond  marrying her after a brief courtship.In 1952  the couple moved to Oxford University for Wilson’s research lecturer position  and in 1955 to Cambridge  Mass.  for a faculty position at Harvard.Wilson specialized in experimental particle physics  studying the nature of the smallest particles that constitute matter as they collide at very high velocities. He led the upgrade of Harvard’s proton cyclotron to 160 MeV in order to study nucleon-nucleon interactions. With Harvard and MIT colleagues  Wilson designed  constructed  and used the Cambridge Electron Accelerator 6 GeV synchrotron  which  from 1962 on  further probed nucleonic structure.Wilson was involved in constructing and using the new Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia  Ill.  frequently “commuting” there from Harvard  to maintain close contact with students and research. At Fermilab  Wilson continued the study of nucleonic structure with high-energy muon beams. When Harvard’s cyclotron became obsolete for particle research  Wilson helped adapt it for the treatment of cancerous tumors. He also studied electron-positron interactions with the CLEO collaboration at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring. Finally  Wilson joined a research group using the intense polarized beam of the new Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility in Virginia.Wilson went often to the USSR and Russia  believing that direct cultural and scientific contact was essential to prevent war. After the exile of dissident Soviet physicists  Wilson boycotted USSR conferences  and was an early and visible supporter of Andrei Sakharov. Wilson studied nuclear power safety and environmental carcinogens  such as asbestos. He visited Chernobyl after the nuclear accident  taking a PBS film crew with him. He studied arsenic in drinking water  and was especially proud of starting a program to provide safe  arsenic-free water from a village well in Bangladesh.Wilson authored 935 scholarly papers and eight books.Wilson and his wife lived in Newton for more than 50 years. Wilson is survived by his brother Geoffrey; his sisters-in-law Alison Wilson and Adèle Panofsky; his six children  A. Christopher (Rita McMahon)  Michael (Lisa Greenleaf)  Nicholas (Carol Anne Freeman)  Elaine (Brad Farnsworth)  André A. (Mary Frances Bond)  and Peter (Julie Whitmore); and three grandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife and his brothers Arthur and Laurence.A memorial service will be held at the Harvard Faculty Club at 20 Quincy St.  Cambridge  on June 24 at 1 p.m.  followed by a reception.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made in Wilson’s honor toAmerican Friends Service Committee Ingersoll Gender Center  or to theNewton Conservators Land Stewardship Fund. Condolences may be posted to the guestbook atwww.lehmanreen.com. Lehman Reen & McNamara Funeral Home  617.782.1000  Brighton  Mass.
Charles Slichter  longtime Corporation member  dies at 94,Charles Pence Slichter ’45-’46  A.M. ’47  Ph.D. ’49  an internationally known physicist who won the National Medal of Science and served for 25 years on the Harvard Corporation  including nearly 10 years as senior fellow  died Feb. 19. He was 94.Slichter  who long taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  was best known for his work on nuclear magnetic resonance and superconductivity. At Harvard  he served on the Corporation from 1970 to 1995  during what he called a “period of extraordinarily rapid change in higher education.” His tenure spanned the presidencies of Nathan Pusey  Derek Bok  and Neil Rudenstine  and he was the Corporation’s senior fellow for both the final years of President Bok’s tenure and the early years of President Rudenstine’s.  He chaired the University’s presidential search in 1990-91.“Charlie Slichter was a vital  energizing presence in Harvard’s governance for a full quarter of a century ” said Harvard President Drew Faust. “He was warm and wise in equal measure  and I know of few alumni who have devoted themselves so deeply to Harvard  its values  and its capacity to serve the world.”Past presidents also remembered Slichter with praise. Rudenstine called him “a rare human being and an outstanding senior fellow of Harvard’s Corporation — a brilliant academic with an intuitive understanding of universities and their fundamental purposes.“During my own years as president  he was for me an incisive and wise counselor as well as a friend and constant source of support ” Rudenstine said. “Harvard was more than fortunate to have had him  and those who knew him will always remember not only his dedication to the University but also the buoyant spirit with which he infused all that he undertook on Harvard’s behalf.”“Charlie Slichter embodied the very best  most loyal qualities of a Harvard alumnus ” said Bok. “He was a great support to all of us who served the institution with him. By his energy and enthusiasm for Harvard  he inspired those around him to work a bit longer and try a bit harder during the best as well as the most trying times.”The son of economist Sumner Slichter  a longtime Harvard professor who held the inaugural Lamont University Professorship  Slichter was the father of six children  including three sons who graduated from Harvard College.  He was also the grandson of University of Wisconsin applied mathematician Charles S. Slichter.Charles P. Slichter began his physics career while still an undergraduate  working as a research assistant during World War II at the Underwater Explosives Research Laboratory at Woods Hole  Mass.  which was directed by Harvard physicist E. Bright Wilson. After earning his Ph.D. at Harvard under the guidance of future Nobel laureate Edward M. Purcell  he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a physics instructor in 1949.  He was promoted to assistant professor two years later in 1951  to associate professor in 1954  and to full professor in 1955. At Urbana-Champaign  while training scores of doctoral and postdoctoral students  Slichter emerged as a pioneer in condensed matter physics and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Slichter was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2007 for establishing NMR as a tool to reveal the fundamental molecular properties of liquids and solids. The White House statement said  “His inspired teaching has led generations of physicists and chemists to develop a host of modern technologies in condensed matter physics  chemistry  biology and medicine.”“Charlie was a remarkable colleague  one of the last of the great physicists of the postwar generation ” said University of Illinois emeritus professor Gordon Baym. “He was always intellectually curious and remarkably wise. At the same time  he was a great human being  amazingly encouraging and supportive of his colleagues  students  and friends  whether young or old. Just seeing his warm smile would brighten everyone’s day.”A member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Philosophical Society  Slichter was recognized with numerous honors including the American Physical Society’s Langmuir Prize in Chemical Physics and Oliver E. Buckley Prize in Condensed Matter Physics  the International Society of Magnetic Resonance’s Triennial Prize  and the National Academy of Sciences’ Comstock Prize.  He also received the Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award (with H.S. Gutowsky and D.W. McCall) from the American Chemical Society.Slichter received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard in 1996.  The citation read: “An eminent physicist  revered teacher  and sage counselor who delights in his tasks; to the governance of the University he has brought humane reflection  scientific precision  and familial devotion.”  He also was awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Waterloo and the University of Leipzig.While fully dedicated to his research and the “Urbana style” of scientific exploration  Slichter maintained his close ties to Harvard for decades  culminating in his quarter-century on the Corporation. During the spring of 1961 he was the University’s Morris Loeb Lecturer in Physics  and the lessons he taught in those lectures formed the nucleus of his textbook  “Principles of Magnetic Resonance ” which served as the standard in the field for close to six decades. In 2005-06 he delivered Harvard’s David M. Lee Historical Lecture in Physics.“There was never a more dedicated son of Harvard than Charlie ” remembered D. Ronald Daniel  who served on the Corporation as Harvard’s treasurer from 1989 to 2004. “He was a member of the Corporation when it comprised seven people and met about 20 times a year. Charlie arrived faithfully from Champaign-Urbana on Sunday evening for just about every meeting for 25 years. That’s 500 trips and no nonstop flights. And his wisdom as well as his dedication were unmatched.”Slichter is survived by his wife  Anne FitzGerald Slichter ’71  HBS ’77-‘78; his children William  Jacob ’83  Ann  Daniel ’04  and David ’07; and five grandchildren.  He was predeceased by his son Sumner  and he is also survived by his first wife  Gertrude Thayer Almy  the mother of Sumner  William  Jacob  and Ann.
The human element: Remembering Calestous Juma,On their way to church on Sundays  the residents of Port Victoria  Kenya  would pass by young Calestous Juma’s house and drop off things that were broken — radios  record players  appliances. The 12-year-old had special dispensation from his priest to stay home and fix them. He was  the priest contended  “doing God’s work.”The scale of the broken things that Juma tried to fix grew considerably over the years  to range from agricultural to technological education in Africa to acceptance of new technology — as did the community of people who depended on his intellect and energy. This week  the global community mourned the passing of the leading voice among interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners working to harness science  technology  and policy in the service of sustainable well-being.Juma  who died Dec. 15 after a long illness  was a professor of the practice of international development at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) and director of the Belfer Center’s Science  Technology  and Globalization Project. He was 64.From colleagues at HKS to world leaders to his countless friends and followers  Juma was remembered for his towering contributions  as well as for his modesty and good humor.“I came to rely on Calestous’ invincible good spirits in all of our conversations about his own work and about the Kennedy School’s work regarding Africa ” said Douglas Elmendorf  dean of the Kennedy School and Don K. Price Professor of Public Policy. “For all of Calestous’ amazing accomplishments and contributions to the Kennedy School and to the world  he was always modest about what he had done and focused entirely on what he could do next. He was a true model for us all to aspire to. I will miss him very much  as I know so many of us will.”Archon Fung  academic dean and Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Citizenship at HKS  lauded Juma’s tireless work. “He warmed me with his humor and enlightened me with his wisdom ” Fung said. “He touched so many of us so often  and he will be greatly missed by all of us in the Kennedy School community.”Juma’s work varied in scale from the global to the very local. It was his studies on the interaction of biodiversity  biotechnology  and development that first brought him to international prominence  said his colleague Bill Clark  Harvey Brooks Professor of International Science  Public Policy  and Human Development. Juma’s influential book “The Gene Hunters” helped give rise to the U.N. Biodiversity Convention  and he served as the convention’s first executive director from 1995 to 1998.“For all of Calestous’ amazing accomplishments … he was always modest about what he had done and focused entirely on what he could do next.”— Douglas ElmendorfJuma co-chaired the African Union’s High Level Panel on Science  Technology  and Innovation  and pushed for the creation of a system of scientific and technical universities in Africa  and for the use of technology to improve the continent’s agricultural output.He also counted technical contributions among his achievements. Juma helped engineer a cook stove whose improved efficiency minimized the adverse health effects of indoor smoke. His experience with that process — users balked at the lack of smoke  which had helped them keep mosquitoes away — helped him understand the importance of “inclusive innovation.” (“We miss this human element all the time ” Juma said.)Juma was a science teacher and journalist before earning his doctorate in science and technology studies from the University of Sussex. He went on to found the first African nonprofit dedicated to the application of science and technology to sustainable development before joining HKS in 1999.“It was my initiative to bring Calestous to HKS  partnering with Bill Clark and Jeff Sachs  after I learned he was movable from the leadership of the Global Biodiversity Convention ” said John Holdren  Teresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy and former science adviser to President Barack Obama. “His passing is a shocking personal loss  as well as leaving a gaping hole in the global community of interdisciplinary scholar-practitioners in the domain of science and technology for sustainable well-being.At HKS Juma was affiliated with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs  the Center for International Development  and the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government. He also served as faculty chair of the executive-education programs “Innovation for Economic Development” and “Technology  Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Africa ” and had served as faculty chair for the Mason Fellows program.The recipient of a raft of prestigious prizes  including the 2017 Breakthrough Paradigm Award and the 2014 Lifetime Africa Achievement Prize  Juma served on the jury of theQueen Elizabeth Prize for Engineeringand the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation. He was a member of the Royal Society of London  the U.S. National Academy of Sciences  the World Academy of Sciences  the African Academy of Sciences  and the U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering  among others.Juma was a prolific writer  whose recent book was “Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies.” He was also a social media leader  with a huge following and a sideline in cartoons that poked fun at what he saw as obstacles to science and progress.“To ministers and heads of state  he was a sought-after adviser  pointing the way toward reforms that boosted farm yields  educational standards  and economic prosperity ” said Ash Carter  Belfer Professor of Technology and Global Affairs and director of the Belfer Center. “To the scientific community  he was an unstinting champion of innovation and rigorous evidence. To his students  he was a passionate teacher and mentor. To thousands of his fans on social media  he was a fount of insight  optimism  and good humor.“To us  he was a dear friend and extraordinary colleague.”Juma is survived by his wife  Alison  a son  Eric  and a sister  Nanjala.
Remembering Fred Glimp,Fred Lee Glimp Jr. ’50  Ph.D. ’64  whose nearly 50 years of service to Harvard left an indelible mark on generations of students  alumni  and the University itself  passed away in June at the age of 91.At a retirement celebration in 1996 honoring his decades of service to Harvard  buttons were distributed that read: “Be Like Fred.” It was a fitting sentiment for a man who was widely recognized for his kindness  generosity  and commitment to getting the best out of everyone around him.Born and raised in Boise  Idaho  Glimp joined the U.S. Army Air Corps after high school to fight in World War II. Upon completing his service he sent what he considered to be a long-shot application to Harvard College.His knowledge of Harvard at the time was based mainly on a copy of “Yankee From Olympus” his mother had sent him when he was overseas  which painted scenes of an idyllic campus in the time of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.  and an article in Life magazine that discussed the College’s challenge in dealing with an influx of servicemen. Glimp welcomed the challenge and later told The Crimson  “If [Harvard] was so hard to get into  it was worth trying.”He was accepted into the Class of 1950  arriving on campus for the first time in the fall of 1946. “I’d been out of high school for four years  so I was rusty ” he later told Harvard Magazine.With the assistance of the GI Bill  Glimp joined scores of veterans who were enrolling at Harvard at the time  creating a far more diverse student body on campus. Despite the rapid adjustment required  he enjoyed College life  played on the baseball team  and eventually excelled in his studies. He graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors andmagna cum laudedistinction on his economics thesis.Glimp then received a Fulbright Scholarship that allowed him to spend the following year in England studying at the University of Cambridge  after which he returned to Harvard to pursue a doctorate in economics.While studying at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences  Glimp sought out additional work. “I was sick of being on the dole ” he would jokingly explain to The Crimson.Wilbur Bender ’27  then the director of admissions and financial aid  was hiring and appreciated the perspective that Glimp brought to the table as a former serviceman. At first considering it a temporary job  Glimp spent the next six years under Bender’s tutelage  traveling the country to seek out candidates who would not normally consider Harvard College an option  and building a student body that was more diverse than ever.The work suited him  and Glimp soon assumed the role of director of freshmen scholarships  a position he held until Bender left Harvard in 1960  and Glimp was elevated to dean of admissions and financial aid.Over the next seven years — in addition to completing his Ph.D. in 1964 — Glimp built on Bender’s efforts to seek out talented applicants from all walks of life to create a more vibrant student body. During Glimp’s tenure as dean  the number of freshmen receiving scholarships increased from 25 percent to 40 percent  and the amount of aid more than doubled  from $1.2 million to $2.7 million.Glimp also sought out equally talented administrators. One of those was Jack Reardon ’60  who left a job working for Ed Logue at the Boston Redevelopment Authority to join the admissions staff in 1965 — a move that  like Glimp’s own  led to a lifelong career at Harvard.“Nobody made a bigger difference in my life than Fred. First  convincing me to work here  and then  being supportive of everything I wanted to do ” said Reardon  adding that he was one of many who would share that sentiment.In 1967  Glimp was named dean of Harvard College  succeeding John Monro. Those were turbulent years for the University. With opposition to the Vietnam War reaching a boiling point on college campuses across the country  Glimp had the daunting task of maintaining order at a time when many aspects of society were rapidly changing.He would later reflect that  “If one assumes that what happened to Harvard in the late 1960s was bound to happen in one serious degree or another  I would not trade the mixed experiences of those years for any other.”Memorabilia related to Fred Glimp  a former dean of Harvard College who recently passed away. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff PhotographerFormer University President Neil Rudenstine recalled at Glimp’s retirement  “In a turbulent time  [Fred] brought unfailing good sense  clarity  and steadiness of purpose  strong values  and human warmth to Harvard  when so many of these essential qualities were so often in such short supply in universities throughout the nation.”Glimp again replaced Bender in 1969  when he was named executive director of the Permanent Charity Fund (now known as the Boston Foundation) following Bender’s sudden death.The decade’s turmoil in education was not limited to college campuses. The Boston Public Schools were then failing to educate nearly 10 000 children  by one study’s account  due to “disabilities or lack of English language skills.”Glimp directed resources to nonprofits that worked successfully for state legislation addressing both obstacles. The Permanent Charity Fund also placed special emphasis on access to health care for city residents. During his tenure  Glimp helped with early funding for community health centers across Boston and made significant contributions to create what would later be named Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the Longwood Medical Area.Glimp found similarities in the work at Harvard and the Fund. “There are more good requests than there is money for  but there is also a clear case for ‘recruiting’ new proposals that would not otherwise be seen  which means more difficult decisions  more requests turned down  and a greater sense of having inadequate income for what can be done ” he would explain.After nearly 10 years at the Permanent Charity Fund  then-President Derek Bok asked Glimp to combine his expertise in University affairs and philanthropy by serving as vice president for Alumni Affairs and Development  a post he would hold for the next 18 years. Tom Reardon  who worked with Glimp in that department before succeeding him as vice president  said both he and the University were lucky.“Organizations take on the characteristics of their leaders and he set great expectations in a very humane way ” said Reardon. “Fred intoned a moral  ethical standard that permeated the office. He was a thoughtful  kind  tough-minded individual.”With his leadership on two capital campaigns — both record-setting efforts — and strengthening an increasingly global network of alumni  Glimp’s mark on the University will resonate for generations to come.Glimp credited his wife and children with his success. At his 25th College reunion  he said  “Life with my family has meant a great deal to me; subjectively  I care more about it than any other part of my life. I have always enjoyed having stress in my professional life  but I suspect that is so largely because of my extraordinary luck in having a daily life of mutual love and respect with my family.”Glimp is survived by his wife of 65 years  Eleanor “Buster” Foley ’48  four children  and 10 grandchildren.A memorial service will be held Sept. 9 at 2 p.m. at the Memorial Church “for Glimp’s friends  family  and colleagues to celebrate his remarkable life and remember the importance of striving to ‘Be Like Fred.’”
Albert Henrichs  professor of Greek literature  dies at 74,Albert Henrichs  a longtime Classics professor at Harvard  died on April 16. He was 74.The 10th Eliot Professor of Greek Literature  and the first to have been neither born in the United States nor educated at Harvard  he had been appointed with tenure at Harvard in 1973 when he was only 30 years old.Henrichs was born in Cologne  and rescued from the carpet-bombing there to spend his early years in Bad Ems. American GIs barracked in a nearby villa made him their mascot  spoiling the toddler with oranges and peanuts; Henrichs later attributed his affinity for the United States to those early memories. He earned his Ph.D. at Cologne in 1966  then spent two years working on the papyri collection at the University of Michigan before returning to Cologne for his Habilitation  the highest level of scholarly accreditation in Germany  and then moving to Berkeley  Calif.  in 1971.Henrichs’ most stunning coup was his discovery of a minuscule 192-page book  written in Greek in the fifth century A.D. Henrichs had carried the text — four lumps of ancient leather ― in a cigar box from Cologne to Vienna  where an expert conservator gradually unpeeled what turned out to be a sensation for the history of religion: a detailed tract about Manichaeism  a rival of Christianity  founded in Mesopotamia in the third century by a young mystic called Mani  whose autobiographical account of his divine revelations is quoted in the text.Henrichs was just 26. His subsequent publication of the codex with the papyrologist Ludwig Koenen established his reputation as aWunderkindof classical scholarship.Henrichs’ second coup was the translation and publication of 46 fragments from a second-century papyrus codex containing excerpts from a lurid Greek novel Phoinikika(“Phoenician Saga”)  by an otherwise unknown writer named Lollianos. The fragments followed the protagonist from the loss of his virginity to his participation in human sacrifice and cannibalism with a band of robbers in Egypt  with whom he consumes the heart of a murdered boy to seal his oath of allegiance to the gang.In the second half of the 20th century  study of classical Greek religion had focused on ritual. Henrichs brought it back to a focus on the gods  and what made them so: immortality  anthropomorphism  and power. He was world-renowned for his work on Dionysus  his favorite god  especially his role in Greek tragedy and his on-going reception to the present day.As a professor  Henrichs approached each text with the excitement of a student discovering it for the first time. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society  he taught until shortly before his death  stopping only when he could no longer reach Boylston Hall.Henrichs is survived by his wife  Sarah Nolan; his children by his first marriage  Markus and Helen; their mother  Ursula; and two grandchildren.Kathleen M. Coleman is the James Loeb Professor of the Classicsand director of Undergraduate Studies  Department of the Classics  Harvard University.
Remembering Mary Maples Dunn,Mary Maples Dunn  a historian and advocate for women’s education who presided over Radcliffe during its merger with Harvard  died on March 19. She was 85.“Mary always believed firmly in what women could do ” Harvard President Drew Faust said. “She made that clear both in what she said and in the model she represented.”An educator for more than four decades  Dunn arrived at Harvard in 1995  after serving a decade as president of Smith College. She had intended to retire from Smith  but her devotion to libraries and to building access for women led her to accept a position as head of theSchlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.That again was a likely last stop  but when Radcliffe tapped her to serve as interim president  Dunn rose to the occasion  steering the women’s college through its merger with Harvard and its transformation into an institute for advanced study that built on Radcliffe’s twin missions of academic excellence and commitment to women.“She was so widely liked and respected that she was kind of an emollient in the midst of the controversy surrounding the transition ” Faust said. “She was also hugely competent and a real leader who brought the institution forward.”Dunn was at the table as Radcliffe and Harvard ironed out a merger deal  taking on one of the most contentious issues of the negotiation: what to do with faculty appointments.“When news of the ‘merger’ between Radcliffe and Harvard was announced  I was excited and relieved to learn that Mary would be serving as acting dean ” Radcliffe Institute DeanLizabeth Cohensaid. “Mary was extremely well suited to take on this delicate role … She was smart as a whip and had intellectual and administrative gravitas as the former president of Smith College. But she also wore those qualities lightly and mixed them with a delicious sense of humor that disarmed potentially angry alums and endeared her to many of us.”Speaking to incoming freshmen in 1999  Dunn noted that the merger with Harvard was but one increment in Radcliffe’s history.“Metamorphosis is a useful metaphor for the transformation of Radcliffe ” she said. “A step that seems sudden … is actually part of an ongoing process.”The second of four children  Dunn was born in Sturgeon Bay  Wisc.  in 1931. She studied history in the early 1950s at the College of William and Mary  her sense of justice developing as the Civil Rights Movement spread across the South. Later  as a graduate student at Bryn Mawr  she was awakened to the possibilities of gender equality.“At first it seemed like an unreal kind of world … [but] I began to see how important it was ” Dunn told The Harvard Crimson in 1999. “I was in a place that was pretty much run by women and for women.”She earned her master’s and doctorate in history from Bryn Mawr  and then stayed on to teach  specializing in colonial America and the history of women  contributing to the transformation of women’s history into a field of scholarly importance.Dunn was president of the Berkshire Conference on the History of Women in 1974 when the group organized a session at Harvard that drew more than 2 000 historians and garnered a New York Times story headlined“The Woman in History Becomes Explosive Issue in the Present.”“She will be remembered for her stalwart  unfailing commitment to the educational needs of women  not just affluent daughters  but daughters of the not affluent ” saidPatricia Albjerg Graham  who was dean of the Radcliffe Institute in the 1970s  and then became Harvard’s first female dean  overseeing the Graduate School of Education from 1982 to 1991. “That characterized her work at Bryn Mawr  at Smith  and ultimately at Radcliffe.”Among Dunn’s students at Bryn Mawr was a young Faust  whom Dunn once described as an outstanding pupil  “the type of student you shape your teaching to.” The admiration was mutual; Faust says Dunn was “one of my absolute favorite teachers.”“She was just a great teacher ” Faust said. “She was jolly  energetic  smart  interesting  open. She was just great.”It was the beginning of what would turn into a decades-long friendship. Dunn and her husband  Richard  socialized often with Faust and her husband  Charles Rosenberg. Dunn was thrilled when Faust had a daughter  knitting her a baby blanket and telling Faust  “You’ll make her sane and Charles will make her interesting.”Faust believes it was Dunn who recommended her to then-Harvard PresidentNeil L. Rudenstineto lead the new Radcliffe Institute  and it was Dunn who urged Faust to come to Harvard. When Faust asked to delay assuming her responsibilities at Radcliffe for several months so that she could fulfill writing and teaching commitments  Dunn stayed on in an interim capacity without hesitation.“She just wanted to set it up in the best possible way to make me succeed ” Faust said. “I had my leadership tutorials watching her.”Dunn was an authority on William Penn  collaborating with her husband  a fellow historian  on scholarly projects  including editing the four-volume “Papers of William Penn.” After she departed Radcliffe  she and Richard served as co-executive officers of theAmerican Philosophical Societyin Philadelphia until 2007.“They enjoyed a long and very collaborative marriage ” Albjerg Graham said.Dunn was appointed dean of Bryn Mawr’s undergraduate college in 1978. In 1985 she was named Smith College’s eighth president  presiding over the school during a time of budgetary and racial turmoil.Upon her retirement in 1995  she said she hoped to be remembered more for the latter era; her administration created programs to promote inclusion and diversity  increasing the hiring of underrepresented minority faculty and the enrollment of minority students.“I would like to think that I had something to do with preparing the organization and the institution to live in a more diverse world than the one we used to inhabit ” she told the Smith Alumnae Quarterly.An enthusiastic cook  Dunn was entertaining friends at her home right up until the end of her life.“She loved being a hostess ” Rosenberg said. “And in some ways that skill served her well as an executive.”Dunn was named aRadcliffe Fellowin 2000. In 2001  the Radcliffe Association surprised her with the Radcliffe Medal.Expressing her gratitude for the honor  Dunn said  “I’m more grateful for the opportunity to build the bridges between Radcliffe and Harvard.”A memorial service will be held at Radcliffe Institute  Knafel Center  10 Garden St.  April 8 at 4 p.m.
Daniel Aaron  pioneer in American studies  dead at 103,Daniel Aaron  the Victor S. Thomas Professor of English and American LiteratureEmeritus died Saturday in Cambridge. He was 103.A pioneer in American studies and a prolific author  Aaron was also instrumental in founding theLibrary of Americacanon of classics.“Never have I known an intellectual and a great scholar who wore his learning so lightly  and with such capacity to delight ” said James Simpson  the Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Professor of English and chair of the English Department. “Conversation with him was utterly singular. He had the knack of negative capability to an extraordinary degree: immersing himself entirely  chameleon-like  in his interlocutor  while simultaneously and quietly impressing his own delightful stamp on any meeting. He has a place of deep affection in the hearts of everyone who was lucky enough to be touched by his angelic smile and singular intelligence.”The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants  Aaron was born Aug. 4  1912  and orphaned by age 10. As a Harvard graduate student in the late 1930s  he was the first to study in the program that would become American studies. In his 2007 memoir  “The Americanist ” he wrote of finding intellectual purpose through the lens of World War II.RelatedDaniel Aaron’s centuryLongtime Harvard professor  still working  turns 100“The United States suddenly loomed as the last democratic bastion in the world after the German occupation of France in 1940. About then  I began to feel that it might be almost as important to understand American civilization as to preserve it.”A man with a long  angular face and gentle blue eyes  Aaron taught at Smith College for 30 years  returning to Harvard as a member of the English Department faculty from 1971 to 1983.Helen Vendler  the Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor  had an office down the hall. The renowned poetry critic remembers Aaron’s office as “an American version of a salon — with Dan’s boyish presence being the catalyst for all visitors.”“As I would walk down the corridor  Dan was very often engaged with someone in lively conversation — friends  colleagues  students  people from China  Germany  and England ” Vendler said. “My granddaughter was so taken with him on an earlier visit that she returned to see him a month ago. When she told him she was originally thinking of applying to Yale as well as Harvard  he said dryly  ‘I never found anything particularly interesting about New Haven.’ He could — at 103 — chat as easily with a pre-freshman as with a colleague.”Aaron’s dedication to academic life was  Vendler said  evident in his daily journey to the office — “first by bike  then by foot  then with a walker  and then in a wheelchair.” He worked on an IBM Selectric typewriter and always answered the telephone on the first ring.Aaron’s “Writers on the Left: Episodes in American Literary Communism” (1995) has a home on every young academic’s bookshelf. “The Inman Diary: A Public and Private Confession” (1985) was a project born from the journals (17 million words’ worth) of Arthur Crew Inman  a reclusive hypochondriac who lived in Boston in the early 20th century. Harvard University Press reprinted “The Inman Diary” several times  and the book inspired a play  opera  and documentary.Among his friends were literary luminaries such as Robert Frost  Ralph Ellison  and Truman Capote. He graded John F. Kennedy’s literature papers and found his way into Smith grad Betty Friedan’s acknowledgements in “The Feminine Mystique.” He was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2011.Last summer  at 102  Aaron published “Commonplace Book  1934-2012.” The volume is filled with quotations  recollections  verse  and story plots. He enjoyed all topics of conversation  even death  which he wrote about on more than one occasion.“DA’s Obituary ” an acrostic penned in 1967  reads:Daniel AaronArrived August 4  1912Named after no one  in particularInvented nothing  except in wordsEven dispositionLoved a good deal and was lovedAnnounced early plans for old ageAssisted various and sundry studentsRetired at 65Once releasedNever heard of againAaron’s wife  the former Janet Summers  died in 2003. He is survived by three sons  Jonathan  Paul  and James; a granddaughter; and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at Harvard in the fall.

Stanley Hoffmann  Harvard professor and scholar  86,Stanley Hoffmann  the Paul and Catherine Buttenwieser University ProfessorEmeritusat Harvard University  died in Cambridge on Sept. 13 after a long illness. He was 86.The author of 19 books and countless articles for scholarly journals as well as leading newspapers and publications such as The New York Review of Books  Hoffmann had been a leading public intellectual on both sides of the Atlantic for more than 50 years. As a scholar of international relations and American foreign policy  as well as French and European politics  he left a deep mark on contemporary understanding of some of the most perplexing issues of our time. At Harvard  he was a brilliant lecturer and beloved teacher of a dazzling array of courses.Hoffmann was born in Vienna on Nov. 27  1928  to a distant American father and an Austrian mother  with whom he moved to France in the early 1930s. He grew up in France  attending schools in Nice and then Paris. Although he was baptized at birth as a Protestant  his mother’s family was classified as Jewish by the Nazis  and the two of them were forced to flee Paris in 1940  barely days before the German troops arrived. They went initially to a small village in the Languedoc and then to Nice  where they spent the war hiding from the Gestapo. In a memoir recalling those days  Hoffmann wrote: “It wasn’t I who chose to study world politics. World politics forced themselves on me at a very early age.”After graduating at the top of his class from the Institut d’Études Politiques (Sciences Po) in 1948  Hoffmann enrolled in a doctoral program in law there but came to Harvard in 1951 to pursue a master’s degree in government. He returned to France to complete his degree and military service but came back to Harvard in 1955 as an instructor in the Department of Government  where he received tenure in 1959. Prior to becoming a University Professor  he was the C. Douglas Dillion Professor of the Civilization of France. At the time of his retirement in 2013  Hoffmann had served on the Harvard faculty for 58 years  and his contributions to the University were prodigious. He was one of a small group of faculty members who founded the elite social studies concentration in 1960 and  for 25 years from 1969  he was the founding chairman of what became theMinda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.In essays and a series of striking books  including “The State of War” (dedicated in 1965 to his mentor Raymond Aron) and “Gulliver’s Troubles” (1968)  Hoffmann made major contributions to the modern study of international relations. Although attentive to the theories of that field  he resolutely avoided embracing any one of them  in favor of exploring the paradoxes posed by a world that would not readily fit into a single theoretical box. In much the same vein  Hoffmann was a sharp critic of American foreign policy  notably during the Vietnam War  drawing attention to the limits and obligations associated with American power. His 1981 book  “Duties Beyond Borders ” was instrumental to reviving the study of ethics in international relations.Throughout these years  Hoffmann was also a well-known intellectual figure across the Atlantic. “In Search of France ” based on a collective project he led and published in 1963  established his reputation as the most knowledgeable scholar of French politics outside the hexagon; and a series of essays published in “The European Sisyphus: Essays on Europe 1964-1994” displayed his gifts as a discerning analyst of the emerging European Union. A master of English as well as French prose  Hoffmann had deep insight into politics  literature  and political philosophy and a remarkable capacity for expressing all the subtlety of those insights with absolute clarity.These capabilities served him well in the classroom  where he taught widely across the curriculum  drawing thousands of students to his celebrated courses  even though their reading lists were formidable. When a few students complained that he had assigned all of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” instead of an excerpt as only one of the readings for one week of his course on war  Hoffmann is said to have replied  “Which part of ‘War and Peace’ summarizes the themes?” As a teacher  he demanded the best from his students  but he was utterly devoted to them  spending countless hours patiently guiding undergraduates and graduates alike through the complexities of the political world  alive to the practical and moral dilemmas within it. His hundreds of doctoral students include many of the leading scholars in their fields today.Hoffmann is survived by his wife  Inge Schneier Hoffmann of Cambridge  Mass.  whom he met when he was a teaching fellow for McGeorge Bundy’s course on American foreign policy in 1951-52 and whom he married in 1963.

David Grattan Hughes  88,David Hughes  Harvard’s Fanny Peabody Mason Professor of MusicEmeritus  died in Paris on April 20; he was 88.Born on June 14  1926  in Norwalk  Conn.  Hughes was a lifelong Harvard man. After his A.B. (summa cum laude  1949)  he served with the U.S. Army in Japan before returning to take his A.M. in 1954 and his Ph.D. in 1956  with a dissertation on music in the 14th century. He was appointed to the faculty in that year  and served until his retirement. He was chair of the department from 1961 to 1965; he served also as head tutor  advising generations of undergraduates  and as mentor for a series of distinguished dissertations. He taught also for many years in the Harvard Extension School.Masterly articles  dealing mainly with issues of transmission and filiation in medieval chant  especially in the area of tropes  established Hughes as an authority in his field. With John R. Bryden  he published “An Index to Gregorian Chant” (Harvard  1969); his textbook  “A History of European Music ” was published by McGraw-Hill in 1974.Hughes assumed the editorship of the Journal of the American Musicological Society in 1959. The journal had fallen behind in its publication  and it was vitally important to the society that it was brought back to regular publication. Hughes took it over  collected and edited a wide range of material  and oversaw a double issue for the summer/fall of 1959  marking the 25th anniversary of the founding of the society in 1934. This helped to put the publication back on its feet  and was a vitally important step in restoring the organization to good health and future prosperity. He was made an honorary member of the society in 2006.Hughes was a real polymath. There were few subjects in music on which he could not enrich and enliven a conversation; he was a fluent pianist  able to play almost anything from memory  vocal  instrumental  or orchestral. Students at Harvard remember his lively conversation  his challenging seminars  and his self-effacing sense of humor.Hughes lived in Belmont for many years  later retiring to coastal Maine; his annual trips to Paris combined research with rejuvenation. He was married to the former Janet Brandon  who died in 2007. He is survived by his daughters  Catherine E.C. Hughes of Charlotte  Vt.  and Anne Cox of Kew Gardens  N.Y.  and his son-in-law  Ian Cox.

He was a man of great compassion and kindness  who took great joy in helping whoever he could  however he could. We will all miss him greatly.”Read the fullobituary.
Rulan Chao Pian,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on February 3  2015  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Rulan Chao Pian was a true cosmopolitan  a woman who crossed boundaries with quiet courage and grace. Born in Cambridge  Massachusetts  during a period when her father  the Chinese linguist and composer Yuen Ren Chao  taught at Harvard  she spent most of her childhood in various cities in China as well as in Paris  returning to the U.S. at age 16. Pian received her B.A. (1944) and M.A. (1946)  both in Western music history  from Radcliffe College  and a Harvard Ph.D. (1960) in East Asian Languages and in Music.Pian’s career at Harvard reflected professional constraints confronting women of her generation. In 1947  during her graduate studies  she began work at Harvard as a Chinese language teaching fellow. In 1961  the year after receiving her Ph.D.  Pian was appointed as a lecturer in both the Departments of Music and East Asian Languages and Civilizations. Only in 1974 was she named a professor  one of the first women to attain this rank at Harvard.Early on Rulan Pian carried out historical research that provided the basis for her 1967 monograph  Sonq Dynasty Musical Sources and Their Interpretation. Noteworthy for its dual impact on musical scholarship and Chinese studies  this book received the Otto Kinkeldey Award from the American Musicological Society as the best scholarly book of the year. Pian carried out research and published articles on numerous subjects related to Chinese traditional music. She analyzed the workings of rhythm as well as the formal structures of Peking opera arias; unraveled the meaning of little-known musical notations from the distant past and transcribed the music into modern notational systems; documented genres of dance in Northeast China; and explored diversity and interrelationships among East Asian musics from a comparative perspective. Among her widely read later work was a reflexive essay titled “Return of the Native Ethnomusicologist” (1992). Pian also made important contributions well beyond the boundaries of musical studies: her 1961 textbook  A Syllabus for the Mandarin Primer  inspired many who were to become accomplished Sinologists  and Pian’s writings in general clarified the timbrel and melodic relationships between Chinese speech and song.In the 1960s Pian undertook ethnographic research on Peking Opera in Taiwan  later extending her purview to field sites in Mainland China. An unsung pioneer in the use of then new video technology  Pian recognized early on its potential for capturing ephemeral music and dance performances. She eventually compiled a collection of over five thousand original audio-visual recordings that she donated in 2009 to the library of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.In addition to her scholarly work and activity as a devoted teacher and mentor  in 1969 Pian founded the Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature (CHINOPERL) in collaboration with other Chinese scholars in North America. A charter member of the Association for Chinese Music Research founded in 1986  Pian served until the end of her life as an anchor for both organizations. Over the years she received many honors: she was named a Fellow of the Academia Sinica (Taiwan  1990)  awarded an Honorary Membership in the Society for Ethnomusicology (2004)  and received honorary professorships and fellowships across China  Taiwan  and Hong Kong.Pian is fondly remembered by all who knew her for having offered both scholarly guidance as well as exceptional hospitality. Her former students recall that her home was always open to them; several of their number lived in the Pian household for periods of time during their student years. Members of the Chinese academic community in Cambridge still transmit tales of the regular monthly meetings held over the years at the Pian home for discussion of Chinese music  literature  and culture  gatherings that came to be known as “New Dialogues in Cambridge” (Kangqiao Xinyu). Invariably  these events ended with the appearance of a large pot of red bean porridge (hongdou xifan) of which all partook. One can only surmise that this culinary tradition was inspired by Pian’s memories of her mother  food writer Buwei Yang Chao  whose book  How to Cook and Eat in Chinese  Rulan had edited and translated into English in collaboration with her father. It is said that this book introduced the terms “stir fry” and “pot sticker” into English.From 1975-1978 Rulan Pian and her husband  Theodore H. H. Pian  Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  served as Co-House Masters of South House (now Cabot House)  the first minorities to serve in this capacity at Harvard. Their portraits hang today in the Cabot House Senior Common Room. Following her retirement in 1992  Pian helped compile and edit her father’s complete works  the twenty-volume Zhao Yuanren Quanji (2002-). She also continued to be an active presence in the Music Department and elsewhere on campus  dropping by colleagues’ offices to chat  consulting sources in the library  and attending classes and lectures. Rulan Pian faithfully attended departmental events and regularly brought one of her legendary home-cooked Peking ducks to the Music Department holiday party table.Professor Rulan Chao Pian died on November 30  2013  at the age of 91  predeceased by her beloved husband  Ted  in 2009. She is survived by her daughter  Canta Chao-po Pian  and her son- in-law  Michael Lent  of Washington  D.C.; her grand- daughter  Jessica Lent of New York City; and by her three sisters  Nova Huang of Changsha  China  Lensey Namioka of Seattle  and Bella Chiu of Arlington  Massachusetts.Respectfully submitted Edwin A.

In memoriam: Dimitrios Trichopoulos  ‘giant’ in cancer epidemiology,Dimitrios Trichopoulos  who was Vincent L. Gregory Professor of Cancer Prevention and Professor of Epidemiology  and a past chair of the Department of Epidemiology  died on December 1  2014. He was 75.Dimitrios was an outstanding scientist and teacher for more than four decades in the field of cancer epidemiology and prevention. He published more than 1 000 scientific papers  continually staking out scientific frontiers — from seminal research linking secondhand smoke from cigarettes with an increased risk of lung cancer  and hepatitis B virus and tobacco smoking to increased risk of primary liver cancer  to findings documenting that surgically induced and early natural menopause reduced breast cancer risk. Outside of the field of cancer  his paper linking psychological stress after an earthquake in Athens to increased risk of cardiac death was included in a 1997 list inThe Lancetof 27 papers deserving to form a core canon of medical literature.Dimitrios’ research career included several significant “firsts”: He was first  with a 1990 paper inThe Lancet  to propose thatin uteroexposures play a major role in breast cancer causation. He also was first in 1981  along with an independent paper published a few days later  to report that secondhand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer. Along with Brian MacMahon  then chair of HSPH’s Department of Epidemiology  Dimitrios studied 51 nonsmoking women hospitalized with lung cancer in Greece  and compared them with age-matched women hospitalized for other problems. The researchers determined that the cancer patients were significantly more likely to have been exposed to their husband’s cigarettes.Read Full Story

He introduced measures to ensure that data from the trials were as free as possible of errors and biases — measures that are now standard practice. Zelen helped transform clinical trial research into a well-managed and statistically sophisticated branch of medical science. His work in this area led to significant medical advances  such as improved treatments for several different forms of cancer. His research also focused on improved early detection of cancer; on modeling the progression of cancer and its response to treatment; and on using statistical models to help determine optimal screening strategies for various common cancers  especially breast cancer.Born and raised in New York City  Zelen attended New York’s City College  where he became interested in statistics and probability. After college and a master’s degree in mathematical statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  he worked for 10 years at the mathematics lab of the National Bureau of Standards in Washington  D.C. He was the only one working in the lab without a doctorate  which he subsequently earned at American University in 1957.In the early 1960s Zelen spent two years as a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin’s Mathematics Research Center  where he first worked with cancer researchers  helping them address problems with study design. After that  for four years beginning in 1963  he led the National Cancer Institute’s applied mathematics and statistics section  where he delved further into cancer and clinical research. He spent a year in London as a Fulbright Scholar  and then joined the biostatistics department at the State University of New York in Buffalo.During his 10 years in Buffalo  Zelen helped the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) — one of several regional organizations established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to test experimental cancer therapies — with its studies. In an American University alumni magazine article in 2008  Zelen said those early studies were “terrible.” He said the studies were “poorly thought out; the data was wrong; they had poor quality control  not enough patients — everything you can think of that was antiscientific.”“Marvin had a lot of guts and a vision for what was important ” said Mitchell Gail  senior investigator in the biostatistics branch of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. “He finagled NCI into supporting the use of DEC-10 computers in clinical trials  long before the study section supported it. He inspired the clinical trials community of statisticians.”Zelen also played a key role in President Richard Nixon’s “war on cancer” in the early 1970s  serving as chair of a committee responsible for drafting the new program. His involvement in this endeavor was “tremendous and lasting ” according to Lee-Jen Wei  professor of biostatistics at HSPH.In the mid-1970s  Zelen’s pioneering work in Buffalo brought him to the attention of HSPH’s then-biostatistics chair  Frederick Mosteller. Zelen insisted that he would only come to Harvard if he could bring the team he’d built in Buffalo. In the end  27 faculty  researchers  and staff moved from Buffalo to Boston in 1977  along with a DEC-20 computer and the ECOG trials — 150 cancer trials involving several thousand patients. Zelen’s lab was established at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute  where  simultaneously with his tenure at HSPH  he built the cancer institute’s Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology.Zelen’s colleague  biostatistics professor Nan Laird  recalled that “those first few years of integrating 12 new faculty members from Buffalo with half as many from Harvard were part of Marvin’s grand plan to make Harvard the No. 1 biostatistics department in the country — which it is and has been for quite some time. It was an enormously exciting time when we were united in working towards a common goal. Marvin’s genius was that he got all of us involved  then stepped back and gave us all the credit.”Zelen is survived by his wife  Thelma; two daughters  Deborah and Sandy Zelen; and two grandsons  Matthew and Toby Mues. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. Zelen’s family will receive friends at their home  230 Eliot St.  Chestnut Hill  from 4 to 7 p.m.  through Nov. 21.

Nicolau Sevcenko dies at 61,Harvard Professor Nicolau Sevcenko  an international expert on Brazilian cultural history  died on Aug. 13 at his home in São Paulo. He was 61.“Nicolau was a great scholar and teacher  an extraordinary colleague  and a gentle and kind person. Our department will miss him dearly ” wrote Francesco Erspamer  interim chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures.Sevcenko was of Ukrainian descent but was born and raised in Brazil  a child of Soviet emigrés. After receiving his doctorate from the University of São Paulo (USP)  he quickly became a public intellectual figure; he published books and wrote extensively for newspapers and magazines  and his opinion was frequently sought on a variety of issues in Brazil.While having a long career teaching at USP  Sevcenko first came to Harvard — which he called “the intellectual crossroads of the world” — as a visiting professor in 2004-05. He joined the department as a full-time professor in 2009.Sevcenko was often recognized on the streets of Brazil and asked to comment on issues of public debate. He admitted in a2010 interviewwith the Harvard Gazette that he was enjoying his newfound anonymity in Cambridge  which allowed him to walk unimpeded all over the city.“Faculty members  staff members  and students in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures are deeply saddened. We still cannot believe that our dear colleague Nicolau Sevcenko will not be with us next term. We have been privileged to have him among us. We wish it could have been longer ” said Virginie Greene  professor of Romance languages and literatures and chair of the department during most of Sevcenko’s tenure with Harvard.Members of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures contributed to this obituary.
Hugh Calkins  former Overseer  Corporation member,Former Harvard Board of Overseers and Corporation member Hugh Calkins ’45  J.D. ’49  died at his home in Cleveland Heights  Ohio  on Aug  4.Calkins served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers from 1966 to 1968 and was a member of the Harvard Corporation from 1968 to 1985. Then-President Derek Bok awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1986 in recognition and appreciation of his two decades of service to the University.“Hugh was one of the three Corporation members who came to see me on a snowy night at the end of 1970 to offer me the presidency. He was certainly a model Corporation member ” Bok said.Henry Rosovsky  who succeeded Calkins on the Corporation  believes Calkins deserves credit for helping create a more open atmosphere for the Corporation across the University.“Hugh was on the Corporation during a very difficult time at Harvard: the 1960s. He was unique in that he extended himself to everyone and spent time with students  as a result of which he made the Corporation and other governing boards more visible. Considering Harvard’s traditions at the time  that was a tremendous service and one of his main achievements.”Born in Newton  Mass.  Calkins’ undergraduate years at Harvard were interrupted by service in the Air Force during World War II. He later attended Harvard Law School and was president of the Harvard Law Review.Following graduation he clerked for Justice Learned Hand of the New York Circuit Court and Justice Felix Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court before joining the Cleveland firm of Jones  Day  where he ultimately became senior partner and head of the firm’s tax division. Calkins was active in national legal circles throughout his career  most notably serving as deputy director of President Eisenhower’s Commission on National Goals.Calkins’ experience on the Goals Commission launched his longtime commitment to  and eventual second career in  education. He returned to Cleveland to found Plan for Action by Citizens for Education (PACE) and served on the Cleveland Board of Education from 1965 to 1969.Following his retirement from Jones  Day  Calkins earned a teaching certificate and devoted several years to teaching in inner-city schools in Cleveland. He also managed Initiatives in Urban Education (IUE)  a foundation organized for Calkins by his children that is dedicated to improving student achievement outcomes in Cleveland public schools. In that role  Calkins was instrumental in helping found Citizens Academy  a charter school near University Circle that has since gained recognition as one of the state’s highest-achieving charter schools.A September memorial service will be held in Ohio.

Woody Hastings  87,J. Woodland “Woody” Hastings  the Paul C. Mangelsdorf Professor of Natural SciencesEmeritusin Harvard’sDepartment of Molecular and Cellular Biology  passed away on Wednesday  according to his family. He was 87.Hastings was an expert on bioluminescence and one of the founders in the field of circadian biology. By studying a single-celled marine bioluminescent dinoflagellate  he detected the inner workings of circadian rhythms that  scientists increasingly realize  affect our lives as well. “Just think of jet lag ” Hastings suggested during an interview in 2010. In his research  Hastings also identified a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in colonial hydroids that is now standard in the biologist’s toolbox. Researchers who applied GFP as a reporter for gene expression won the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Hastings also discovered that bacteria can communicate with each other using a mechanism he called autoinduction  later dubbed quorum sensing  which has fundamentally changed the understanding of the microbial world.Hastings’ work has had relevance to naturalists  basic researchers  medical clinicians  industry  the human sleep lab  the child’s glow stick  and more  and earned him many awards and honors  including election to the National Academy of Sciences.Born in 1927 in Salisbury  Md.  at 10 Hastings became a choirboy at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York  where he attended its boarding school. The United States was in World War II when he graduated from Lenox School in Massachusetts in 1944  so he joined the Navy V12 medical officer-training program  which sent him to Swarthmore College.Instead of going to medical school when the war ended  Hastings finished his bachelor’s degree at Swarthmore  resigned from the Navy  taught biology (in French) at alycéein southern France  and worked on reconstruction in Germany. Returning  he completed a Ph.D. program in biology at Princeton University with E. Newton Harvey  who worked on bioluminescence; Hastings was hooked.Hastings joined the Harvard faculty in 1966  and it was here that he proved that luciferase  the light-emitting enzyme  and luciferin  its substrate  are synthesized and destroyed daily  not just activated or inhibited  and so is the entire cellular organelle called a scintillon that houses these proteins. Carl Johnson  who worked on this project as a postdoc from 1982 to 1987  recalled that they had trouble convincing reviewers to publish this work. “It was the first demonstration of any circadian rhythm of protein synthesis. Now  it’s commonplace knowledge that many proteins exhibit these rhythms.”Johnson was one of “many very bright people who were attracted to Hastings’ manner of directing research — a free exchange of ideas without daily supervision ” said Thérèse Wilson  a senior research associate who joined Hastings’ lab in 1969 and conducted independent research on photochemistry. She also co-authored many papers and later a book with Hastings. “He lets people blossom.”Hastings’ influence on young people went beyond his lab and classrooms  and his own four children. For 20 years  from 1976 to 1996  he and his late wife of 56 years  Hanna  were much acclaimed “co-masters of the Universe” at North House (now Pforzheimer)  the smallest and some said the most intimate House at Harvard.A private memorial service will be held in October.
Marc J. Roberts  71,Marc J. Roberts  a longtime professor at theHarvard School of Public Health(HSPH) whose former students run health systems across the country and around the world  died suddenly Saturday night at his home in Cape Cod  Mass. His death  apparently from a pulmonary embolism  was confirmed by his partner Mary Ann Stevenson  chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. He was 71.Roberts retired from Harvard in 2013 but continued a vigorous consulting practice  traveling widely and teaching public officials how to set up efficient health-delivery structures. At his death he was planning an extensive fall teaching tour to Turkey  South Africa  and Spain.While Roberts was the author or co-author of seven books and numerous articles on health policy  perhaps his biggest impact came through his students. Many remained deeply devoted to him throughout their careers and often invited him to visit their home countries and train the next generation of health officials and experts.HSPH held a symposium in March 2013 honoring Roberts at his retirement. One of the speakers  Karl Lauterbach  a former doctoral student who now serves in the German Bundestag  said: “A lot of what I currently do is inspired by Marc. I have had many brilliant teachers. The best teacher of all teachers I’ve had is Marc. There is no one I have learned more from than him. We did not always agree on issues  but he taught mehowto think  notwhatto think.”Roberts’ most important book  “Getting Health Reform Right: A Guide to Improving Performance and Equity” (Oxford University Press  2004)  has become a classic in the field of global health and has been translated into five languages  including Chinese and Arabic. One of his co-authors  Michael R. Reich  recalled: “Marc excelled at engaging these health leaders at multiple levels — intellectual  personal  ethical  and political. Through his case teaching style  his stories  and his humor  he gave them nuggets of wisdom that they could take home and use in solving their most difficult policy problems. His loss is literally being felt around the world.”Roberts was born on Feb. 11  1943  in Bayonne  N.J. His grandparents fled the anti-Semitic pogroms of Eastern Europe and settled in Bayonne  an industrial town across the Hudson River from New York City. His father  Will Roberts  was a writer and publisher of children’s books; his mother  Dorothy Schanbam Roberts  was a homemaker. He graduated from Bayonne High School with top honors and was elected governor of New Jersey Boys State.Roberts arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1960 as a freshman  and except for a year as a Fulbright Scholar in England  and a semester as a visiting professor at Stanford  he never left. He graduatedsumma cum laudein 1964 with an A.B. in social studies  and completed his Ph.D. in economics in 1969. He taught in the economics department until 1975  when he was named professor of political economy and health policy at HSPH.His interests ranged widely and he taught courses in economics and ethics  environmental and health policy. In 1990 he pioneered the development of a new required course in ethics and public policy — a first for any public health school in the country. His classroom style — challenging and forceful  often laced with humor and an occasional profanity — was “legendary” according to Reich. “Students viewed the world differently after a public-health course with Professor Roberts ” he said.Roberts was always interested in solving real-world problems  not spinning abstract theories. That led him to serve as an economic adviser to several presidential candidates  including Michael Dukakis and Edward Kennedy. Both men lost and Roberts never served in Washington  but he satisfied his calling to public service on the international stage.Working with the World Bank Institute and several colleagues from Harvard  Roberts helped develop what was called the Flagship Course on Health Sector Reform and Sustainable Financing. Starting in the late 1990s  more than 20 000 health professionals from over 30 countries have taken the course. One of his focal points was Egypt  which he visited many times in recent years to help improve the public hospital system in that country.Hadia Samaha  one of his teaching colleagues  wrote from the Congo: “I had the pleasure and honor of working with Marc for more than 10 years  traveling the world with him and witnessing how he would captivate his audience  doing what he lived to do most: teaching.”Roberts is survived by four children: Jenna Mammen of Baltimore; Justine Roberts of Lee  N.H.; Clement Roberts of San Francisco; and Zaq Roberts of Santa Cruz  Calif.; two stepchildren  Roxanne Calderwood and Alexander Calderwood of Chestnut Hill  Mass.; eight grandchildren; and three siblings  Steven V. Roberts of Bethesda  Md.  Glenn E. Roberts of Garrett Park  Md.  and Laura B. Roberts of Cambridge  Mass.Stevenson will be receiving friends at their home  130 Lagrange St in Chestnut Hill  from 5-8 p.m. on Tuesday  Wednesday  and Thursday. A memorial service at Harvard will be held in the fall. A fund is being established to create a prize in Roberts’ name  to be awarded to an outstanding doctoral candidate at HSPH. Contributions to the Marc J. Roberts Financial Aid Fund can be sent to the Harvard School of Public Health  90 Smith St.  Boston MA 02120. For questions and inquiries  call 617.432.8076.

He put his graduate studies on hold to serve in the Pacific Theater with the U.S. Navy during World War II.A former director of the Fogg Art Museum  Slive understood the brilliance of 17th-century Dutch masters such as Rembrandt  Frans Hals  and Jacob van Ruisdael  and the importance of their rich landscapes and evocative portraits.Among Slive’s publications are “Rembrandt and His Critics: 1630-1730” (1953)  “The Rembrandt Bible” (1959)  “Frans Hals” (three volumes  1970-74)  “Jacob van Ruisdael: A Complete Catalogue of His Paintings  Etchings  and Drawings” (2001)  and “Rembrandt Drawings” (2009).Before his arrival at Harvard in 1954  Slive taught at Oberlin College in Ohio and later at Pomona College in California  where he was assistant professor of art and chairman of the department. Slive became an associate professor at Harvard in 1957 and a fine arts professor in 1961. He was appointed chairman of the Department of Fine Arts in 1968 and served in that position until 1971. In 1973  Slive was appointed Gleason Professor of Fine Arts at Harvard. He was the director of the Fogg Art Museum from 1975 until 1982.During his directorship  Slive helped establish the Arthur M. Sackler Museum to house Harvard’s collections of ancient  Asian  Islamic  and (later) Indian art in 1985. During his career  Slive was also an exchange professor at the University of Leningrad (1961) and Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Oxford (1972-73.)

Nobel laureate Hubel dies at 87,Harvard Medical School Professor David H. Hubel  whose discoveries in visual processing and development ushered in the modern study of the cerebral cortex and changed the way childhood cataracts and strabismus (“cross-eye”) were treated  died on Sept. 22 of kidney failure in Lincoln  Mass. He was 87.Hubel  the John Enders Professor of Neurobiology Emeritus and longtime research partner Torsten Wiesel shared half of the 1981 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their groundbreaking insights into the structure and function of the visual cortex and the importance of exposure to certain visual stimuli shortly after birth for normal vision development. (The other half of that year’s prize went to Roger Sperry for finding that the two hemispheres of the brain have specialized functions.)“David was one of the great scientists of his generation ” said Michael Greenberg  Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology and chair of the Department of Neurobiology at HMS. “His work revealed how the brain is organized to produce visual perception. The insights we have gained from his discoveries resonate to all aspects of sensory perception. Not only were his experimental findings revolutionary  David was also a passionate teacher and a talented communicator. Everyone in the field of neurobiology has been inspired by his achievements.”A memorial service will be held at the Memorial Church on Nov. 16 at 2 p.m. Interment will take place at a later date at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. The HMS Department of Neurobiology will hold a celebration of Professor Hubel’s scientific achievements next spring.Memorial donations may be made to a newly establishedHubel Memorial Fund.To read thefull obituary visit the HMS website.
David S. Landes  89  dies,David S. Landes  a renowned historian whose work focused on the complex dynamics of cultural values  technological innovation  and historical circumstance in economic development  died Aug. 17 at age 89.The Coolidge Professor of History and Professor of EconomicsEmeritus  Landes is arguably best-known for his book “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations ” a historical treatise that explored the ways in which history and culture intersected to create the conditions that allowed some nations to prosper while others languished in relative poverty. The book has been hailed as a landmark work by other historians and economists  including John Kenneth Galbraith  who called it “truly wonderful. No question that this will establish David Landes as preeminent in his field and in his time.”Citing examples as varied as the role air conditioning played in the development of the American south  to how using chopsticks may have helped Asian workers gain the manual dexterity needed in microprocessor manufacture  to the role of eyeglasses in making precision tools possible  Landes was able to illustrate the modern history and economics of Western Europe and the Middle East in a unique and highly accessible way.Among the Harvard faculty members who worked with Landes was Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History Niall Ferguson  who received a lengthy message from Landes regarding an upcoming book.“I had just finished the first draft of my history of the Rothschilds ” Ferguson recalled. “I returned from holiday to find a 95-page fax from David Landes  who had been asked to act as a reader  but in fact took on the role of my unofficial editor.“His comments were so brilliant  so insightful and so helpful that I was humbled ” he continued. “It was the beginning of a friendship  but I always considered myself first and foremost his apprentice-cum-disciple  always learning from a master of economic history — and of life. ‘Other people work to live ’ he liked to remind me. ‘We are lucky — we live to work.’ ”Another Harvard faculty member who counted Landes among his role models was Alan Dershowitz  the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.“David was a role model for me from my earliest days at Harvard — showing me that a Harvard professor could be a proud Jew and Zionist ” Dershowitz wrote. “It was an honor to know him and be a neighbor. I remember particularly his active involvement in the Harvard Jewish faculty lunch group and the perceptive and challenging questions he always posed. I will miss him.”“What melancholy news ” said Leon Wieseltier  literary editor of theNew Republic. “I remember David as one of the most interesting people I ever knew  and in so many ways unexpected: a traditionalist who kept inventing new subjects; an economic historian who taught everyone to study culture; a sophisticated man who liked to defend common sense.“He had a naturally rigorous mind  which people sometimes mistook for a ferocity of personality ” Wieseltier added. “I don’t think I ever had a conversation with him that did not impart a new fact or refine an old opinion.”Born in Brooklyn  N.Y.  Landes received an A.B. from the City College of New York in 1942  and his A.M. from Harvard University in 1943.After receiving his master’s degree  Landes was inducted into the U.S. Army  and assigned to the Signal Corps  which deployed him to guard and sentinel duty at the Army Japanese language school in Arlington  Va. While there  he met Edwin Reischauer  then an instructor at Harvard in Far Eastern languages.Drawn by Landes’ personality  Reischauer selected Landes for the Signal Corps’ Japanese language school  where he worked as a cryptanalyst of Japanese codes. In May 1944  Landes received a field promotion to second lieutenant  as a cryptographic officer. In part  he deciphered Japanese messages concerning the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. In 1945 and portions of 1946  he served in Hoechst  Germany  as a historical editor of German preparations for the defense of Normandy.Following his honorable discharge in 1946  Landes returned to Harvard  where he studied under Professor Donald McKay  and received his Ph.D. in 1953. From 1950 to 1953  he was a junior fellow of the Society of Fellows at Columbia University  and was appointed an assistant professor at Columbia in 1952; he later served as an associate professor from 1955 to 1958.From 1957 to 1958  Landes served as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. He was then appointed a professor of history and economics at the University of California  Berkeley  a post he held until 1964.In 1964  he joined the Harvard faculty as a professor of history and went on to various appointments in the fields of history  political science  and economics. From 1981 to 1993  he chaired the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies  and since 1987 he had been a senior fellow of the Society of Fellows.In addition to his work as a Harvard faculty member  Landes in 1975 led a panel on Western European affairs for the Commission of Critical Choices for Americans  which was created by former New York Gov.

Heaney’s death caught ‘the heart off guard’,When a famed poet dies  words come tumbling to mind.For the many members of the Harvard community who knew Irish poetSeamus Heaney  the 1995 Nobel laureate in literature who died Friday  the news of his death mirrored his description of a fine poem: “It catches the heart off guard.”Critics often called Heaney  who died in Ireland at 74  the finest Irish poet since William Butler Yeats. He began teaching at Harvard as a visiting professor in 1979  was elected the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory (1984-95)  and then eased into a final Harvard rhythm as the Ralph Waldo Emerson Poet-in-Residence  a post he held until 2006.During all of his part-time residences at Harvard  he lived in Adams House. “The arts and bohemia were represented there ” he said in a trans-Atlantic interview with the Harvard Gazette last year. “It was a desired address.”In 1998  Harvard gave Heaney an honorary degree. The citation  summing up the poet’s life  read: “Amid history’s blood-dimmed tide  risen from the dank sod of memory and silence  his resonant verse reminds us that ‘the end of art is peace.’ ”“We are fortunate and proud to have counted Seamus Heaney as a revered member of the Harvard family ” said Harvard President Drew Faust.  “For us  as for people around the world  he epitomized the poet as a wellspring of humane insight and artful imagination  subtle wisdom and shining grace.”PoetJorie Graham  the current Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory  said in an email: “When death takes one of their great poets  an event which happens only a few times in a century to any given people  in any given language  there is always a terrifying silence that follows. Who will sing our soil  our inner secrets  our history  our transactions between those two  our loves? One lives to feel the passing of such a voice rarely  maybe once in a lifetime  and today is one of those days for so many humans on this earth.”Heaney’s longtime friend  collaborator  and colleagueHelen Vendler  Harvard’s A. Kingsley Porter University Professor  introduced the Northern Ireland native at a 2008 reading as “a poet of the century  and the new century  but also a poet of Harvard.”Heaney’s last official appearance at Harvard was in May 2012. At Morning Exercises  in honor of the University’s 375th year  he reprised his 1986“Villanelle for an Anniversary ”composed for the University’s 350th.In her tribute  Faust recalled that “inimitable villanelle” and said it will “forever remain one of the most eloquent evocations of what our University is and aspires to be  with our books open and our gates unbarred.”The demanding 19-line poetic form relies on the rhetorical power of repetition  in this case  alternate rhyming refrains lifted from the first stanza. “There’s a kind of bell-ringing quality to the villanelle ” said Heaney told the Gazette last year  “which makes it easy on the ear.”Soundbytes: Anatomy of a villanelleIn an interview last year  Seamus Heaney reflected on writing a villanelle to mark Harvard’s 350th anniversary in 1986. “There’s a performance element to it ” he said of the songlike poetic form of 19 lines used brilliantly by Dylan Thomas  Elizabeth Bishop  and just a few others. Read it too smooth and it sounds “pat ” said Heaney  who reprised the poem at Harvard in 2012. Read it too rough and “it sounds galumphing along.”Harvard English professor  essayist  and poetry criticStephen Burtwrote in an email that the death is “an inestimable loss for his friends  for his students and former students  for Harvard  for Ireland  for the many readers all over the world that his work has attracted (and rewarded  and deserved)  and for the history of poetry in the English language  in whose achievements  transformations and delights he played a great part.”Burt praised Heaney’s deep-feeling style  saying  “He wrote with gravity  and with care  and with attention to his own place of origins; he also wrote with verve  with pleasure  with elaboration  on his own frequency  which became one of ours.”David N. Hempton  dean of the Harvard Divinity School and a fellow native of Northern Ireland  crossed paths with Heaney in 1970 at Queen’s University in Belfast  where the poet was a young lecturer in the English Department and Hempton was a freshman.“It was an obviously tremendous shock ” he said of Heaney’s death  “though I knew he had been unwell.” In January  the Divinity School had invited Heaney to deliver this fall’s Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality  a tradition since 1896. “He sent me one of the world’s great ‘No’ letters ” said Hempton. “It was almost a joy to read the letter  despite the rejection.”During the 1970s and 1980s  Hempton said  people in Ireland “north and south were reading his poems ” a unifying Irish literary experience despite the era’s sectarian strife. “It was quite evident to all of us that he was … a poet of extraordinary distinction.” Heaney had a magical grasp of the language  a “realism united to hope ” said Hempton  that was free of pretension and inspired by Ireland’s landscape and language. “He was always the son of his rural parents.”The poet  born in a County Derry farmhouse  also thrived as a translator and playwright. As a translator  his 2000 rendering of “Beowulf” combined the music of Anglo-Saxon influences and modern English. It won the Whitbread Book of the Year award.“Heaney was necessary to people speaking his language — a language which he  more than anyone  traced back to its living roots in Gaelic  Anglo-Saxon  Latin  Greek  though never losing its local inflection ” said Graham. “That he was also necessary to people speaking so many other languages  on this beautiful and war-torn and lonely planet  is a testament to the universality of his soul’s singing.”From 1973 to 1999 Robert Kielywas master at Adams House  Heaney’s Harvard home. (Kiely is now Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Professor of EnglishEmeritus.) “I can never forget his coming to live in a very modest guest suite in Adams House when he was a quite young  esteemed  but not yet world famous  poet ” Kiely recalled in an email. “Guests of the Harvard Houses often take a room  but never show up for anything.  That was not Seamus.  He had meals in the dining room with students  gave formal and informal readings  taught classes  and  best of all  brought Irish friends  musicians  to our annual St Patrick’s Day teas and recited poetry while standing on a chair while I (before the rules tightened) bartended black-and-tans in the master’s study of Apthorp House.”Heaney also set a new standard  remembered Kiely. “As a student  I thought poets had to be odd and neurotic  which was true enough of many of the American poets of my generation ” he said. “But Seamus — God bless him — was a sane as well as a greatly gifted  kindly  good-humored  and modest man.”Every semester-long visit began the same way  Heaney recalled last year: “Go straight to Adams House  set up  and then go straight to the bookshops.” After that  he always stopped at One Potato  Two Potato  a long-gone restaurant on Massachusetts Avenue.Heaney fondly recalled the material Harvard  and its resonances  including the Yard  which lent him a sense of his own boyhood on a farm. There was also “the excitement of driving along Storrow Drive and seeing the outlines of the Houses  which was a kind of moment I would remember always.”Some evenings  Heaney said  he would slip away to smoke a cigar outside Apthorp House. He enjoyed other quiet corners at Harvard too  including the library at Adams House and the Woodberry Poetry Room at Lamont Library. “It was quite easy to sit down ” said Heaney  “and doze off  even.”He remembered writing just two poems during all his years at Harvard  intervals that were more full of teaching  reading  and poetry readings than the business of writing poems. “I tended to regard the Harvard stint as a kind of executive moment in life ” said Heaney. “Your public self was on.”He felt a tenderness for Harvard  remembered Kiely. “On the day he heard he was awarded the Nobel Prize  he phoned us (before cellphones) because he said he was too happy to keep the news to himself ” Kiely recalled. “I took the call during one of our teas and announced it to storms of Adamsian applause.  I think we all really loved him.”Heaney’s two compositions while at Harvard were the anniversary villanelle and “Alphabets ” which was written for the Phi Beta Kappa Literary Exercises in 1984. “Traditionally the Phi Beta Kappa poem is about learning ” Heaney said. “So mine was [about] making the first letters at primary school.”An early line starts: “There he draws smoke with chalk the whole first week / Then draws the forked stick that they call a Y. / This is writing.”“Alphabets” is a tribute to reverie  childhood  longing  and to the graduated nature of learning. Over time  letters on a slate become boyhood Latin and then a poet’s alphabet of a “new calligraphy that felt like home.” The poem continued: “The letters of this alphabet were trees. / The capitals were orchards in full bloom  / The lines of script like briars coiled in ditches.”During his second-last reading at Harvard  in 2008  Heaney reflected on the anniversary poem  which he had read to a crowd of 20 000 in 1986. The repeating lines made the villanelle handy for reading over loudspeakers  he said  since  “If you’re going to read a poem in the open air  over large speakers  to large crowds  make sure it’s very clear.”Over the years  Heaney’s readings at Harvard and elsewhere were so wildly popular that his fans were called “Heaneyboppers.”A world of them now mourns.“Today many will pick up his books to hear him momentarily again ” said Graham. “He will give them back the depth of their being  awaken their sprits  quicken their hearts. He will awaken them to the complexity of existence  the mystery of mortality  and help them take the measure of the heartbreaking conflicts and confusions of history without ever losing the sense of the horizon at which history and poetry may rhyme. And then he will be read down the centuries as long as there are readers.“As for the man  so many people will miss him desperately in what they will feel is an intimate way  as he was an astonishing friend ” she added. “Rare indeed is the man about whom it can be said that the greatness of his soul is matched by its goodness. It is a sad day indeed when his early words ‘between my finger and my thumb  the squat pen rests’ take on their late meaning. His words will not rest.”Burt added  “He will be read and re-read. And he will be missed.”
Elizabeth Jones  94  former conservator at Fogg,Elizabeth H. Jones  former head of conservation at the Fogg Museum  died on May 20 in Woodbury  Conn. She was 94.Known to friends and colleagues as Betty  she earned a degree in fine arts from Vassar College in 1940 and studied painting at the Art Students League of New York for two years before joining the World War II effort in the drafting department of Pratt & Whitney in Hartford.Jones came to conservation after the war  apprenticing with art conservator Caroline Keck  while studying chemistry at New York University. She received her master’s degree in fine arts from Radcliffe College in 1948 and immediately began working in the Conservation Department of the Fogg Museum. In 1951  she directed a National Parks Service restoration project at Independence Hall in Philadelphia and later the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Jones returned to Harvard in 1952 and served 22 years as head of the Conservation Department and “keeper of silver” of the Harvard Art Museums. During that period she also held a lectureship in the Harvard Fine Arts Department.After an early retirement in 1974  she was called back to Boston in 1975 to serve as chief conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts. She was a fellow of the International Institute for Conservation (IIC) and the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) and served as vice chairwoman of the AIC in the early 1960s.Beginning in 1967 Jones devoted many months to the preservation and restoration of paintings  sculptures  and structures that were ravaged by floods in Venice  Italy. Working under the auspices of the Committee to Rescue Italian Art (CRIA)  she spent the summers of 1969  1971  and 1972 in Venice. During the academic year  when she was based in Cambridge  Mass.  she participated in a number of events to raise funds for CRIA.

Coach for the ages,Legendary crew coachHarry Parker  who joined Harvard in 1960 and helmed theCrimson’s heavyweight programstarting 50 years ago  died Tuesday. He was 77 and had mentored generations of Harvard rowers and U.S. Olympians.“Generations of Harvard students will forever remember his formative influence ” said Harvard President Drew Faust of Parker. “He was a living legend at Harvard and in the world of rowing  and his legend will long endure.”In the decades he coached  Parker’s crews powered their way to 22 undefeated regular seasons  16 national championships (official and unofficial)  and a 44-7 record over Yale in the traditional Harvard-Yale Regatta. It was in June of 1963 when the 27-year-old Parker — the freshman coach who became interim varsity coach that January — coached an underdog heavyweight squad to an unlikely eight-boat-length victory over Yale. It opened a winning streak against Yale that went unbroken until 1981. He closed out his career at Harvard with six consecutive victories in the same annual contest.Parker  a man of few words but of telling words  observed simply  “I vastly prefer winning to losing.”He had fallen in love with rowing as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania  where he combined his water discipline with philosophy studies. In 1959  Parker won the single scull competition — one person  two oars — at the Pan American Games. In 1960  he competed at the Summer Olympics in Rome  finishing fifth.From 1964 to 1984 — from Tokyo to Los Angeles — Parker coached U.S. Olympic crew teams  both men and women. In 1975  he coached the first U.S. women’s national team to compete in the world championships. A year later  his U.S. women’s eight won the bronze medal in the Montreal Olympic games.Over the years  the rugged Parker — a lifetime athlete who was a muscular 6-footer in his prime — became the dean of all Harvard athletic coaches and  some say  the most successful college rowing coach of the last half of the 20th century.The cause of death wasmyelodysplastic syndrome  a blood disorder diagnosed in 2011 that was once called “preleukemia.” A memorial service will be held later this summer.The news of Parker’s demise shook Harvard to the core. “His legacy and impact on our program over the last five decades will remain ” said Nichols Family Director of AthleticsRobert L. Scalise. “We will miss him as a coach  role model  leader  and a friend.”“Harry was one of Harvard’s most illustrious coaches and he may have been the greatest college crew coach of all time ” said Jack Reardon ’60  executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association  who was Harvard University athletic director from 1977 to 1990. “In any chosen profession  there are people who are very good and there are people who are the best. Harry Parker was the best. Harry’s rowers revered him. He was a man of few words but those words counted  and he inspired his athletes to do better than they thought possible. There will never be another Harry Parker. I will miss him and Harvard will miss him.”Parker was the Thomas Bolles Head Coach for Harvard Men’s Heavyweight Crew  but he could easily have been called Professor Parker. He taught not only stroke rate and blade coverage  but considered rowing as a preparation for the discipline and commitment that leading a good life requires. “I think of myself as a teacher ” he said last fall. “What I do is nurture traits that are already there within the rowers. … I create an environment that fosters those traits.”Parker averred then that competitive rowers had to be hard-working  persevering  patient  disciplined  and resilient in moments of frustration. “It’s not — quote — ‘fun’ the way other sports are ” he said. “Basically  it’s hard work.”Faust was drawn to the coach’s own conception of himself. “Harry Parker epitomized the coach as teacher ” she said. “He saw each of his rowers not just as an athlete but as a whole person  a person learning not just how to excel at a sport but how to live a life.”Harry Lambert Parker was born in Fitchburg  Mass.  in 1935  the son of Ruth Parker and Lambert Achilles Parker  a builder and contractor. He went to high school in East Hartford  Conn.  where he played baseball and basketball (and became the “lowest-scoring center in the school’s history ” he once said). From the beginning  though  Parker was an aggressive and competitive athlete — traits he carried far into adulthood  when he continued to row  run the Harvard Stadium steps with his crews  play pick-up soccer  hike  cross-country ski  windsurf  and golf. Parker’s athletic mindset was so intense and competitive that he once claimed that he didn’t take up ice hockey because he would be too dangerous wielding a stick.Finishing high school  he won an NROTC scholarship to study at the University of Pennsylvania  where he took up rowing to satisfy a physical education requirement. He was immediately hooked. “I had the feeling that this is wonderful  a great sense of power ” he remembered last year of his first moments gliding over water in a sleek boat. “You can harness the strength in your body  and you can make the boat move.”Those who saw Parker at Harvard’s Newell Boathouse on the Charles remember his regular rowing workouts and his easeful walk along the dock to the river  clad like a modern Neptune in a wetsuit. He had a powerful athlete’s body well into his 70s  a grip like bolt cutters  and the tanned face of a lifelong sailor. Parker also sported a close-cropped beard that followed the outline of his jaw. (One of his heavyweight crew veterans once asked Parker what he would be if he could choose among all the figures in history. The skipper of a pirate ship  the coach answered with a smile.)Parker was quiet  but on the river he had “the voice ” coaching his rowers with a God-like rumble through the cardboard megaphone he favored.“God” was  in fact — behind his back — one of Parker’s nicknames  along with “The Weird One” for his idiosyncratic coaching style and his penchant for going his own way. He was also called “King of the Crews ” and was once dubbed the “River Warrior” by Harvard Magazine.When he arrived at Harvard in 1960  Parker coached the freshmen crews. At the time  the Charles River smelled  a heavy rain left it jammed with debris  and swimming was unwise. Simply falling into the water required a tetanus shot. “The river was foul ” he said in 2010. “Now  it’s wonderful.”Parker spent six days a week on the open Charles for more than a half century.Harvard’s most famous coach is survived by his wife  former competitive rower and Olympic gold medalist Kathryn Elliott “Kathy” Keeler; two sons  George ’83 and David ’85; a daughter  Abigail  ’17; and five grandchildren. He is also survived by generations of students inspired by the Zen and quiet zest of his riverine discipline.Many of the tributes coming his way will sound like that of coxswain Paul Hoffman ’68  who was part of the Harvard eight that made it to the Olympics in Mexico City. In a Harvard Magazine profile of Parker  Hoffman called him “the single best teacher I had at Harvard College or Harvard Law School. I personally still approach all major challenges using the metaphor of rowing.”To share your reflections of legendary rowing coach Harry Parker  visitCampus and Community.
Tucker Collins,It is with very mixed emotions that we write this Memorial Minute in honor of Dr. Tucker Collins — joyful because we are celebrating the distinguished accomplishments of a good colleague  collaborator  and friend; and  at the same time  deeply saddened by his untimely death at the age of but 54 years due to an aggressive brain tumor.Tucker received his BA from Amherst College in 1975  and completed his M.D.  Ph.D. at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1981. He completed his residency training in Anatomical Pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 1986 under his mentor Dr. Ramzi S. Cotran.  Tucker then became one of the first research fellows in the newly established Vascular Research Division  headed by Dr. Michael Gimbrone.  He worked in the laboratory of Dr. Jordan Pober  where he performed some of the earliest studies of the induction of major histocompatibility antigens in the human endothelial cell  providing novel insights into the active role played by the blood vessel wall in immunological reactions. This work was among the first to apply the tools of molecular biology to the study of endothelium  and was followed by his successful efforts to clone PDGF A and B chain cDNAs from endothelial-derived libraries.Tucker rose to the rank of Professor of Pathology in 1992.  In 2001  he was named the S. Burt Wolbach Professor of Pathology and the Chief of Pathology at Boston Children’s Hospital. Under his leadership  the department underwent unparalled growth in its clinical services.  Tucker was also deeply committed to consolidating and expanding the department’s Research Division  already instituting important improvements.  Among many of his professional accomplishments  Tucker was a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Research  a founding member of the North American Vascular Biology Association  and an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association.  He was also a Scholar in the Academy at Harvard Medical School  and past President of the American Society for Investigative Pathology and of the New England Society of Pathologists.   Tucker received many distinguished awards in his too brief career  including a MERIT Award from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute  the Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Award in Experimental Pathology (FASEB)  and the Partners in Excellence Individual Award from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.To remember Tucker is to remember his three great passions: teaching  research  and his family — notwithstanding his legendary love for sailing at the helm on the high seas!In the Harvard Medical School community  Tucker was deservedly recognized as a vibrant teacher and committed mentor (1). He served for more than a decade as the Associate Master of the Peabody Society  interacting with medical school students on a daily basis  providing academic guidance and personal support to literally hundreds of individuals during the critical formative stages of their career development. He was a passionate advocate of Pathology as an academic discipline  and provided dynamic leadership as a Course Director in the core undergraduate medical curriculum. His impact as an educator was further amplified by his role as a coeditor of the sixth edition of Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease  as well as the author of numerous definitive reviews and book chapters. Tucker led by example in the laboratory—the first one at the bench in the in the wee hours of the morning.  Tucker is remembered as voracious reader of the literature who always developed a comprehensive understanding of any problem.  His colleagues would ask him to review papers prior to submission because no one was a tougher critic than Tucker  and if the papers passed him  it was likely to pass review.  His energy was seemingly boundless  bolstered by a bottomless cup of coffee  and his enthusiasm for doing science infectious. His numerous trainees and collaborators benefited from his personal generosity of spirit.  Many have gone on to populate academia and industry—a truly living legacy of his scientific endeavors.In his research  it is probably a little appreciated fact  known perhaps only to his friend in college and medical school days  Dr. Berk (a member of this committee) that Tucker’s research career began at Rochester.  At that time  the two…”came up with the crazy idea to study microtubule structures in Tetrahymena.” According to Dr. Berk  they made “beautiful electron micrographs of these microtubules  and sent [their] data to a long-forgotten journal  which promptly rejected it as lacking novelty.”  We’re not sure how that could be!Nevertheless  Tucker was regarded as a trailblazer in the molecular biology of vascular endothelium almost from the get-go (1). His seminal contributions included elucidation of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the “activation” of the endothelium by pro-inflammatory cytokines  as well as the first description of the transcriptional regulation of PDGF molecules in the human endothelial cell  and the functional dissection of the promoters of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Perhaps the most significant area of his laboratory’s contributions was the exploration of the central role of the NF-kappa B transcription factor family in endothelial homeostasis. This corpus of work pointed the way to studies of the pharmacologic modulation of this pathway by proteasome inhibitors  as a novel therapeutic approach to the myriad manifestations of inflammation in acute and chronic diseases. Related work focused on other pathophysiological significant transcriptional regulators such as Egr-1  and the roles of the SCAN family of zinc finger transcription factors in development and disease. His final efforts had turned to an understanding of the pathogenesis of arterial disease in pediatric heart transplant recipients  bringing together his long-term interests in arterial diseases and his role as Pathology Chair and the Boston Children’s Hospital.For those of us fortunate to know Tucker’s wife  Mary Whitley  and his teenage daughter  Caroline  it is clear why his greatest passion was for them.  To know them is to understand the great support  comfort  and peace he had at home that made him such a success in his life  and such a truly courageous man in his dying.Respectfully submitted Hannah C.

Joseph L. Henry,Nothing about Joseph L. Henry was ordinary. In his academic career he excelled noticeably above others — as a student  teacher  department chair  dean  board member  national policy adviser  and as a mentor to many health professionals and policy makers.The valedictorian of every class in every school he attended  Joe Henry routinely completed the graduation requirements years ahead of schedule and moved up to the next academic challenge. He completed high school in New Orleans at age 15  Xavier College at age 18  Howard College of Dentistry at age 22  and then  while on the Howard Faculty  a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at age 26.Joe Henry’s national prominence was quickly felt in Washington  D.C. as he rose through the Howard University academic ranks from Instructor to Professor. In these years he served as the Director of Clinics and Coordinator of Research at the Howard College of Dentistry. When he became the Dean in 1966  he was much looked to as a national health policy leader  having served on several White House Conferences and a number of select national advisory committees for the VA  HRSA  NIH  DOD  and health professions schools across the country.Among many other honors  Professor Henry was elected to the Institute of Medicine and served on committees for several of their studies including The Future of Dental Education report which advised the closer integration of medicine and dentistry.  The White House called on his service three times  not as a leader in dentistry or the health professions  but as a national figure known for his ability to grasp major issues.   Accordingly  the White House asked him to serve on the White House Conference on Food  Nutrition and Health  the White House Conference on Employment of the Handicapped  and the White House Conference on International Relations.Dr. Henry was a national leader  but he was often found championing local city and neighborhood causes.  His commitment to his local community was strongly evident wherever he lived.  The Mayors of both the City of New Orleans and of Washington  D.C. celebrated Joseph L. Henry day in 1965 for Joe’s significant and valuable service to their communities and to the local government  in grateful acknowledgment of his many acts of service.In 1975  Dean Paul Goldhaber recruited Joe Henry to Harvard University to become Professor of Oral Medicine  Department Chair and Associate Dean for External Affairs. He was the first black professor on the Harvard School of Dental Medicine faculty  and one of only two at that time on the Harvard Medical Faculty.From July 1990 to June 1991  Joe served as Interim Dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.  At that time  there were serious discussions within the Harvard Medical Area to close the dental pre-doctoral program.  Joe Henry’s effective leadership during that transition period  secured the future of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine  and allowed it to retain its position as the first dental school established within a University setting.  His mentoring of students and junior faculty at Harvard during those years resulted in many who are now serving throughout the nation and world as productive faculty members  innovative deans and executive directors of important national and international professional associations.Joe’s innate understanding of people served him well as a mentor.  He was a master of timing his advice:  timing of mentoring within a career  timing of incremental steps taken in social justice actions  timing of organizational changes  and timing for leadership transitions.  Those who were mentored by Dr. Henry during times of stress  were often challenged by Joe to “make the best of it”  to “pull yourself together  focus  and apply your skills.”  Joe Henry believed for all of us  that every achievement involves overcoming some adversity and that breaking through those barriers is what makes the accomplishment satisfying.  With this supportive  but “you must rise to the occasion” attitude  Joe stimulated many students and colleagues to try harder and do better than we might have without his mentoring.Joe Henry was a calm but persistent leader within his profession during the Civil Rights Movement.  Being the first African American to break through a number of professional barriers  he carried the civil rights movement into the health professions.  In 1968  Dr. Henry established a dental clinic at Resurrection City  the tent city in D.C.  as part of the Poor People’s Campaign initiated by Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.   He mentored hundreds of “up and coming” men and women of color throughout the health professions  including among many others  the first African American woman to become dean of a U.S. school of dentistry.  Dr. Henry believed in the importance of mentoring and cared about the academic and career advancement of students  trainees and junior faculty without regard to race  ethnicity or gender.  He was the consummate teacher  clinician  researcher and role model.Joe Henry was a nationally ranked contract bridge player.  He combined his steady activism as a civil rights leader with his massive intellectual ability to desegregate the bridge playing world.  From 1952 to 1967  he was the leading American Bridge Association (ABA) player  which was the national association of black bridge players.  As a young Howard University faculty member  Joe Henry led the effort to integrate the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)  which did not accept blacks as members or players.  Finally  after years of debates  motions and efforts to register for competitions  the Washington D.C. local chapter of the ACBL voted  in 1961  to admit blacks  just in time for the ACBL Summer National Tournament held that year in Washington D.C.    The black players wasted no time making their presence felt.  Joe Henry’s team finished second in the Sub-Senior Masters.  Then  in 1962  Joe Henry led a team to a national title at the ACBL Nationals.Often  when Professor Henry advised and mentored  he did it in association with food.  Joe Henry’s culinary skills were central to many of his most meaningful personal interactions.  Literally thousands of students  faculty  friends and leaders in national decision making positions have enjoyed his home-made New Orleans Creole gumbo  prepared with special ingredients flown in from Louisiana and Maryland.   An invitation to an evening featuring Joe Henry’s gumbo was a valued invitation  and his home was open on Sunday afternoons for students and their families to enjoy.Joe Henry did not discriminate or hold back in his interactions with others.  He was tall and elegant and greeted everyone with a gracious familiarity.  He had a wry sense of humor  and managed to deliver his points of view with a straight face and a twinkle in his eye.  He knew the family histories of everyone  regardless of who they were  or their position within the school.  Joe’s leadership style taught us that we were all contributors to the school environment  and our primary purpose was to improve the lives of others.Joseph Henry knew the importance of loyalty.  He was  in particular  a dedicated and loyal adviser  and thus was sought out to serve in this capacity by many colleagues  decision makers  government leaders and institutional boards.  His skillful mentoring  visionary leadership and

Fritz Heinz Bach,Fritz Heinz Bach  a brilliant transplant immunologist and the Lewis Thomas Distinguished Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School died of a cardiac arrest on Sunday  August 14  2011 at his home at Manchester-by-the-Sea  Massachusetts.  He was 77 years old.Fritz was one of a small group of young biological scientists with the genius  insight and good fortune to be associated with a discovery that had a profound  long-lasting impact on their field.  He was generally regarded as one of the early giants of transplant immunology  a visionary with legendary ability to identify big concepts and ideas among masses of data and observations whose contributions changed transplant immunology as we know it.  He was one of the most articulate and dynamic speakers in the field who could explain the complex in simple understandable terms. He could converse fluently in several languages  including French  German  Italian  and of course English. His early observations on cell transformations which occur inin vitrocultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from unrelated individuals (for which he coined the term mixed lymphocyte cultures – MLCs)  his studies on the relation of these changes to the alloimmune response and histocompatibility antigens  and his early application of the MLC assay to the selection of compatible tissue and organ donors unleashed a veritable perfect storm of related progress in experimental and clinical transplantation that persists to this day. He later made major contributions to our understanding of xenograft rejection and to the importance of “protective genes” in protecting against stress and disease.Fritz H. Bach was born April 5  1934  into a Jewish family in Vienna  Austria  the younger of two sons of Leo Bach and Gertrude Rosenfeld.  After the infamous Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938  he and his brother  Bertholdt  were sent to safety in England in 1939 via the legendary Kinder Transport organized by the British to rescue over 10 000 predominantly Jewish children that were cared for by British families.  They were later joined by their parents in Bath  England.  As with many of their generation  Fritz’s maternal grandparents stayed in Vienna after hostilities began.  They were subsequently deported to the Theriesenstadt work camp in 1942 and later died in the Treblinka death camp.  A United States soldier sponsored the Bach family’s immigration to Burlington  Vermont in 1949.  Fritz graduated from Burlington High School before attending Harvard College as a scholarship student and obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in 1955.  He went on to Harvard Medical School where he became interested in immunology and genetics and graduated in 1960.Fritz undertook internal residency training at New York University where he came under the influence of Dr. Lewis Thomas whom he always credited as being the inspiration for his scientific career.  It was Dr. Thomas who apparently persuaded Fritz to attend a lecture by Peter Medawar given at NYU in 1961 on the antigens and mechanisms involved in allograft rejection.  It was at this lecture that Medawar allegedly encouraged the young  recent medical graduate to study these problems in vitro. In 1964  Bach and Hirschorn described experiments involving the culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes from two unrelated individuals in vitro for 7-8 days in which some of the cells underwent large cell transformation and division.  They estimated the percent of blast cell transformation and mitosis by microscopic examination of fixed smears.  They noted that PBL cultures of individuals in whom the probability of sharing HLA antigens had been determined by skin grafting (by a group led by another future transplant luminary  Felix T. Rappaport) had the lowest number of large cells and mitoses.  Bach and Hirschorn suggested that it might be possible to develop mixed lymphocyte cell cultures (MLC) as a typing test for potential recipients and donors of kidney allografts that could identify the most compatible pairs.  This potential application was complicated by the fact that as described it was a two-way reaction since both donor and recipient cells reacted to each other.  Only later could the recipient’s cells reaction to the donor’s antigens be quantitated by using stimulator (donor) cells whose transformation potential had been eliminated by prior exposure to x-irradiation or Mitomycin C – a culture modification graciously attributed by Fritz to a suggestion by Leslie Brent.  Later work by Fritz and others showed that lymphocytes generated in MLC cultures were cytotoxic to stimulator cells thereby connecting in vitro alloreactivity with in vivo graft rejection  i.e. the MLC reflected activation of the immune response and the derivative CML reaction (cell mediated lymphotoxicity) represented its effector arm.Fritz moved to the University of Wisconsin in 1965 and remained there until 1979 during which time he made additional major contributions to clinical and experimental transplantation. In 1967  he used the MLC assay to select non-reactive  compatible donors for the first successful matched bone marrow transplants performed for immunodeficiency diseases first by Robert Good in Minnesota and then in Wisconsin with both cases subsequently reported together as twin papers in The Lancet.  This was a milestone in clinical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) that presaged the widespread successful application of BMT in the treatment of diseases.  In the laboratory  Fritz and his group performed extensive studies utilizing the MLC and the derivative CML reaction to study multiple aspects of allograft effector mechanisms and histocompatibility antigens which eventually led to his being among the first to conceptualize that there were two kinds of HLA antigens – those defined by serological methods and those defined by MLC techniques (later called Class I and Class II respectively).  Fritz subsequently worked at the University of Minnesota from 1979 through 1992 where he continued and expanded his basic studies on T-cell immunogenetics and cytotoxicity  HLA function and structure and the H-2 locus.  While at Minnesota  he developed an interest in xenotransplantation which fostered productive experimental collaborations with J.L. Platt and A.P. Dalmasso and others that examined numerous aspects of xenotransplant rejection such as the significance of xenoreactive antibodies  the endothelial antigens they recognized  the role of complement and endothelial cell activation in discordant xenograft rejection  the concept of accommodation as a possible mechanism to enhance discordant xenograft survival as well as numerous pharmacologic  molecular and genetic strategies to prolong xenograft survival.In 1992  Fritz was recruited by the Department of Surgery of the New England Deaconess Hospital (now part of the merged Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and Harvard Medical School to be the Director of the Sandoz Center for Immunobiology.  This center was built with the financial support and endowment of the Sandoz Corporation (now Novartis) to support basic research on discordant xenotransplantation that hopefully would lead to eventual clinical application.  A tenured chair was created at the Harvard Medical School to support the Director that was named at Fritz’s request after his old mentor Lewis Thomas.  He became the Lewis Thomas Professor of Surgery at HMS in 1995.  The purpose of the new Sandoz Center was to focus collaborative  multidisciplinary research on xenotransplantation and related research areas.  Over the next eleven years  Fritz did just that: he fostered multiple creative and productive collaborations with Wayne Hancock  Simon C. Robson  Christiane Ferran  Miguel Soares  Leo Otterbein and others which examined in depth the immunologic  molecular  coagulation/hematologic and genetic mechanisms involved in the genesis and evolution of the endothelial cell activation/coagulation series of events leading to xenograft rejection and destruction.  A very important outgrowth of these collaborations was that Fritz recognized the importance of genes whose purpose it was to provide protection against stress and disease and the need to study how to take advantage of these cytoprotective and homeostatic systems in order to apply them to prevention and treatment of clinical diseases and inflammatory states.  One of his last interests was the homeostatic protective gene heme oxygenase and its product carbon monoxide and its potential application to organ protective strategies.  It is noteworthy that in spite of a strong interest in and commitment to xenograft research and to the eventual use of xenografts in human clinical transplantation  Fritz strongly urged caution against their premature use because of the possibility of introducing serious infections and other diseases into human beings.  At a United States Public Health Conference in 1998  he and others urged that a moratorium on the use of pig cells and tissues to treat people be instituted until a public commission was created to examine the problem and to educate the people in any potential dangers.Through his long and illustrious academic career  Fritz Bach exerted a profound and sustained impact on the transplantation field.He was author/co-author on approximately 800 papers  many of which were published in the highest quality journals.  He was a gifted  dedicated  and charismatic teacher.  His talks and scientific presentations given in a clear  confident  resonant voice to meetings and societies around the world were models of precision and clarity that exuded his obvious joy at the task at hand.  He trained  mentored  sponsored  and encouraged hosts of postgraduate students  fellows  and junior faculty who later rose to academic positions of great prominence and responsibility.  He was editor of Clinical Immunology (with R.A. Good)  and editor-in-chief of Xeno.  He held several important leadership posts: International Transplant Society (Council Member)  International Bone Marrow Transplant Advisory Committee (Member)  International Histocompatibility Testing Workshops (Chair) and NIH Experimental Medical Study Sections (Member).  He was also a respected and important member of the Society of Clinical Investigation  the American Association of Immunologists  the Transplantation Society  the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (named an honorary member in 1992)  and a charter member of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry.  He also served on the Weizman Institute International and Board of Governors.  It is therefore not surprising that Fritz’s prodigious scientific accomplishments and contributions were acknowledged with numerous awards.  These included the Distinguished Scientist Award of the American Red Cross (1983)  the Medal of the College de France (1984)  Foreign Membership of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (1987)  the Emilio Trabucchi Foundation Award (1989) and the Medawar Prize of the Transplantation Society (1995).  He also gained very unique honors late in his career (2004) when his Austrian citizenship was restored and in 2005 when the University of Vienna  the major university of the country he fled during the Nazi era  had recently started a laboratory to train young scientists  awarded him an honorary doctorate for his services and scientific contributions.Fritz Bach was married twice.  His first marriage was to Marilyn Brenner  a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ph.D. graduate with whom he had three children  a daughter  Wendy  and two sons  Peter and David  both of who later became successful academic physicians.  Marilyn and Fritz Bach were close scientific collaborators for years before they divorced in 1979.  Bach married his second wife  Dr. Jeanne Gose  a pediatric allergist in 1983 with whom he had three daughters  Kathryn  Erika  and Dana. This marriage also ended in divorce.  In addition to six children  he is also survived by four grandchildren  Maya  Jonathan  Andreas  and Caiden.Although Bach was passionately and totally engaged in his scientific endeavors – one of his collaborators (Paul Sondel) stated he spent every waking minute dreaming and hypothesizing the mechanisms of how the immune system worked and that the most exciting thing in his life was always next week’s experiment – he also did enjoy wide-ranging interests in classical music  sailing  tennis  travel  food  spy novels and Sunday news shows.  He was a regular participant in the Walter Brendel Symposium in Austria where he impressed all not only with his scientific and skiing prowess but also with his interest and understanding of music  literature  and even the culinary arts.  He was a warm  friendly  extroverted bon vivant who enjoyed the good things in life and was fun to be with.  He genuinely enjoyed being with and socializing with his many friends.  They will miss him dearly.Respectfully submitted Douglas W.

Roger William Jeanloz,Roger William Jeanloz  Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacologyemeritusat Harvard Medical School  died shortly before his 90thbirthday on September 28  2007  in the south of France where he was on holiday with his wife  Dorothea.Dr. Jeanloz was a leading  highly productive scientist in the field of chemistry and function of complex carbohydrates  a field more recently termed glycobiology.  He was born in Switzerland and had his early education at the University of Geneva where he performed the work for his D. Sc. thesis with Professor Kurt Meyer  well-known for research on the chemistry of starch and cellulose  and later with the Nobel laureate Thadeus Reichstein  on the chemistry of deoxy sugars. Roger spent a year in Montreal followed by a stint in Dr. Claude Hudson’s laboratory at the NIH and three years at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology where the chemistry and biology of steroid hormones was a major focus.  In 1951 Dr. Jeanloz was recruited to the MGH and HMS by Dr. Walter Bauer to carry out his research. Since the late 1920s Bauer had directed the clinical program as head of the “Arthritis Group” as well as research activities of the Robert. W. Lovett Memorial Group at the MGH and HMS. In 1951 when Dr. Bauer became Chief of the Medical Services at the MGH and Jackson Professor at HMS he nevertheless continued to direct the Lovett Group. He reasoned that understanding the chemistry and biology of the major macromolecules of connective tissues such as collagen  mucopolysaccharides (complex carbohydrates) and glycoproteins could provide the tools for understanding the pathobiology of rheumatic diseases.  He followed up with a major effort to recruit young scientists to set up modern laboratories for this research; Roger Jeanloz was among Bauer’s first recruits who later (1961) established his independent Laboratory for Carbohydrate Research within the Lovett Group.In his early work  Jeanloz utilized chemical analysis of relatively large amounts of carbohydrates to determine the structures of complex carbohydrates such as hyaluronic acid from human umbilical cords by methylation analysis. This procedure  developed by Jeanloz required large amounts of purified material and synthesis of the methylated products necessary for confirmation.  More sensitive analytical procedures such as gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy frequently utilized in this century that require only micrograms of starting material were not yet developed when he initiated his research   nearly 60 years prior. Jeanloz was highly successful and extended his interests from normal human complex carbohydrates to the glycans in lysosomal storage diseases  the structure of glycoproteins and much more. As noted by a former colleague  Sen-itiro Hakomori  now a Professor at the University of Washington  “Structural determination and synthesis are the major themes in Roger’s work. This trend is somewhat different from  or more authentic than  current fashion of ‘glycobiology’- in which the functional significance of carbohydrates is much emphasized  and the exact structure involved is somewhat neglected.” Indeed  Roger published an impressive number of important papers and several books and was the recipient of many awards. In view of his reputation in the field  he played a major role in organizing the International Symposia on Glycoconjugates. He was also a founder of the journal  Carbohydrate Research. Overall  we feel that no one contributed more than Roger Jeanloz to our understanding of the basic chemistry underlying glycobiology that was so necessary for what followed.When he first was invited to join the Lovett Group at the MGH in 1951  Roger was the author or co-author of two dozen or so publications in European and American Journals  the latter including J Am Chem Soc  J Biol Chem  Science  Arch Biochem.  Because his laboratory was at the MGH  the only appointment available for him at HMS at that time was Research Associate in Biological Chemistry since “fulltime” academic appointments were not given to scientists who worked at the Harvard hospitals. Following suite  in 1957  Roger was promoted to “Associate in Organic Chemistry in the Department of Medicine  Harvard Medical School”. Then  in 1960 to Assistant Professor and in 1961 to Associate Professor of Biological Chemistry. In 1969 he was promoted to full Professor of Biological Chemistry.  Roger worked with students throughout his years.  Early in his career he was a freshman advisor at Harvard University and in 1961 he was appointed as Tutor in Biochemical Sciences in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences; he retired as a Tutor only a few months before his death.If you encountered Roger in his laboratory  he appeared as a formidable figure  confident  enthusiastic about his work. But it was hard not to note the great smile. Many of his associates had spent long periods working with him and continued to collaborate with him after they left his laboratory. The congenial atmosphere in the Jeanloz laboratory was emphasized in the obituary written by the late Nathan Sharon with Mary Catherine (Suzy) Glick and Colin Hughes and published in the journal Glycobiology. Roger loved his life beyond science and teaching  which included skiing  mountain climbing  tennis and basketball.  He was always on the move traveling all over the world. He had the great support from his loving wife  Dorothea  a chemist who worked with him in his laboratory  as well as his two sons and two daughters.Respectfully submitted Stephen Krane  ChairPaul GoetinckKeith MillerJeremiah SilbertRobert Spiro
Heinrich Dieter Holland,Heinrich “Dick” Holland was born in Germany  but in 1939 conditions there led him to emigrate to the United States. Here he graduated from the Stony Brook School on Long Island. Dick then attended Princeton University  where he graduated in chemistry within three years at the age of 18. He continued graduate studies at Columbia University  and at age 23 joined the faculty of Princeton University. It did not take much time for his fame to spread and he came to Harvard University in 1972  where he became the Harry C. Dudley Professor of Economic Geology.Dick Holland was one of the founding fathers of the geochemistry of hydrothermal ore deposits as he pioneered the use of thermochemical calculations to deduce the temperature and chemical composition of ore-forming fluids from observed mineral assemblages. This made it possible to obtain reliable estimates of the temperature  pressure  and fugacities of sulfur  oxygen  carbon dioxide  and other components. In addition  with his students he investigated experimentally important questions about the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits. This included the high-temperature partitioning of elements between hydrous fluids and silicate melts as well as the interaction of hot water with rocks. These pioneering experiments also clarified the formation of porphyry copper deposits and of volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits.Dick’s pioneering work on solubilities  on stability relations  and on redox equilibria between fluids and minerals led to a better understanding of the transport and deposition of minerals in ore deposits. Furthermore  his studies of the oxidation of uraninite clarified the formation of Witwatersrand-type Au-U deposits and of the oxygen content of the Precambrian atmosphere.In addition to being a great theoretician and experimentalist  Dick Holland carried out important analytical studies  such as the first detailed fluid inclusion and stable isotope studies at Providencia  Mexico  and Bluebell  British Columbia. His belief that fluid inclusions could furnish important information about the chemical composition of hydrothermal fluids led him to develop ways to analyze their metal contents and gaseous chemistry.Dick examined how elements were dispersed and concentrated to form ore deposits and contributed significantly to our general understanding of the formation of porphyry copper  vein and replacement lead-zinc-silver  hydrothermal uranium  and evaposite deposits. His studies of volcanogenic massive sulfide (kuroko-type) ores complemented his interest in black smokers on ocean ridges and the oceanic magnesium budget. Furthermore  his work on iron formations  conglomerate uranium deposits  and metalliferous black shales had implications for the composition of the Precambrian atmosphere.Dick Holland was a perceptive  passionate  and interdisciplinary scientist. Typically  his mind envisaged what needed to be done to test a new idea. He raised questions concerning what field observations needed to be made  what samples needed to be taken (and how)  what laboratory analyses or experiments should to be done  how many alternative interpretations there could be  and how the available data could discriminate between them. Dick stood out from his colleagues because of his clear thinking about complex geological/geochemical problems and for his emphasis on the overall view.Dick’s insistence on collecting field evidence was illustrated during a study of hydrothermal uranium deposits in northern Saskatchewan  where he insisted on collecting so many samples that the amphibious airplane could not lift off until the pilot rebelled and took him back to the pier in order to send the samples by land.Dick Holland published 146 papers and authored  co-authored  or co-edited seven books  attesting to his productivity. In recognition of his accomplishments he became a member of the National and American Academies of Sciences and received the V. M. Goldschmidt Award of the Geochemical Society.It is important to note Dick Holland’s talent as a teacher and mentor to undergraduate  graduate  and post-doctoral students. They praised him for his patience  dedication  generosity with time and equipment  helpfulness  openness  and willingness to listen. His characteristic expressions were “What’s new?”  “Are you sure of that?”  “Who cares?”  and “Onward.” Dick was a genial  challenging  sage  and jolly colleague  whose laughter often spread from his office down the hall. His broad interests were not just scientific  but covered history and literature  particularly rare books. Most importantly  he was a warm and caring person  a great and loyal friend  and a loving and dedicated family man.Dick was predeceased by his wife  Alice  and his son  Matthew. He is survived by his sons John and Henry as well as by his daughter  Anne.Respectfully submitted C. W. BurnhamStein B. JacobsenMark Van BaalenUlrich Petersen  Chair
William Nunn Lipscomb Jr.,For much of his life  William Nunn Lipscomb  Jr.  was known as The Colonel. Students and co-workers in his research group addressed him as Colonel instead of the more formal Professor or Doctor  and he signed notes to them accordingly. In 1973  he was even designated an honorary Kentucky Colonel by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Known to his colleagues as Bill  Lipscomb adopted another title  Professor Lipscomb  which characterized him on the stage of Sanders Theater at the antic-filled Ig Nobel Prize ceremonies. There  as distinguished scientist  accomplished and versatile performer  prized date  and mischievous prankster  Lipscomb reveled in his labors.From 1959 to 2010 Lipscomb carried out research in structural chemistry at Harvard  serving as professor  chair from 1962 to 1965  Abbott and James Lawrence Professor from 1971  and Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry  Emeritus  from 1990 to 2011. He taught introductory courses in general chemistry  and more advanced courses in theoretical chemistry  biochemistry  and x-ray diffraction/structure determination. A vigorous and devoted mentor to both undergraduate advisees and members of his research group  he preferred to consult with them individually on their projects  incorporating ancillary topics ranging from baseball to Mozart  and frequently playing practical jokes. Group outings involved baseball and ritualized lunches with spoofing of faulty research  a prelude of the Ig Nobel appearances to come. Competitive in and out of the laboratory  Lipscomb was proud of an early unassisted triple play and never forgot it when a graduate student struck him out.Son of a physician (who was himself the son and grandson of physicians)  young Lipscomb seemed destined to follow the family profession. His family moved to Lexington  Kentucky  and he grew up in an environment of music and science. Lipscomb excelled as a clarinetist but was also fascinated by chemistry and physics. In high school he read sophisticated texts in both areas and conducted chemical experiments independent of his class. But when polio afflicted his sister  causing his father’s clientele to take their business elsewhere  Lipscomb turned to music to finance his higher education with a clarinet scholarship at the University of Kentucky. There  in addition to playing in the university band and campus ensembles  he explored topics in theoretical physics and chemistry  particularly quantum mechanics. Although he had read many of his father’s medical textbooks  the physical sciences had greater appeal  and following graduation he enrolled at the California Institute of Technology  where he pursued research in physical chemistry under the direction of Linus Pauling. Electron diffraction studies on the structures of gaseous molecules and the X-ray crystal structure of methylammonium chloride were complemented by coursework in X-ray diffraction  structural chemistry  and particle physics  and by classified research for the National Defense Research Council on nitroglycerin propellants. All of this work came into play in Lipscomb’s independent research  beginning when he took up an assistant professorship in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota.Pauling’s research in the nature of the chemical bond intrigued Lipscomb  who  unconvinced by his mentor’s ideas about bonding in electron-deficient compounds  set out to pursue the bonding question with greater scrutiny. He examined the family of boron hydrides  members of which were prepared in his laboratory and elsewhere. In Lipscomb’s approach to research  theory  experiment  and instrumental methodology were used with equal facility and reinforced one another  with group members involved in each area. Development of methods for low-temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction of the many boranes synthesized in his laboratory – most of which were highly volatile and required adept handling – made possible unambiguous structural assignments  supported by pioneering molecular orbital methods and charge distribution calculations  and the prediction of new compounds. Over a period of 20 years  during which Lipscomb moved his group to Harvard  more boranes were studied as well as carbon-boron compounds. The combined effort produced a new topological theory of bonding in electron-deficient species  central to which was the concept of stable 3-center  2-electron bonds  breaking precedent with the conventional Lewis octet structure and shifting focus from localized electrons to orbitals. Lipscomb’s structural systematics had predictive utility not only for structures but also for chemical behavior in neutral and charged species of boranes and carboranes as well as species not ordinarily considered borane analogs  including nonclassical carbonium ions. For these penetrating insights  Lipscomb was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1976. By that time he had extended his structural work to biological molecules  in particular the study of the structure and behavior of enzymes. With formidable expertise in X-ray crystallography and theory development  his group determined the high-resolution structure of the enzyme carboxypeptidase A and went on to study the mechanisms of catalysis and allosteric behavior for several other  much larger enzymes including what is now a textbook example  dodecameric aspartate transcarbamoylase.Performing music at a high artistic level engaged Lipscomb throughout his scientific career. During graduate work and his first faculty position at Minnesota  he played first chair clarinet in the civic orchestras of Pasadena and Minneapolis. Chamber music became his focus upon his move to Harvard  with concerts home and abroad with friends  occasionally for lecture audiences. For years he took part in Music House Party  a select gathering of musicians  where his knowledge of repertory and editions was legendary. Bill’s sharp musical imagination  coupled with comic timing  made for wonderful matches of wit at House Party and memorable impromptu clarinet performances on the Ig Nobel stage.William Lipscomb was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and American Physical Society  and a recipient of prizes in both physical chemistry and inorganic chemistry from the American Chemical Society; he held numerous honorary degrees. He was proud of the accomplishments of his many scientific progeny  three of whom have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He leaves his wife  Jean Evans  and their daughter  Jenna; children  James and Dorothy Wright  from a previous marriage; and his sister  Dorothy Virginia Conrad.Respectfully submitted Stephen HarrisonDudley HerschbachRichard HolmEric Jacobsen  Chair
Rolla Milton Tryon Jr.,Rolla Milton Tryon Jr.  Professor of Biology and curator of ferns in the Gray Herbarium  an authority on the taxonomy and geography of ferns and fern allies  died the 20th of August of 2001  six days before his 85th birthday.Tryon spent his life studying the Pteridophyta  ferns and fern allies. This group of vascular plants represents an early evolutionary branch in the land plants. They once dominated the vegetation of the planet  and their fossilized remains gave rise of much of the carbon deposits of the world. Outside of horticultural and ornamental importance ferns largely hold a place as organisms of interest in understanding the history of terrestrial vegetation and in understand the earth over time and space.He was born on August 26  1916  in Chicago  where his father was a professor of American history and education at the University of Chicago. An A.A. degree in 1935 was followed by a B.S. in 1937  both from the University of Chicago. These were followed in quick succession by a Ph.M. from the University of Wisconsin in 1938  and an M.S. in 1940 and Ph.D. in 1941  both from Harvard. At Harvard he studied under the direction of Professor M. L. Fernald and Mr. Charles A. Weatherby at the Gray Herbarium. To say that Tryon spent his life studying ferns is perhaps an understatement. His first scientific paper  published in 1934 when he was 18 years old was on ferns that he had observed around his family’s summer cottage near the dunes in Chesterton  Indiana.As was the case with most of the Harvard botanists  he brought his botanical training to the war effort during WWII as a lab technician in the U. S. Chemical Warfare Service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is said that his father suggested a second Ph.D. in chemistry – this in order to earn a living.He served briefly as an instructor at Dartmouth College and then at the University of Wisconsin. In 1945 he became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. Here he met Alice Faber  who was his student and then his wife. Together they studied ferns; their interest in all aspects of ferns was limitless and extended to all aspects of their professional and private lives. Ferns were everywhere indoors  on the wall  and in the garden. From 1947 to 1957 Tryon was an associate professor of Botany at Washington University in Saint Louis and assistant curator in the herbarium of the Missouri Botanical Garden. There  the Tryons organized a symposium dedicated to topics in plant sciences; it became a yearly event that continues today.In 1957 the Tryons traveled to Peru and initiated a study of the rich fern flora of that country. With this Tryon began research on the fern flora of the American tropics and that interest would last the rest of his life. Of particular interest were the tree ferns and on this topic Tryon published extensively throughout his career. Following a year at the University of California Herbarium at Berkeley as a research associate  he was appointed  in 1958  Curator of Ferns at the Gray Herbarium at Harvard. There he remained until after his retirement in 1987. In 1972 he was appointed professor of biology in the Biology Department under the committee on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and through that appointment he supervised several graduate students who were to become the leaders of the next generation of pteridologists.Tryon is recognized for his taxonomic research  particularly on American and tropical species of ferns. Best known are his book Ferns and Allied Plants: with Special Reference to Tropical America  coauthored with Alice F. Tryon (published in 1982) and his work on the ferns of Peru  Pteridophyta of Peru  completed in retirement and consisting of 28 contributions in 6 parts and 837 pages. Early books on the ferns of Minnesota and Wisconsin were standard works for regional floristic studies. He demonstrated in all of his work precision  encyclopedic knowledge of the world’s fern flora  and a firm grounding in botanical nomenclature in the tradition of his Harvard mentor Charles Weatherby.The deep evolutionary questions of fern relationships led him to the study of plant geography – how ferns in particular where distributed in space and time. He taught a course in biogeography and his last paper was on fern migration routes and the assemblage of the present day flora of the Serra Ricardo Franco in Brazil.Tryon showed attachment and loyalty to several institutions. He served various roles in the American Fern Society  a society to which he belonged for 69 years. He was president in 1974-1975 and was made an honorary member of the society in 1978. The New England Botanical Club  which is headquartered here at Harvard  also received his attention. He served as recording secretary (1964-1968)  associate editor of the Society’s Journal Rhodora (1961-1977)  editor-in-chief (1977-1981)  vice-president (1984-1986) and president (1986-1988).Following his retirement from Harvard he became an adjunct professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa  where he continued work on ferns with his wife  Alice.Respectfully submitted O.

Mary Ellen Wohl,Dr. Mary Ellen Wohl  known internationally for her research in pediatric pulmonary diseases  passed away at age 77 in October  2010 at Rogerson House in Jamaica Plain. Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School  she had served as Chief of the Division of Respiratory Diseases at Children’s Hospital Boston for 22 years and Director of its Cystic Fibrosis Center for 19 years  saving and touching countless lives along the way. She was a pioneer in the development of the discipline known today as pediatric pulmonary medicine.  A Harvard trained physiologist who began her career at Children’s Hospital Boston in the early 60’s  she experimented with lung volume measuring devices that followed  her “hunch” that pulmonary medicine as it was then defined for adults  might well be something that could be applied to children.Mary Ellen Beck was born into a medical family in Cleveland. Her father  Claude Beck  on the faculty at Case Western Reserve  was the first Professor of Cardiac Surgery in the nation and her mother Ellen (Manning) was a surgical nurse. They had met in Boston when Dr. Beck was a neurosurgical trainee of Dr. Harvey Cushing at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and her mother a trained nurse there. Growing up in Cleveland  her father saw to it that his three daughters had role models in the world of medicine. From an early age Mary Ellen encountered many of his female classmates at dinner in their home. Instead of immediately following in her family’s footsteps  she took a slightly different approach  in college and  in 1954  she graduated from Radcliffe College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.Yet during her time at Radcliffe  she’d taken a number of premedical classes. She enrolled at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons  where she ultimately met her future husband  Dr. Martin Wohl. She received her medical degree from Columbia in 1958 and followed this with an internship at Bellevue Hospital in New York and a residency in Pediatrics at Babies’ Hospital. Although she originally intended to be a pediatric psychiatrist  after three months as an intern on the chest service at Bellevue  inspired by Gustave Laurenzi she became interested in the “new respiratory physiology” which she described in an autobiographical piece as “ the molecular biology of the 50’s.” She writes  “We looked at Goff sections; we fought about the definition of emphysema; we discussed airway obstruction  centrilobular vs. pan-acinar; we fluoroscoped; we managed patients on tank ventilators; we measured arterial blood gas tensions – an advanced technology of that era…    I must have been pretty hard to take.  Armed with my 3 months of training in chest medicine and with the stridency of the young  I set out to reform the care patients with lung disease received at Babies Hospital.  I borrowed a spirometer from Dr. Alfred Fishman’s laboratory – in fact  he taught me how to use it.  I acquired an outpatient clinic filled with little wheezers … and I daringly thought that pediatricians might call upon adult respiratory physicians for assistance.”After their marriage in 1961  the Wohls moved to Boston where Martin could do his senior residency at Mass General Hospital. Mary Ellen became a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health in the Physiology group led by Professor Jere Mead  who almost single handedly developed the field of Respiratory Mechanics. A ground breaker even here  she and Dr. Mary Ellen Avery were the only two women in the group.  Parallel to her training at the School of Public Health  in 1962 she started at Children’s Hospital beginning her nearly four decade relationship with Children’s hospital by learning  respiratory medicine from Denise Strieder.  Thus it was the marriage of Dr. Wohl’s physiology training on Jere Mead’s team and her clinical pediatric pulmonary medicine experiences that  led her to become a pioneer in the evaluation of infant lung function. Unlike older children and adults who can be coached in lung function maneuvers  infant lung function was an underserved area of medicine.Looking back today  we have to remember that this was a truly remarkable moment in the history of respiratory biology. Dr Mary Ellen Avery was working with Professors Clement Smith and Jere Mead on the concept of surface tension of the lung being dependent upon surfactant.  A little know field at that time  neonatal death with hyaline membrane disease was poorly understood  and thus it was that  this group were the ground breakers who linked surfactant with premature lung disease.  In this rich environment  Mary Ellen Beck Wohl was poised to become one of the leaders of the nascent field of Pediatric Pulmonology.  In fact  at this time in the seventies pediatric lung disease research was dominated by three women  Dr. Mary Ellen Avery as Chair of Pediatrics at Childrens  Professor Lynne Reid as Chair of Pathology   and Dr Wohl as Chief of Respiratory Diseases.During the 80’s  Mary Ellen Wohl rose to national prominence as one of the founders of the subspecialty of pediatric pulmonology. Internationally  over eighty of her trainees have risen to prominence in this subspecialty.Her most important clinical impacts were in the care of children with Cystic Fibrosis. This disease was first described in 1938 by another female medical pioneer  Dr. Dorothy Andersen at Babies Hospital  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.  Dr Wohl inherited the Boston Childrens Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Center founded by Dr. Harry Schwachman  one of the largest CF centers in the world at that time. In the early days of Cystic Fibrosis clinical research  children died in infancy from gastrointestinal complications. With the use of pancreatic enzyme supplementation in the 1950’s  children lived long enough to begin to show that the lung was a major target in this autosomal recessive disease. The CF lung develops tenacious mucus  which serves as a platform for chronic infection with bacteria such as Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.  During Dr Wohl’s tenure as Chief (1980-2002)  life expectancy for children born with Cystic fibrosis increased to over thirty years of age. She was an early advocate of aggressive care in both nutrition and respiratory therapy in children with cystic fibrosis  as well as constant surveillance for colonizing bacteria in the lung. These are now standard of care in the field.With thick mucus being a hallmark feature of Cystic Fibrosis lung disease  Dr. Wohl was the senior author of a landmark 1994 New England Journal of Medicine paper describing the efficacy of recombinant DNase I as a therapeutic in CF lung disease. Much of the mucus secretion was in fact found to be DNA released from white blood cells fighting the bacteria in the lung. Thus digesting DNA with an inhaled enzyme appeared a viable treatment option. This was the first therapy in decades which offered new hope for extending the lifespan and quality of life for CF patients. As a CF clinician  Dr. Wohl was known for her devotion to her patients  who adored her.In person  one colleague described Dr. Wohl as a “Force of Nature”. She was tall and large boned and full of energy. In her non-clinical moments  she was a gourmet and excellent chef. Dinner parties at the Wohl home in Brookline were always memorable. She joked about their rustic beach home in Nova Scotia  which was the only summer property around with outdoor plumbing and a Cuisinart. She inspired tremendous loyalty from patients and staff alike  because  when in need  there was no stone left unturned for anyone she tried to help.She received the Henry Chadwick Medal in 1995  joining many of her mentors in this award which recognizes outstanding lifetime accomplishments in lung research. In 2001  Dr. Wohl’s contributions to medicine were acknowledged with the American Thoracic Society Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2002  she received the Edwin L. Kendig Award  a joint award from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Chest Physicians for outstanding achievements in pediatric pulmonology. In addition to the awards and accolades Dr. Wohl received  her colleagues  students and patients remember her for her determined spirit  incredible generosity of spirit and heart of gold.Dr. Wohl leaves her husband Martin  a son  Alexander of St. Paul; a daughter  Laura Hornbrook of Quincy  and four grandchildren. Children’s Hospital Boston recently endowed the Mary Ellen Beck Wohl Professorship in Pediatric Respiratory Diseases.Respectfully submitted Craig J. Gerard  ChairpersonHenry L. DorkinJeffrey M.

Calvert Watkins dies at 80,Calvert Watkins  the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Linguistics and the Classics emeritus  died earlier this month at the age of 80.A towering figure in historical and Indo-European linguistics and a pioneer in the field of Indo-European poetics  Watkins presided over the expansion of Harvard’sDepartment of Linguisticsin the 1960s  and served as its chair several times between 1963 until his retirement in 2003. From then until his death  he served as professor in residence at the University of California  Los Angeles.“He was an inspirational teacher ” saidJay H. Jasanoff  the Diebold Professor of Indo-European Linguistics and Philology and interim chair of the Department of Linguistics. “He was brilliant and all-knowing. He seemed to know every language you had ever heard of  and he produced forms in languages like Sanskrit and Old Irish and Hittite with such panache that if you were interested in those subjects to begin with  he made you more interested.”Taking a course with Watkins as an undergraduate  Jasanoff said  inspired him to pursue Indo-European linguistics. Watkins was his doctoral advisor and mentor  a fact Jasanoff acknowledged in the preface of his most recent book.“My debt to my teacher — now my colleague — Calvert Watkins is of a different sort ” Jasanoff wrote. “No one familiar with his writings on the Indo-European verb will fail to see how deeply they have influenced mine  even on points where we disagree. Without his ‘Celtic Verb’ and his ‘Geschichte der Indogermanischen Verbalflexion ’ this book could never have been written  and without his example I would never have learned what constitutes a problem worth working on  and what constitutes a solution worth looking for.”Richard Thomas  the George Martin Lane Professor of the Classics and Harvard College Professor  joined Harvard’s Classics Department in 1977  and formed a fast friendship with Watkins that would endure for the rest of his life.“Cal Watkins was a man with a tremendous intellect and a tremendous personality  and a good heart. It is hard to think a person so alive is no longer with us ” Thomas said. “He was Harvard’s Indo-European guru  the glue that held together scholars and teachers across the University  and was immensely proud of the generations of students he trained who now hold positions in Indo-European and historical linguistics across the country.“His departure 10 years ago for Los Angeles  where his Sanskritist wife  Stephanie Jamison  took up a professorship at UCLA  was much lamented by colleagues and students alike ” Thomas continued. “He was an avid gardener  in North Cambridge  in his farm in Vermont  and in the recent years in Los Angeles. Travel  food  drink  and companionship  with his beloved Stephanie  with family  friends  and the family of friends — he was my daughter’s godfather — these were what occupied him in his leisure. And even at leisure  his mind remained engaged with the issues of language and linguistic culture that made him such a bright star in our firmament. Those lucky to have been part of his world will cherish our memories.”Watkins spent nearly his entire academic career at Harvard. He was a member of the Harvard Class of 1954  and was awarded a Ph.D. in linguistics in 1959. He was also a member of the Society of Fellows  and taught exclusively at Harvard until his retirement and his move west.Watkins’ research was focused on the linguistics and the poetics of all the earlier Indo-European languages and societies  particularly Greek  Latin and Italic  Celtic (especially Early Irish)  Anatolian (especially Hittite and Luvian)  Vedic Indic  and Old Iranian. Much of his work was also focused on historical linguistic theory and method and Indo-European genetic comparative literature.Watkins was the author of several books  including  “How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics ” which was awarded the American Philological Association’s Goodwin Prize in 1998. Other books by Watkins include “Indo-European Origins of the Celtic Verb I ” “The Sigmatic Aorist ” and “Indogermanische Grammatik III/1.”Watkins contributed to dozens of other publications  and authored more than 150 scholarly articles and reviews  more than 50 of which were published in three volumes as selected writings.  On a more popular level  he was the editor of the Indo-European root appendix to the “American Heritage Dictionary ” first published in 1969. Together with an accompanying essay  the appendix was later published in a separate edition and included in subsequent editions of the dictionary.  Accessibly written  it reached a large public and inspired an interest in linguistics and Indo-European in many casual readers  as well as in some who went on to enter the profession.Watkins was also particularly active in the academic world  serving as president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1988  and was an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  a member of the American Philosophical Society  a corresponding fellow of the British Academy and of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres  correspondant etranger  associé etranger  membre de l’Institut. He gave the Gaisford Lecture by invitation of the faculty of Classics of the University of Oxford in May 2000.Watkins is survived by his wife and by four children  Cynthia Watkins  David Cushman  Catherine Cushman  and Nicholas Watkins  and by eight grandchildren. Plans for a memorial service are not known at this time.

Aguilar  an authority on strategic planning and general management who also made his mark on generations of students as a gifted and caring teacher  died on Feb. 17 in Portsmouth  N.H.  at the age of 80. He had been battling gallbladder cancer for the past three years. He was a member of the active HBS faculty for more than three decades. He joined the HBS faculty in 1964 while still a doctoral student and became a full professor with tenure in 1971.“Frank Aguilar was a serious student and insightful observer of what general managers do and how they do it ” saidStephen A. Greyser  the Richard P. Chapman Professor of Business AdministrationEmeritus  and a longtime friend and colleague of Aguilar. “For more than 30 years  Frank helped countless students and practitioners understand the complex responsibilities facing business leaders through his exemplary teaching and well-regarded books on general management issues. Beyond that ” Greyser continued  “he was a wonderfully considerate person who treated everyone with kindness and respect.”At HBS Aguilar taught courses in general management  accounting and control  business policy  and ethics in the M.B.A. program and several executive education programs. A prolific case writer  Aguilar authored or co-authored more than 100 case studies during his career.His involvement in business education went beyond HBS. To increase the number of minorities embarking on careers in management  in 1992 he helped create the Management Education Alliance  an organization dedicated to improving business education in universities serving African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.A funeral Mass will be celebrated at the Immaculate Conception Church  98 Summer St.  Portsmouth  N.H.  on March 9 at 11 a.m. A reception will follow in St. James Church Hall  2075 Lafayette Rd.  in Portsmouth.Read the completeobituary.

James Q. Wilson,James Quinn Wilson  Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Government  taught at Harvard from 1961 to 1987. Perhaps the most prominent political scientist of his generation  he died in Boston  Massachusetts  from complications of leukemia  on March 2  2012.He spread his mind over most of political science: as a pioneer who defined or redefined the study of political parties  city politics  policing and crime  and bureaucracy; as a judge of American government scholarship in his textbook; as a master of both the current in our politics and the permanent in human nature; as skeptic of political science methodology and all grand theory; and as student of the morality of character. His work was known to every social scientist and he received nearly every high honor the political science profession can bestow. He was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003  the U. S. Government’s highest civilian award—marking a rare point of accord between the American Political Science Association and President George W. Bush. Though he tackled the most contentious issues and published articles almost exclusively in magazines  he was a model of the modest scholar.Jim Wilson was born on May 27  1931  grew up in Southern California  and attended the University of Redlands  graduating in 1952. After serving in the U. S. Navy  he took his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1959  where he taught before coming to Harvard in 1961.Although Wilson never sought the limelight  his scholarly work followed a sequence of related topics  each of them beginning from a political issue more important to citizens than to political scientists. His first book  Negro Politics (1960)  concerned blacks in city government  from which he proceeded to write City Politics (1963) with Edward Banfield  a life-long friend and colleague at Chicago and Harvard. In a far-seeing work  The Amateur Democrat (1962)  he studied the original “amateur spirit” in city clubs that was soon to fire up the McGovern reformers in the Democratic Party  then to jump across to Goldwater Republicans—groups now called the party “base.” These activist amateurs he contrasted with party professionals  who worked the city machines with less lofty motives. Wilson largely took the side of the professionals  who kept their cool in the face of passion and kept their distance from unworkable principles.After urban politics Wilson turned to the police  also unstudied by political scientists  and Varieties of Police Behavior (1968) appeared  a classic not only for its title. His focus was the cop on the beat  whose unenviable task is rather to restore order when it has lapsed than to enforce the law with set procedures. That everyday uncertainty makes it difficult to administer from above according to a plan and ensures that government in this aspect is about handling problems  not solving them. After the police it was natural to turn to crime  another political topic too hot for political scientists. Wilson wrote three books on this  one of them  Crime and Human Nature  with his Harvard colleague the psychologist Richard Herrnstein. His practical attitude began to earn him the reputation as a conservative  which he unsuccessfully resisted  for though he was skeptical of gun control  he was also wary of guns. As opposed to most criminologists  he found study of the “root causes” of crime to be useless  once declaring he had “never seen a root cause.” He preferred to study the visible behavior and character of criminals.Visible order was the point of Wilson’s famous article on the broken window (with George L. Kelling  1982)  which  left unrepaired  suggests that nobody cares and invites mischief and further transgression. Policing is a matter not only of catching violators but also of preventing intimidation and even annoyance to decent citizens from drunks  panhandlers  vagrants  and rowdies. People read situations from appearances  and Wilson’s political science did the same  collecting styles  types  and varieties from the surface of things and working inwards rather than moving from universal causes to particular applications.Wilson also worked from the bottom up. In Political Organizations (1973) he distinguished four types according to whether the costs and benefits were narrowly or widely concentrated  a matrix that focused on the consumer or client of the organization as opposed to the administrator. Recalling the “amateur spirit” of his early work  he particularly addressed “purposive” public interest organizations whose members ignore economic incentives and volunteer. In his masterwork Bureaucracy (1989)  based on his famous course Government 150  he considered the distinct cultures of different agencies  refusing to damn bureaucracy as such but looking at bureaucrats to see what they do and how they think. An organization easy to run is hard to change  he remarked in The Investigators (1978)  a study of the FBI. Its discipline is as much demanded from below as enforced from the top.Preoccupation with crime brought Wilson to reflect on the importance of character  a middle term between the imperatives of human nature and the choices of individuals. He wrote the book that he considered his most important  The Moral Sense (1993)  in which he borrowed from Aristotle on habit and from the moral side of Adam Smith. A good character  he argued  is one that looks on incentives morally  as either to good or evil. He once said: “Tobacco shortens one’s life; cocaine debases it.” The word “debases” was his judgment not only as a citizen but as a political scientist.In the best Harvard tradition  Jim Wilson was a brilliant classroom lecturer. He rendered extraordinary service to Harvard during the troubles of the late Sixties  helped to fashion the Core curriculum  and was the most skillful and accomplished chair of the Government Department in his lifetime. It was in gratitude as well as admiration that he received an honorary doctorate of letters from Harvard in 1994. He is survived by his wife Roberta—with whom  after a life of watching humans  he wrote Watching Fishes—by his children Matthew and Annie  and by five grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Michael J.

Erwin Hiebert  93  dies,From his first days in grade school until the last year of his life  Erwin Hiebert was deeply dedicated to scholarship. He was passionate about science  not only in regards to his own research  but he was also keenly fascinated with how philosophers and scientists before him conducted their work. That love of science and wonder were at the center of Hiebert’s long teaching career  the last 40-plus years spent at Harvard. Hiebert  professor of the history of scienceemeritus  died on Nov. 28  at the age of 93.Hiebert came to Harvard in 1970 as a professor of the history of science  becoming a professoremeritusin 1989. Throughout the years he was known as an active and prolific scholar and teacher whose students became well-known academics in the field.Hiebert received an M.A. in chemistry and physics at theUniversity of Kansasin 1943. He enjoyed a long  illustrious teaching and research career  beginning with his first teaching post in 1952 at San Francisco State College. He went on to teach as a Fulbright lecturer at theMax-Planck-Institut für Physikin Göttingen  Germany. The following year  Hiebert made a brief stop at Harvard as an instructor in the history of science  before moving to the Department of History of Science at the University of Wisconsin  Madison  serving as chairman from 1960 to 1965. Hiebert permanently returned to theDepartment of History of Scienceat Harvard in 1970. He was chairman of the department from 1977 to 1984 while also serving as a visiting lecturer and scholar at universities across the country and the globe.Though he reachedemeritusstatus 1989  Hiebert continued to devote most of his time to his own research and writing. He would journey from Belmont  where he settled his family in 1970  to Harvard nearly every day for many years after his retirement to work in his much-loved study in Widener Library.Hiebertwas a member ofmany organizations  including theAcadémie Internationale d’Histoire des Sciences  and he was a fellow of theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the author of three books: “The Impact of Atomic Energy ” “Historical Roots of the Principle of Conservation of Energy ” and “The Conception of Thermodynamics in the Scientific Thought of Mach and Planck ” in addition to numerous articles. His research and teaching focused on the 19th- and 20th-century history and philosophy of science. At his death he was completing a publication on the implications of the science of acoustics for music composition and instrument construction.Professor Hiebert was preceded in death in September 2012 by his wife of 69 years  Elfrieda Franz Hiebert  and is survived by his three children: Catherine Hiebert Kerst of Silver Spring  Md.; Margaret Hiebert Beissinger and husband Mark Beissinger of Princeton  N.J.; and Thomas Nels Hiebert and wife Lenore Voth Hiebert of Fresno  Calif.A memorial service for Hiebert will be held at Memorial Church in Harvard Yard on Feb. 17 at 2 p.m.Contributions can be made in Hiebert’s memory to the Mennonite Central Committee Global Family Program Supporting Education  21 S. 12th St.  P.O.

Charles ‘Henry’ Foster dies at 85,Charles H.W. “Henry” Foster  a 20-year associate of theHarvard Forest  a Harvard College alumnus  and for decades one of the nation’s leading environmental policy experts  died of cancer on Oct. 4 at the age of 85 in Needham  Mass.After graduating from Harvard College  Foster earned professional degrees in forestry and wildlife management from the University of Michigan  and a Ph.D. in geography and environmental engineering from Johns Hopkins University. From 1945 to 1947  he served in the U.S. Army. He was the former dean of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies.He devoted more than 15 years of his career to government  serving seven Massachusetts governors in such posts as water resources specialist  commissioner of natural resources  and  in 1971  as Massachusetts’ first cabinet-level secretary of environmental affairs. In 1986 he began a long association as a research fellow with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.Foster served as president of The Nature Conservancy from 1966 to 1967 and as professor of environmental policy at the University of Massachusetts  Amherst. He also taught at Brown  Clark  Stanford  and Tufts universities. He has published widely on natural resources and conservation.In 1970  Foster led the establishment of the forward-thinkingNew England Natural Resources Center(NENRC)  which sought to build bridges between business  government  and the burgeoning public environmental movement. In the decades that followed  NENRC laid the foundation for many conservation innovations in New England  including theWildlands and Woodlandseffort out of the Harvard Forest.In 2011 the New England Governors’ Conference passed a resolution honoring Foster for his academic and public service  and for his contributions to professional and nongovernmental organizations  such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  the New England Aquarium  the Conservation Foundation  the Appalachian National Scenic Trail Advisory Board  and the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission.“I had the opportunity to work with Hank Foster for 40 years. No individual has had a greater impact on how New England governs the use of its woodlands  its streams  its lakes  and its coastline ” said Henry Lee  Jassim M. Jaidah Family Director of the Environment at Harvard Kennedy School. “He was the true embodiment of a statesman in his ceaseless and selfless efforts to improve the environment in which we live. He was a role model for hundreds of his protégés and students  whose careers have been shaped by his wisdom and his leadership.”“Henry Foster was an extraordinary man and friend. He was focused on regional issues and policy solutions to major environmental problems confronting humanity  and he shared his expertise willingly to students and colleagues and inspired and amazed us all with his experience  energy  and insights ” said David Foster  director of Harvard Forest.He was a member of many national and international boards and commissions  and in 2007 received the Allen Morgan Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Massachusetts Audubon Society  a Golden Membership Award from the Society of American Foresters (2006)  and a Conservation Service Award from the U.S. Department of the Interior (2002). Owing to the range and longevity of his work  Foster is the only two-time recipient of the Charles Bullard Fellowship at Harvard University.Foster is survived by his wife of 59 years  the former Barbara Duchaine of Needham; a son  Jonathan  of Los Angeles; two daughters  Susan ’83  of Woodbridge  Conn.  and Frances  of St. Louis  Mo.; and six grandchildren.
John Milton Ward,John Milton Ward  Professor of Music at Harvard from 1955 to 1961 and William Powell Mason Professor of Music from 1961 to 1985  died in his home on Follen Street in Cambridge on December 12  2011  in the ninety-fifth year of his age.Ward was a path-breaking scholar in many fields  through whose classroom passed for three decades every undergraduate and graduate student in music at Harvard; a teacher whose conviction and thoroughness were impressive and inspiring  if sometimes intimidating. Many generations remember his undergraduate course in the history of music  and his introductory course for graduate students — a combination of boot camp and conversion experience—is forever inscribed in the memories  and in the scholarship  of those who experienced it. He put it very plainly: “I was simply trying to teach them to read and write.” Well-wrought oral presentation  responsible use of evidence  and clear and concise writing were Ward’s chief concern. Like the numbers of star hockey players  the course number “Music 200” has been raised to the rafters and will not be used again in the Music Department.John Ward studied composition privately with Darius Milhaud and studied musicology at the University of Washington  at Columbia University  and at New York University  where he took the Ph.D. in 1953. His most significant teachers were the Renaissance scholars Otto Gombosi and Gustave Reese  the ethnomusicologist George Herzog  and the organologist Curt Sachs. From 1947 to 1953 he was an instructor at Michigan State University and from 1953 to 1955 an assistant and then an associate professor at the University of Illinois. In 1955 he joined the faculty of Harvard University.Ward’s research grew broader with his experience. Originally interested in the music for the Spanishvihuela da manoand the lute music of Elizabethan England  he widened his interest as he recognized in these repertories aspects of dance music  of popular song  of music for the theater  and of improvisation. All of these became areas of deep interest to Ward  and he was an early adopter  indeed an inventor  of many areas of research that later contributed to the renewal and broadening of the field of musicology. His long-standing interest in musical instruments  and in the performance practice of music  made him an early exponent of what came to be known as the early music movement.His fascination with music and ritual  with music and film  and with music’s relationship to dance and to the theater led to publications  collections  and courses. After he became increasingly involved with ethnomusicology  Ward taught several ground-breaking classes in the field  some in collaboration with Rulan Pian. Subjects included Native American ritual music  Peking opera  Japanese Noh drama  and jazz. Materials related to these fields were scarce in Harvard’s libraries  so he founded the Archive of World Music  which began with recordings from his collection. He also established the Charles Seeger Room  a large collection of books and other materials within the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library that is devoted to ethnomusicology.After Ward retired  his long-standing fascination with opera  ballet  operetta  vaudeville  and social dance led him to form extensive new collections. He donated what he had gathered to the Harvard Theatre Collection of the Houghton Library. Two richly illustrated catalogues have now been published: The King’s Theatre Collection: Ballet and Italian Opera in London 1706-1883 (Houghton Library 2003  revised and expanded edition 2006) and Italian Ballet 1637–1977 (Houghton Library 2005). Most recently he concentrated on French scores and documents  which including material from the eras of Lully and Napoleon. During his decades of collecting  he formed close friendships with antiquarian booksellers  scholars  curators  and librarians from around the world.Robert Darnton observed of Ward that he had “a love of books and extraordinary expertise as a bibliophile. He could discuss fine points about printing and its connection with music and the theater  especially under the Ancien Régime in France  with an erudition that would have put the greatest pundits in Paris to shame.”One of Ward’s students  Professor Sir Curtis Price  Warden of New College  Oxford  and sometime Principal of the Royal Academy of Music  London  observed  “It is ironic that such a great teacher will be remembered mainly by his bookshelves but entirely fitting that his name will live on long after all of us are dead. To try to lighten our sadness  here is my favorite Wardism: in the early days of the early music movement  John quipped to me after hearing a natural trumpeter and baroque strings attempting to play a Purcell overture  ‘It’s not that he missed so many notes; it’s that he had so few to play!’”With his wife  Ruth Neils Ward  John opened his home on Follen Street to students  colleagues  and friends. Generations of superbly trained students remember him for his apposite precision  and historians of the performing arts for the collections that he bequeathed to Harvard University. Many mourn the loss of a meticulous scholar  a revered colleague  a devoted mentor  and a munificent donor.Ruth Ward  his collaborator in all things  died in April 2004. John Ward is survived by his sister-in- law  Margaret Padelford  of Seattle  Washington  and eleven nieces and nephews.Respectfully submitted Lewis LockwoodAnne C. ShrefflerWilliam P.

She joined the faculty of theHarvard College Observatoryin 1961  and remained there until her retirement in 1986.A daughter of the late Warren Harmon Lewis and Margaret Reed Lewis  Margaret Nast Lewis was born Aug. 21  1911  in Baltimore. She grew up and attended schools in Baltimore with her siblings  the late Warren R. Lewis and Jessica Lewis Myers. Much of her childhood was spent in Salisbury Cove  where her parents were founding members of the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory. Lewis was active in her support of the laboratory  endowing the Lewis Science Lecture series named for her sister  and and funding many building and scientific endeavors. Lewis graduated from Goucher College in 1931 with an A.B. in physics. She received a Ph.D. in physics from Johns Hopkins University in 1937.After her retirement from Harvard  Lewis taught and took classes at theHarvard Institute for Learning in Retirement. She published several poems and was working on a children’s book about a dragon named Fung Ling before her death. A great admirer of nature  Lewis had a particular fondness for the native flora and fauna of Mount Desert Island. She will long be remembered for feeding “Chippy ” a chipmunk she trained to eat peanuts from her hand.She is survived by many family members. A celebration of Lewis’ life will be held in Salisbury Cove next summer. Donations in her memory may be made to the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory  P.O. Box 35  Salisbury Cove  ME 04672. Funeral arrangements are being made byKeefe Funeral Homein Cambridge.
Transplant pioneer dies at 93,Joseph E. Murray emeritusprofessor of surgery atHarvard Medical School  whose many breakthroughs included the first successful kidney transplant  died Nov. 26  after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke at his Wellesley  Mass.  home on Thanksgiving. He was 93.Murray shared the1990 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicinewith E. Donnall Thomas  M.D. ’46  for conducting the world’s first successful organ transplant in 1954.At the time  relatively little was known about the intricate workings of the human immune system  but it was clear that a patient’s immune response posed a formidable barrier to transplantation  a problem Murray confronted while serving as a plastic surgeon during World War II.Murray joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps after graduating from Harvard Medical School in 1943. Many of his patients were soldiers with burn injuries  some so severe that the patient didn’t have enough undamaged skin for a graft. When Murray tried grafts using another person’s skin  he would watch with frustration as the patient’s body slowly rejected the graft.With immunosuppression in its infancy  Murray focused instead on the possibility of transplants from a patient’s closely related donor. By the early 1950s  he had achieved significant success with transplants between animals. Based on that progress  and the progress that others were making in the field  he proposed that a patient might accept an organ transplanted from an identical twin.In 1954  Richard Herrick  a 23-year-old man with severe kidney disease  was referred to Murray. Although there was no medical cure  Murray told Herrick he did have cause for hope. He had an identical twin brother  Ronald  with healthy kidneys. No one had ever been asked to donate a healthy organ  but Ronald was quick to agree.Knowing that they were taking an extraordinary course of action  everyone involved agreed to keep word of the surgery under wraps. The story did get out  however  leaked from an unexpected source. To confirm that the twins were indeed identical  Murray had arranged for the brothers to befingerprintedat a Boston police station. An enterprising newspaper reporter on the police beat got word of the unusual “booking ” and the lid was off.The surgery was performed Dec. 23  1954  at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Both brothers fully recovered from the groundbreaking operation. Richard later married one of his nurses  with whom he had two children before his death  of complications of kidney disease  in 1963. Ronald died in 2010  at age 79.Murray went on to perform the first transplant using a kidney from a nonidentical twin in 1959 and the first transplant from a deceased donor in 1962. The age of organ transplantation had arrived.Murray continued to lead the way in transplant surgery  serving as head of the program at the Brigham until 1971. At that point  he later told an interviewer from theJournal of the American Medical Association he decided to focus on his “true calling”: plastic surgery. “At heart  I’m a reconstructive surgeon.” That prompted his friend and colleague Francis Moore to note  “Joe’s the only guy who ever won a Nobel Prize for pursuing a hobby.”As head of plastic and reconstructive surgery atBrigham and Women’s Hospitaland Children’s Hospital Boston  Murray was a leader in craniofacial reconstruction. He introduced to the United States a procedure that corrected head deformities by resectioning and moving forward the bones of the head and face. In 1986  he suffered a stroke  and  while he was quick to recover and cleared for returning to the operating room  Murray chose to retire.“I had 48 years of surgery under my belt and I decided to just enjoy other aspects of my life ” he said.Those aspects included an active retirement with Virginia “Bobby” Link  whom he married in 1945  their six children  and 18 grandchildren. Murray published an autobiography  “Surgery of the Soul ”in 2001. On several occasions  he reunited with Ronald Herrick and the extended Herrick family  including Richard’s widow and children.
Farish A. Jenkins Jr.  72,Whether it was digging in the Canadian Arctic  providing guidance to colleagues  or spending hours producing chalkboard illustrations for the next day’s lecture  Farish A. Jenkins Jr. was deeply committed to probing the mysteries of evolutionary biology  while engaging and inspiring his students — a number of whom would become his colleagues.Jenkins  a Harvard professor of biology for more than 40 years  and Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology  was a mentor and friend to many. His death at age 72 on Nov. 11  brought sadness to the Harvard community and beyond.“In a University full of unique individuals  he was certainly one of a kind ” said James Hanken  Harvard professor of biology and director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.Jenkins was a distinguished vertebrate paleontologist  renowned for his fieldwork  who made seminal discoveries in respiratory physiology  bird flight  and the evolution of the earliest mammals.But Jenkins was just as well known for his engaging lectures  and the advice and counsel he gave to students and colleagues.“His lectures were really performances ” said Andrew A. Biewener  Harvard professor of biology. “He was just so engaging and a true gentleman in the way he approached relationships. He was a great teacher  an outstanding scholar  and someone who was always willing to provide sound advice and guidance to his colleagues.”A.W. Crompton  a Harvard professoremeritusof biology  had a hand in bringing Jenkins to Harvard in 1971. Crompton had Jenkins as a student at Yale University and agreed with others who said Jenkins’ lectures were “high-spirited ” but no less informative  according to Crompton.“He was a fantastic teacher  and the list of students he made an impression on goes on and on ” Crompton said.Crompton said Jenkins delivered his famous “Moby Dick” lecture while wearing a peg leg  reciting lines from the book  and mimicking Captain Ahab plodding along the decks as the crew listened below.“It was his way of demonstrating the elements of human locomotion ” Crompton said. “There are those who have said about his lectures  ‘They may not remember a word he said  but they will never forget him.’ But all of this is not to say his lectures were not informative. He did take things very seriously  and he could be tough. Once he took up an opinion  he stuck to that opinion.”Jenkins was also known to spend hours producing illustrations on the chalkboard for a lecture the next day.“He was also a tremendous artist ” Hanken said  “and he even used a pencil sharpener for his chalk so he could produce these lush illustrations.”Outside of the classroom  Jenkins was famous for his work in the field  which took him across the globe to East Africa  Greenland  and the American West. His discoveries includedTiktaalik roseae  the 375 million-year-old fossil of a fishlike creature  which Jenkins and colleagues called the missing link between fish and four-legged animals.Neil Shubin  a professor at the University of Chicago  was a student of Jenkins at Harvard and would go on to spend 30 years in the field with his mentor and friend. Shubin was with Jenkins on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut Territory  Canada  when they discoveredTiktaalik roseae.“He loved discovery and relished life. We would be suffering like dogs out in the field  and he would look at you and say  ‘How lucky are we?’ He was just hilarious  and after 30 years of working in the field with him  I look back and think about there being just one funny thing after another  even though we were in extreme conditions ” Shubin said.Looking for fossils in the Arctic can be “like looking for a needle in a haystack ” Shubin said  but Jenkins was able to be a part of some amazing discoveries because of his meticulous preparation and tenacity.“He just loved fieldwork  and he was smart about it. He made his own luck ” Shubin said. “He was absolutely tenacious. There were years where we failed to find anything  but he was able to learn from those failures. And he had the great sense to know when to quit or when to stick it out.”Steve Gatesy  a Brown University professor and another student-turned-colleague  spent several seasons in the field with Jenkins.“Farish was just so amazing. He could go from standing in front of a Harvard anatomy class  wearing a white lab coat  and then the next thing you know he would be back on campus with his dapper suit. Then you would see him using the X-ray machine  with a lead robe on. And then he would be out in the field  covered in mud and carrying a rifle ” said Gatesy. “In fact  someone out in Montana who met him for the first time would have thought he was a cowboy or rancher rather than a Harvard professor. But that was Farish.”Gatesy was with Jenkins and Shubin on Ellesmere Island  and is the one who dug up theTiktaalik.“In many ways  Farish was an old-fashioned guy  and I say that because he had an old-fashioned work ethic. He wanted to get it right  even if it took a long time  which is the opposite of today’s turn-it-out-quickly science. That is what was so refreshing about Farish ” said Gatesy. “When he would go out in the field  he would say that it’s going to take two or three years to get our bearings  then we will know where to look  and then we may get lucky.”“He was all about quality  which is so refreshing ” Gatesy added.Also known for excellent posture and impeccable attire  Jenkins left a large mark on Harvard and the world of vertebrate paleontology.He received his bachelor’s degree in geology from Princeton University  and then served several years in the Marine Corps. After the Marines  Jenkins earned a master’s degree and a Ph.D. from Yale.He began his teaching career at Columbia University  but he went to Harvard in 1971  attracted by the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and the revitalization of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Jenkins also taught anatomy in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology.“That was a very high-level course  with physicians and medical research people  and almost everyone who took that course said it was probably the best course they ever had ” Crompton said.Jenkins called himself a “hybrid”: an anatomist  zoologist  and vertebrate paleontologist.“He was not just a straight paleontologist  because he did a lot with anatomy  and how living animals function  and how that relates to fossils. Because of that  he helped to change paleontology from a dull description of fossils to something that’s alive ” Crompton said.James McCarthy  Harvard professor of biological oceanography  called Jenkins “the epitome of a Harvard professor.”“He was a true gentleman with impeccable manners  and he loved Harvard. He cared deeply for his students  and he was for many of them the best teacher they would ever know. He was a superb scientist  and a model University citizen. Every pursuit received 100 percent of his effort  and he expected the same of his students and his faculty colleagues ” McCarthy said. “He enjoyed life to the fullest  whether teaching human anatomy at the Medical School  digging for fossils in Greenland  or tending his antique apple orchard on his farm in New Hampshire. Moreover  he delighted in helping others to enjoy life as he did.”Jenkins met his wife  Eleanor  while he was a student at Princeton. The two lived for several years in Arlington  and also owned that rural apple farm.In addition to his wife  Jenkins leaves a brother  Henry Edgar II of Sausalito  Calif.; a son  Henry Edgar III of Denver; a daughter  Katherine Temperance Leeds of Watertown  Mass.; and two grandchildren.
Robert Dorfman,Robert Dorfman  the late David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy  Emeritus  was a leader in the introduction of mathematical methods to economics in the twentieth century. He died on June 24  2002  at his home in Belmont  Massachusetts.Dorfman made important contributions  particularly as a pioneer in the use of linear programming  characterizing production relationships in terms of individual activities with fixed coefficients. He collaborated in 1958 with MIT Professors (and later Nobel laureates) Robert M. Solow and Paul A. Samuelson on the classic Linear Programming and Economic Analysis.He believed that mathematical methods were key – both as analytical tools and as means of exposition. In this regard  Jerry Green  John Leverett Professor in the University and David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy  said at Dorfman’s memorial service in 2002  “He was an ambassador for the future of our field.”Dorfman wrote in 1954: “Is mathematics necessary in social science? I suppose not. It is quite conceivable that all problems could be solved by verbal means  just as it is possible to find that the square root of CXCVI is XIV. Such methods  though  would be not only painful but fearfully inefficient.”Dorfman also made significant contributions to environmental economics. Beginning in 1972  he edited with his wife  Nancy S. Dorfman  three editions of Economics of the Environment. Testimony to the lasting value of this work is the fact that it is now in its sixth edition (edited since 2000 by Robert Stavins  Albert Pratt Professor of Business and Government at the Kennedy School).In this realm  Dorfman understood the importance of the underlying natural science. His analysis of water resources in Pakistan  for example  drew on collaborations with engineers and hydrologists. He was for many years an affiliate of Harvard’s Center for Population Studies  where he helped introduce optimization methodologies for resource management to developing countries.Dorfman’s career at Harvard spanned 32 years. He was Professor of Economics from 1955 to 1972  and then David A. Wells Professor of Political Economy until his retirement in 1987. He was known by junior colleagues as a marvelous mentor. Henry Rosovsky once said that the kindest five words that can be said to a young scholar are  “I have read your thesis.” Jerry Green has observed  “That was exactly what Bob said to me the first time we met. I am sure he said the same to many others.”From 1976 to 1984  Dorfman served as editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Green  an associate editor  observed his style: “I saw how he worked with articles and authors of all kinds. Diamonds in the rough had to be polished.”Dorfman enjoyed a reputation as a masterful teacher  especially at the graduate level. He taught mathematical economics  microeconomic theory  macroeconomic theory  and econometrics  and thereby – in the words of Dale Jorgenson  Samuel W. Morris University Professor – “almost single- handedly brought the Harvard graduate program to the level of competing institutions.” Jorgenson recalls the course he took from Dorfman  and counts himself among “the fortunate students who were brought to the frontier of research in economic theory.”In the 1970s  Dorfman launched a seminar series on the economics of information and organizations with Professor Kenneth Arrow and Richard Zeckhauser  Frank Plumpton Ramsey Professor of Political Economy at the Kennedy School. Generations of young scholars benefitted from this colloquium  including Green  who later became a co-chair. Zeckhauser recalls that “the most faithful presenter was Eric Maskin (now Professor of Economics)  who was then starting to develop his pioneering work in mechanism design that would ultimately win him the Nobel Prize.”Born on October 27  1916  in New York City  Dorfman received his B.A. in mathematical statistics from Columbia College in 1936 and an M.A. in economics from Columbia University in 1937. Dorfman was a wartime pioneer in operations research. From 1939 to 1943  he worked as a statistician for the federal government  and then served during World War II as an operations analyst for the U.S. Army Air Force  based in the Southwest Pacific theater and in Washington  D.C.After the war  Dorfman enrolled at the University of California  Berkeley  earning his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1950. He joined the faculty at Berkeley  where he was an associate professor of economics when he moved to Harvard in 1955.Among his scholarly contributions were four classic articles in the American Economic Review: “Mathematical or ‘Linear’ Programming” (1953)  “Operations Research” (1960)  “An Economic Interpretation of Optimal Control Theory” (1969)  and “Incidence of the Benefits and Costs of Environmental Programs” (1977).Dorfman was a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  as well as vice president of the American Economic Association  and vice president of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists. In 1972  when Dorfman was inducted as a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association  his citation included this summary: “Robert Dorfman’s characteristic intellectual style is based on a deep and painstaking mastery of the theoretical fundamentals  leading to a clear intuitive grasp of intellectual questions and thence to masterly exposition.”Thirty years later  his co-author Robert Solow characterized him as “always polite  even self- deprecating  never assertive  he nevertheless stood his ground. If Bob Dorfman mildly and quizzically expressed some hesitation about your pet idea  it was always a good move to look up  just in case a boulder was about to crash down on you—politely  of course.”According to his wife  Nancy  Dorfman turned to mathematics in college as a substitute for poetry  after concluding that he did not have a future as a poet. But his love of literature was reflected in the clarity and grace with which he explained complex economics in simple terms.Robert Dorfman is survived by his wife  Nancy  of Lexington; his son  Peter  of Belmont; his daughter  Ann  of Newton; granddaughter  Joni Waldron  of Washington  D.C.; and grandson  Loren Waldron  of Newton.Respectfully submitted Jerry GreenDale W.

William Kaye Estes,William Kaye Estes  Daniel and Amy Starch Professor of Psychology  Emeritus  earned recognition early on as a member of a rare category containing those who exhibited both sterling personal leadership and outstanding intellectual contributions. His creative scholarship centered on learning theory  to which Harvard University’s own B. F. Skinner contributed in a major way. Many psychologists believed that the hard facts of learning theory needed a formal structure that could give rise to precise predictions. Bill Estes filled this need in 1950 in a classic paper  “Towards a Statistical Theory of Learning ” which described how organisms sampled the elements of a conditioning stimulus over successive trials so that  in time  the stimulus reliably evoked a conditioned response. Fred Skinner was not pleased that one of his best graduate students had abandoned the strict orthodoxy of behaviorism and theorized about mental events. Bill’s argument was so elegant it became one of the seedbeds for what evolved into the sub-discipline of mathematical psychology with a journal and a society founded in 1964 and 1977 respectively. Bill  along with Kenneth Arrow  Patrick Suppes  Richard Atkinson  R. R. Bush  and Duncan Luce  made pioneering contributions to many cognitive domains over a period spanning more than a half century.After spending his undergraduate and graduate years at the University of Minnesota and obtaining a Ph.D. with Skinner  Bill was called into the armed forces during the Second World War  during which he served as Commandant of a POW camp. After the war Bill was recruited to Indiana University and became an outstanding chair of the psychology department. From Indiana Bill went to Stanford University  then to Rockefeller University  and finally to Harvard in 1979. After his retirement in 1989 he returned to Bloomington with his wife  Kay  whom he had met as a student. They were married for close to 70 years. Bill died on August  17  2011  at age 92  several months after Kay’s death.While Bill was a member of Harvard’s faculty  he and Kay lived in the gracious home built by William James. This grand house provided them with the opportunity to display their generosity as hosts for visitors  students  and postdoctoral fellows. The ambience was especially festive during their annual holiday open house  where guests found prominent Cambridge residents mingling with faculty and students from Harvard and many area institutions.A quiet  reserved scholar who often waited what seemed like an eternity before answering a question  Bill nevertheless became an effective editor of three of psychology’s premier journals; namely  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology  the Psychological Review  and Psychological Science  for which he was the first editor. He also edited the six-volume Handbook of Learning and Cognitive Processes. In addition  Bill was one of the founders of the Psychonomic Society  the leading organization for experimental psychologists. Seldom do mentors with hisintroverted personality recruit unquestioning  long-term loyalty from many students. Here  too  Bill challenged expectations. Indeed  during his tenure at Harvard he was influential in shifting the mentoring of graduate students from ad hoc advisor groups to supervision by a single professor whose research matched the student’s interests.Given his quiet demeanor in personal interactions  many who did not know Bill well were surprised by the fact that his public presentations were coherent  clear  and peppered with humor. Many anecdotes capture a rare combination of reserve and playfulness. Two are worth citing.Martin Seligman  a prototypic extravert  recalled asking Bill his thoughts about the evolutionary function of dreaming. After a delay that approached a full minute Bill answered  “What  Marty  do you think the evolutionary function of waking is?”A second incident occurred when Bill was on the Stanford faculty attending one of the regular Friday afternoon research meetings at which the neuroscientist Karl Pribram was present. Bill was trying to explain an unusual set of results that had been presented by one of Pribram’s students. Bill began his suggested interpretation by saying  “Suppose there are a series of little drawers in the brain . . . .” At this point Pribram interrupted Bill by saying  “I have never seen any drawers in there ” to which Bill replied  “They’re very small.”Bill received almost every possible honor. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  a recipient of the National Medal of Science  the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association  the Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists  and was a William James Fellow of the American Psychological Society. The citation for the National Medal reflects the vast extent of Bills’ contributions. It read  “For fundamental theories of cognition and learning that transformed the field of experimental psychology and led to the development of quantitative cognitive science. His pioneering methods of quantitative modeling and an insistence on rigor and precision established the standard for modern psychological science.”Respectfully submitted R.

HBS’s Thomas K. McCraw Sr.  72,Thomas K. McCraw Sr. a renowned and much-honoredHarvard Business School(HBS) historian  teacher  and author  who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his book “Prophets of Regulation ” died Nov. 3 at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge  Mass.  after a long illness. He was 72.McCraw  who played an important role in making business history more influential and accessible in the broader fields of history and management  retired from the active HBS faculty in 2006. At the time of his death  he was the School’s Isidor Straus Professor of Business HistoryEmeritus. He was also the former editor of the Business History Review  a quarterly journal of research published by Harvard Business School.“Tom McCraw was an extraordinarily insightful and influential historian who won acclaim both on this campus and around the globe ” said HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. “His work will influence students and scholars for generations to come. Tom was the personification of the phrase ‘a scholar and a gentleman ’ and he will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him at Harvard Business School as a friend  colleague  or teacher.”McCraw joined the HBS faculty as a visiting associate professor in 1976  when he became a colleague and protégé of the late Professor Alfred D. Chandler Jr.  the great historian of American and global big businesses and organizations. Chandler was recruiting a group of young historians  including Richard S. Tedlow  now the School’s Class of 1949 Professor of Business AdministrationEmeritus  and Richard H.K. Vietor  the Paul Whiton Cherington Professor of Business Administration  to make HBS the center of research in business history.The group also became known for its excellence and innovations in the classroom  including the creation of a required first-year M.B.A. course “Creating Modern Capitalism ” an effort McCraw led and for which he edited an accompanying case book (published in 1997) titled “Creating Modern Capitalism: How Entrepreneurs  Companies  and Countries Triumphed in Three Industrial Revolutions.”According to Geoffrey G. Jones  the current incumbent of the Straus professorship and faculty chair of the School’s Business History Initiative  “Tom was a true leader and institution builder  who strove courageously and selflessly to create and sustain the big picture. A prolific and lucid author  he repeatedly made the case that history matters to the concerns of today. He was a master of using biography to deepen understanding of highly complex issues  but he was also a remarkable synthesizer  a skill he employed to pioneer the teaching of global business history in the 1990s. Charismatic  brilliant  and generous  Tom inspired generations of colleagues and students. In that regard  I speak from personal experience as well. He recruited me to join the HBS faculty from my university position in England. He was my mentor and my role model  and I will miss him terribly.”In his early work  McCraw combined his knowledge of history and public policy to provide a long-term perspective on issues raised by business and government relations. In an influential series of books and articles  he analyzed the rise of economic regulation in the United States in the past two centuries and explored how government policies affected competitiveness.As McCraw saw it  “Too much government regulation can kill a company  an industry  and even a national economy — but so can too little. Successful capitalism requires the persistent encouragement of private entrepreneurship  but also constant public monitoring to ensure that the system does not spin out of control.”He believed that a “foundational truth about capitalism is that no industry can regulate itself. The pressures for innovation and profit are simply too great — and never more so than in the present era of global capitalism.”McCraw’s most recent book  “The Founders and Finance: How Hamilton  Gallatin  and Other Immigrants Forged a New Economy ” was published just a few weeks ago by Harvard University Press. This volume is the first to tell the story of how several foreign-born financial specialists  including Alexander Hamilton  the first U.S. secretary of the treasury  solved the fiscal crisis facing the newly created United States of America after the Revolution  when the new country was bankrupt and without the power to tax.At the time of his death  McCraw was preparing to write another book that he planned to publish in 2015  covering 10 industries and important entrepreneurs who had come to the United States from other lands.McCraw was born Sept. 11  1940  inCorinth  Miss. The son of an engineer for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)  he grew up near several dam and power plant construction sites in Alabama  Kentucky  and Tennessee. Witnessing firsthand the people  events  and places that shaped the history of the TVA — one of the broadest reform programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal — influenced McCraw’s decision to study business history.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1962 from the University of Mississippi  which he attended on a Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship  and serving four years as an officer in the U.S. Navy  McCraw earned a master’s degree and Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin.McCraw began his academic career as a professor in the history department at the University of Texas  Austin  but came to Harvard Business School in 1973-74 on a Harvard-Newcomen Fellowship in Business History. He returned in 1976 for a two-year appointment as a visiting associate professor and was named a full professor with tenure in 1978. He became the Straus professor in 1989.McCraw is survived by his wife of 50 years  Susan (Morehead) of Belmont  Mass.; two children  Elizabeth McCarron of Wellesley  Mass.  and Thomas Jr.  of Bedford  N.H.; three grandchildren; and a brother  John C. McCraw of Gainesville  Fla. Another daughter  Carey  predeceased him in 1970.In lieu of flowers  donations in McCraw’s memory can be sent to the Belmont Library Foundation  P.O.

Frank Moore Cross  91,He traveled the world unearthing and interpreting religious texts from a forgotten time. His nearly 300 academic papers deepened humanity’s understanding of the time and place in which three of the world’s major religions would take root. And yet  over the course of a career that spanned five decades  Frank Moore Cross always returned to the classroom  teaching until his retirement in 1992  and advising more than 100 doctoral dissertations in the process.“My students have given me the greatest pleasure ” he once told the editor of the Bible Review. “I have always had the view that the first task of a scholar is to pass knowledge and understanding of method and the tools of his field from one generation to the next.”A world-renowned biblical scholar best known for his work interpreting the Dead Sea Scrolls  Cross died on Oct. 17 in Rochester  N.Y. He was 91. A memorial service will take place Nov. 10 at the Memorial Church.“He was different from most of the teachers I’d had ” said Jo Ann Hackett  one of his many students turned Harvard colleagues  who now teaches at the University of Texas  Austin. “He would rather teach you how to do something than go in-depth on what it was all about. It meant that when you left  you hadn’t read everything or done everything  but you had the tools to know how to do it.”Friends and colleagues remembered Cross as a consummate gentleman  with a dry wit and varied interests. He studied ancient texts  yet had a penchant for fast sports coupes. He read and wrote in several “dead” languages  even as he kept his Southern accent. He wore a bow tie to the classroom  and took up backpacking in his 40s  embarking on several long trips through the wilderness with his wife  Betty Anne. A lifelong swimmer  he learned to scuba dive in his 60s so that he could conduct underwater archaeology in the Middle East.“His interests were incredible ” said Harvard Divinity School Professor Paul D. Hanson. “He was always cultivating some hobby.”The son and grandson of Presbyterian ministers  Cross’ religious upbringing would guide his career.“Presbyterians are typically interested in biblical studies and originalism  the idea of what does the Bible say about this or that ” said Lawrence Stager  a Harvard archaeology professoremeritus  and a close friend of Cross. “I’m sure that helped him develop in that direction.”Raised in Alabama  Cross earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and philosophy at Maryville College in Tennessee in 1942. He attended McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago before going to Johns Hopkins University  where he earned a doctorate in Semitic languages in 1950. His foundation in hard sciences instilled in him a meticulousness that drove his research for the rest of his career.“He approached much of his scholarship as a scientist ” said List Professor of Jewish Studies Jon D. Levenson  another student of Cross who eventually became a colleague. “He was always interested in the tools used to make an evaluation.”Arriving at Hopkins shortly after the discovery of a set of ancient scrolls west of the Dead Sea  Cross studied under the legendary Near Eastern scholar William F. Albright  and quickly became one of Albright’s most important pupils. When Albright and his students were given exclusive access to some of the scrolls  Cross was allocated the often fragmented texts of Cave No. 4. In 1958  he published “The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Biblical Studies ” a 196-page book that became one of the leading texts about the scrolls and established him at the forefront of his field.“He had a marvelous way of writing ” said Peter Machinist  a pupil of Cross who is now the Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages  which is Harvard’s third-oldest endowed chair  and which Cross occupied until his retirement. “Chiseled prose  I’d call it. He could get into a small number of pages what others would need many more pages to say.”Cross came to Harvard’sDepartment of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizationsin 1957  having completed stints at Wellesley College and McCormick Seminary. By then  he was making regular trips to the Middle East to see and authenticate scrolls  journeys that often involved arduous plane rides  shoddy communications  and unsavory characters. Work sometimes entailed crawling through caves in 120-degree heat  negotiating with corrupt antiquities dealers  or excavating an archaeological site while bombs went off in the distance.“It was very cloak-and-dagger ” Machinist said. “Israel was a newly created state  and the whole region precipitated on war.”In a newspaper article about a trip to Lebanon in 1967  Cross recalled landing in Beirut to procure a collection of newly found scrolls. After proving his identity to an intermediary  he was directed to stand alone on a particular street corner one night  was picked up in a nondescript car  and was driven through the back roads of the city to a mansion where negotiations began. Unfortunately  the transaction fell through when the Arab-Israeli War broke out.Although the Dead Sea Scrolls remained an integral part of his work  Cross’ publications spanned the field of biblical studies. He was deeply interested in the ancient poetry and history of the Hebrew Bible  and was one of the world’s leading epigraphers.“I don’t think anyone can command as much as Frank did ” said John “Jay” Ellison  a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations lecturer who was mentored by Cross when he pursued his doctorate at Harvard. “As the body of knowledge in the field increased  and new texts were discovered  so did his knowledge. He grew with the field.”Unusually talented when it came to determining the age of a text through the shape of its letters  Cross’ expertise was sought by academics and antiquities dealers around the world. When carbon dating proved the age of a fragment he’d analyzed  he joked that he was happy to have validated the practice of carbon dating.Despite his prominence  Cross remained accessible to his students. His courses introducing the Hebrew Bible and on the history of the ancient Israelite region became staples for a broad range of undergraduate and graduate students. A demanding instructor  Cross was renowned for demonstrating kindness and treating his students as colleagues.“He’d often start his lectures saying  ‘As you well know ’ and  of course  you didn’t know ” recalled John Huehnergard  a former student and Harvard colleague  who now teaches at the University of Texas  Austin.“He had great expectations of his students ” Stager said. “These high expectations drove us to achieve at a higher level than we thought we could.”That congenial relationship extended to academic work. While studying in Israel in 1966  Stager found a pot shard with writing on it. He took a photograph of it  and eagerly sent it to his professor back at Harvard. Shortly after  a letter arrived from Cross  congratulating Stager on finding his first ostracon.“I assumed he’d publish a paper on it ” Stager recalled. “Instead  he simply encouraged me to do research and publish on it.”The pot shard became the subject of Stager’s first published academic article.“The field is developing  and we still don’t know the full impact of his career ” Stager said. “But he was a great friend  and once he considered you a friend  he was on your side for life.”
HLS Professor Roger Fisher dies,Roger D. Fisher ’43  LL.B. ’ 48  co-author of the perennial best-selling book “Getting to Yes” and the Williston Professor of LawEmeritusat Harvard University  died Aug. 25 in Hanover  N.H. He was 90 years old.Fisher was a pioneer in the field of international law and negotiation and the co-founder of theHarvard Negotiation Project. A professor at Harvard Law School for more than four decades  Fisher established negotiation and conflict resolution as a single field deserving academic study and devoted his career to challenging students and colleagues alike to explore alternative methods of dispute resolution.Harvard Law SchoolDean Martha Minowsaid: “Harvard Law School has been profoundly privileged to count Roger Fisher as a treasured colleague  teacher  and leader; the countless problems he solved  lives he changed  and negotiations he led or inspired are an awe-inspiring legacy.”Through analysis and writing  Fisher’s work laid the foundation on which much of the field of negotiation and conflict resolution has been based.His best-selling book  “Getting to Yes: Negotiating Without Giving In” (co-authored with William Ury in 1981)  has been translated into 23 languages and has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. Prior to the publication of “Getting to Yes ” there were almost no regular courses in negotiation taught at academic institutions. Now there are hundreds  if not thousands  of courses devoted to negotiation.“Through his writings and teaching  Roger Fisher’s seminal contributions literally changed the way millions of people around the world approach negotiation and dispute resolution ” said HLSProfessor Robert Mnookin ’68  chair of theProgram on Negotiation at Harvard Law Schooland director of the Harvard Negotiation Research Project (HNP). “He taught that conflict is not simply a ‘zero-sum’ game in which a fixed pie is simply divided through haggling or threats. Instead  he showed how by exploring underlying interests and being imaginative  parties could often expand the pie and create value.”In 1979  Fisher co-founded the Harvard Negotiation Project with Ury and Bruce Patton ’84  serving as the director. HNP’s mission is “to improve the theory and practice of conflict resolution and negotiation by working on real-world conflict intervention  theory building  education and training  and writing and disseminating new ideas.”Patton  who co-wrote the 1991 edition of “Getting to Yes” and is a Distinguished Fellow of the Harvard Negotiation Project  said Fisher’s legacy was much broader than his work on negotiation. “Roger sought to build a systematic toolbox for analyzing and diagnosing the causes of any disliked situation and finding practical  effective ways to move it toward a preferred state. Like a hard scientist  Roger believed that one could not build such tools (or teach them effectively) without being able to test and refine them in the crucible of practice.”According to Patton  Fisher’s efforts contributed directly and materially to multiple steps toward peace in the Middle East  including Sadat’s trip to Jerusalem  and the Camp David summit that led to an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty; peace in Central America and especially in El Salvador; the resolution of the longest-running war in the Western Hemisphere between Ecuador and Peru; the breakthrough that enabled resolution of the Iranian hostage conflict in 1980; a fundamental reshaping of the U.S.-Soviet relationship; and the negotiations and constitutional process that led to the end of apartheid in South Africa. (Read the full text of Pattons’ tributehere.) Fisher is also recognized as the intellectual father of the “West Point Negotiation Project ” which has trained Army officers and cadets to recognize conflicts and apply the tools of principled negotiation in both peace and war.Ury  a mediator for more than 30 years  said Fisher had a tremendous influence on students and colleagues. Ury said his own future was shaped by a seminal phone call from Fisher in 1977. As a graduate student in social anthropology  Ury received a call from Fisher praising Ury on his research paper  which proposed an anthropological study of the Middle East peace negotiations. Fisher told Ury that he liked his paper so much he sent it to the assistant secretary of state for the Middle East  and wanted Ury to work with him.“I was stunned. Never had I expected a professor to call me up  let alone invite me to collaborate  or see one of my ideas offered up for practical application ” said Ury. “Roger introduced me to the field of negotiation  taught and mentored me  and shaped my career more than anyone. It would be impossible for me to imagine my work without the inspiration and influence of Roger Fisher.“Robert C. Bordone ’97  the Thaddeus R. Beal Clinical Professor of Law and the director of theHarvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program  said: “Roger was a master at the art of perspective-taking  of understanding how deep human needs — to be heard  valued  respected  autonomous  and safe — when unmet or trampled upon  become seeds of evil and violence  seeds that can cause us to vilify each other  and that motivate us to see the world in stark black-and-white terms. For Roger  the purpose of perspective-taking was never to excuse or justify evil. Rather  it was a way to discover new approaches to diplomacy  to influence and to understanding.”During World War II  Fisher served in the U.S. Army Air Force in the North Atlantic and Pacific theaters as a weather reconnaissance observer. After discovering that his college roommate and two of his best friends were killed in the war  he dedicated most of his life to finding a better way to deal with the kind of differences that produce war.Fifty years after his graduation from Harvard College in 1943  Fisher wrote for his Class Report: “Since our freshman year  beginning in the fall of 1939 with World War II  the primary focus of my interest has been how the world copes with its conflicting values  perceptions  wants  and needs. After losing my roommate and some of my best friends in war  I knew we had to find a better way for people to deal with their differences.”After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1948  Fisher passed up a clerkship for Chief Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to move to Paris  where he worked on the Marshall Plan underW. Averell Harrimanuntil 1949.After returning to the United States  Fisher worked for the Washington  D.C.  law firm Covington & Burling from 1950 to 1956  with most of his work dealing with international issues. From 1956 to 1958  he served as an assistant to the U.S. solicitor general in the Department of Justice. In 1957  Fisher argued for the United States in Roth v. United States  a landmark obscenity case  and won.Fisher joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958 and became a full professor of law in 1960. In 1976  he became the Samuel Williston Professor of Law. In 1992  he was named a professoremeritus. He also taught at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government  the London School of Economics  the Naval War College  Air War College  and the NATO Defense College.During the 1960s  he served as a consultant to John McNaughton  assistant U.S. secretary of defense for international security affairs.Some of his suggestionsfor ways to end U.S. involvement in Vietnam are documented in “The Pentagon Papers.” Fisher went on to publish a critique of U.S. policy failures in Vietnam in his 1969 book “International Conflict for Beginners.”A strong advocate for using the medium of television as a means to disseminate both legal issues and current events to a broader audience  Fisher proposed the Peabody Award-winning television program “The Advocates” in 1969. The program focused on “stimulating public participation  and understanding  by focusing on realistic choices that must be made in the future  by having both sides of the question presented  and by demonstrating the interest that public officials have in both reasoned arguments and the views of their constituents.” Fisher served as executive producer from 1969 to 1974  and then again from 1978 to1979.In 1970  in connection with a segment of “The Advocates ” Fisher became the last Westerner to interview President Nasser of Egypt  and his questions elicited from Nasser an unexpected willingness to accept a ceasefire with Israel in the “war of attrition” then raging along the Suez Canal. Fisher brought the interview to the attention of Undersecretary of State Elliot Richardson ’47 and thus helped stimulate what became known as the Rogers Plan (named forNixon’s Secretary of State William Pierce Rogers)  which ultimately produced a ceasefire.Through the consulting firms of Conflict Management Inc. and Vantage Partners  and with the nonprofit Conflict Management Group (now part ofMercy Corps)  which he co-founded  Fisher taught and advised corporate executives  labor leaders  attorneys  diplomats  and military and government officials on settlement and negotiation strategy.This past April  Fisher was honored for his contributions to Harvard Law School and the field of negotiation with a celebration of his career there. The event also marked the opening of his papers in the Harvard Law School Library’s Historical and Special Collections. Thepapers  spanning 60 years of Fisher’s career as a lawyer and an academic  include such diverse materials as notes related to his books  as well as his work on the television series “The Advocates.”(See Fisher’s complete bibliographyhere.)For 62 years  Fisher was married to Caroline McMurtrie Speer  who died in 2010. He is survived by his two sons  Elliott S. Fisher (Harvard College ’74  Harvard Medical School  M.D. ’81  University of Washington  M.P.H. ’85)  professor of medicine and director for population health and policy at The Dartmouth Institute; and Peter R. Fisher (Harvard College ’80  Harvard Law School  J.D. ’85)  who worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and as undersecretary of the treasury  and is now senior managing director of BlackRock. He is also survived by two brothers  John V. Fisher (Harvard College  S.B. ’42) and Francis D. Fisher (Harvard College  A.B. ’47  Harvard Law School  J.D. ’51)  and five grandchildren.In 2002  at a celebration in honor of Fisher’s 80th birthday at Harvard  the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith said of his friend and colleague: “Whenever I thought  ‘Someone should do something about this ’ it eased my conscience to learn that Roger was already working on it.”A memorial service honoring Fisher’s life  work  and memory will be held on Oct. 27 at 11 a.m. in Appleton Chapel at the Memorial Church in Harvard Yard.
Harvard baseball coach dies,Joe Walsh  the Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 Head Coach for Harvard Baseball  died suddenly at his Chester  N.H.  home early this morning  theDepartment of Harvard Athleticsannounced today.Walsh served proudly in his self-professed “dream job” as Harvard’s baseball coach for the past 17 seasons  winning five Ivy League championships  according to Harvard Athletics.“This is a tragic day for everyone associated with Harvard athletics  Massachusetts baseball  and the larger baseball community ” said Nichols Family Director of AthleticsBob Scalise. “Joe’s passion for the game redefined success in the Ivy League and he positively impacted the lives of so many people. To say that he will be missed would be an understatement.”Walsh is survived by his wife  Sandra  and their four daughters  Tory  Holly  Katie  and Kasey.More information with funeral details will be forthcoming.A 1971 graduate of Catholic Memorial High School in Boston’s West Roxbury neighborhood  Walsh was a true son of “Southie.” He stayed local for his college baseball  playing at Suffolk University before graduating in 1976.Walsh’s first head coaching job came at his alma mater  taking the reins in the 1980-81 season. He remained at Suffolk for 15 years and was inducted into the school’s Athletic Hall of Fame in May 2009.In 1996  Walsh became Harvard’s first full-time  and first endowed  baseball coach. Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67  M.B.A. ’71  a former Harvard baseball and football letterwinner who is a long-time supporter of the College  established a $2.5 million endowment fund that supports the head baseball coach in much the same way that an endowed chair supports a professor.In 32 years as a college coach  Walsh posted a 569-564-3 record. He led Harvard to a school-record season in 1998 by going 36-12 with a final ranking of 24th nationally after leading the Crimson to victories over Tulane and Nicholls State at the NCAA South II Regional at LSU.That success followed his 1997 campaign when he took Harvard to a 34-16 overall record. After claiming its first Ivy title since 1985 with a League-best 18-2 Ivy mark  the Crimson made an impressive showing in the NCAA Midwest Regional at Oklahoma State where Walsh’s sixth-seeded club handed top-seeded (and fourth-ranked) UCLA an opening-round loss and then eliminated Stetson in the second round. Walsh was named the 1997 and 1998 Northeast Region Division I Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association.His involvement in the renowned Cape Cod League dates back to 1988  when he was the head coach of the Brewster Whitecaps. He served stints with the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox under legendary head coach Don Reed and  from 1991 to 1998  served as the pitching coach for the Wareham Gatemen.In addition to coaching on Cape Cod  Walsh was a regular at Fenway Park throwing batting practice. He also ran baseball camps and clinics throughout New England as the Play To Win Baseball Camp.
Horace Gray Lunt II,At the end of his first year at Harvard in 1937–1938  Horace Lunt decided to concentrate in Russian studies but was counseled by his faculty adviser  Samuel Hazzard Cross  to stay with German instead because in Russian “there is no chance for a job.”  Lunt graduated in German in 1941 but had been bitten by the Russian bug.  He went on to become one of the world’s leading experts in Slavic philology and linguistics.Horace Gray Lunt II  Samuel Hazzard Cross Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures  Emeritus  at Harvard University  passed away on August 11  2010  in Baltimore  Maryland.  At Harvard he had been a member of the Slavic Department faculty from 1949 to 1989 and had served as its chair from 1959 to 1974.After receiving an M.A. in Russian at the University of California  Berkeley  in 1942  he was drafted into the army.  His aptitude for languages earned him an assignment to the Counter Intelligence Corps  and ultimately a stint in Italy interviewing Yugoslav refugees while improving his knowledge of Serbian  Croatian  and Slovene.  In 1946 he met the eminent émigré philologist and structural linguist Roman Jakobson  a figure who would have a profound effect on the entire trajectory of his career.  Following a year-long stay in Prague to study Czech  Lunt entered the Ph.D. program at Columbia in the fall of 1947 to study under Jakobson’s supervision.  When Jakobson moved to Harvard in 1949 to join the newly founded Slavic Department  he brought Lunt with him as an assistant professor.  A golden age of Slavic studies was about to commence  and it would be the Harvard Slavic Department  with the addition of a number of distinguished  mostly émigré  scholars to its faculty  that would fundamentally alter the field by training scores of new American Slavists to take up college and university posts across the nation over the next several decades  especially after the launching of Sputnik in 1957.Lunt’s beginnings at Harvard were largely devoted to creating new course materials for teaching the Russian language and Old Church Slavonic (OCS)  the oldest written form of Slavic  whose mastery is vital for Slavic studies.  His efforts resulted in the publication of his Old Church Slavonic Grammar (1955) and his Fundamentals of Russian (1957).  Old Church Slavonic Grammar  now in its seventh revised edition (2001)  remains one of the best OCS grammars in any language because of its comprehensive coverage  its clarity of explanation  and its rich exemplification.Lunt’s meticulous attention to detail was nowhere more evident than in his signature course  “Old Church Slavonic ” typically taken by first-year graduate students.  Unlike many instructors who introduced a few Gospel selections at the end of the term  Lunt presented a brief overview of the grammar and then immediately plunged students into the reading and analysis of the texts themselves.  It was a baptism of fire that was both intimidating and salutary  eliciting strongly positive reactions from both linguistic and literature students  who viewed Lunt’s OCS class as one of the most intensive  well organized  and analytically stimulating courses they had ever taken.Developing an earlier interest in the newly official Macedonian language of Yugoslavia  Lunt produced A Grammar of the Macedonian Literary Language in 1952  the first such work in English.  The grammar sparked the ire of Bulgarian nationalists  who viewed Macedonian as a western dialect of Bulgarian.  A Bulgarian newspaper that denounced Yugoslav language policies and sharply criticized all attempts to establish a standard Macedonian language stated that “the hapless Yugoslavs were obliged to import a spy to create the language for them.  We need no help from any Horace Lunts!”  “Luntism” was designated an anti-Bulgarian scourge.  Lunt later recalled “feeling flattered at the powers attributed to me  and rather pleased at the notion of a political heresy named after me.” The Greeks  on the contrary  were outraged that the name Macedonian could be assigned to a non-Greek tongue and its people.  Both disputes rage on to this day.  Lunt refused to remain silent on such matters  readily dismantling the flimsy arguments of those manipulating linguistic and historical facts to stifle the cultural  political  and linguistic authenticity of minority ethnic groups.In September 1973  Omeljan Pritsak  the Director of the newly founded Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard  suggested convening a weekly seminar to discuss Lunt’s ongoing translation of the Primary Chronicle  the most important source for the early history of the East Slavs. Lunt would pre-circulate several pages of translation  which would be evaluated on the basis of the most recent edition published in 1950 by the doyen of Soviet medievalists  Dmitrii Likhachev.  The seminar met faithfully every week for six straight years and was attended by the major figures of Slavic medieval studies at Harvard: Ihor Ševčenko (Byzantine studies)  Edward Keenan (East Slavic history)  Pritsak (Turkic studies and East European history and geography)  and Lunt.  A single sentence  phrase  or even word could ignite an arcane interchange of expert opinion with the result that often no more than a half page of Lunt’s translation would be covered in a session  though only the occasional tweaks were recommended in the end.  Lunt served as senior consultant for a new reconstruction of the Primary Chronicle that appeared in 2003.  Weeks before his death  he gave final approval to the text of his nearly four-decades-long translation project  now slated for publication by the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute.Lunt was promoted from assistant professor to associate professor in 1954 and received a tenured full professorship in 1960  the same year he was named a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow.  In 1973 he succeeded Roman Jakobson as the Samuel Hazzard Cross Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures  an ironic reconnection to the very mentor who had advised him to steer clear of Russian as a field of concentration.  He is survived by Sally Herman Lunt  his wife of forty-seven years  daughters Elizabeth Gray Lunt and Catherine Lunt Greer  son-in-law David S. Friedman  and five grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Patricia Rowe ChaputMorris Halle (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)Edward L. KeenanMichael S. Flier  Chair
Oleg Grabar,The Islamic art and architecture community mourned the loss of one of the field’s most influential and insightful scholars. Oleg Grabar  professor emeritus of the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study  and Aga Khan Professor  Emeritus  at Harvard University  passed away at his home in Princeton  New Jersey  on January 8  2011  at the age of eighty-one. Professor Grabar  who taught in the Harvard Department of Fine Arts (now History of Art and Architecture) for twenty-one years (1969–1990)  was instrumental in founding Harvard’s Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture. There are few  if any  Islamicists who have not profited from the scholarly contributions of this extraordinary man  who was larger-than-life. He was the first Aga Khan Professor of Islamic Art at Harvard (1980–1990)  and subsequently joined the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  where he remained active in research and publication until his second retirement in 1998  and over the following thirteen years as well. Grabar’s continuing post-retirement intellectual productivity and capacity to inspire were officially recognized when he received the Chairman’s Award from the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in Doha in 2010.Oleg Grabar was born in Strasbourg  France  in 1929. As the son of André Grabar  the eminent historian of Byzantine art  he was raised almost from the cradle to be an art historian. Thanks to that upbringing  he harbored a special fascination with the Byzantine and late antique heritage of the Mediterranean world. This fascination extended to his explorations of early Islamic art at the beginning of his career  with seventh- to eighth-century Umayyad architecture forming the core of his scholarship  even when it broadened later on to embrace a much wider spectrum.Grabar’s early education in France was followed by an A.B. magna cum laude in Medieval History from Harvard University in 1950. He continued his higher education at Princeton University  where he began to develop a passion for Islamic art  obtaining his M.A. (1953) and Ph.D. (1955) in Oriental Languages and Literatures and the History of Art.In 1969  Grabar joined the Harvard faculty as Professor of Fine Arts and was the first ever to teach Islamic art at the University. Always generous to students and colleagues  he was also a thoughtful faculty member of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. His wide-ranging and substantial knowledge of the Middle East — not only its art and architecture but also its peoples  cultures  and history — gave him a magisterial perspective on possibilities for lecturers  projects  and thematic emphases for Center programs. As a teacher  he would mesmerize students with his flamboyant  exciting  and always substantive lectures. His remarkable charisma derived largely from his contagious enthusiasm for challenging intellectual problems and for the subject matter and questions he was addressing at any given time.Grabar wrote more than 20 books and 120 articles. He was primarily a medievalist  but his publications covered a wide range of subjects  including early Islamic architecture  the architecture of Jerusalem under Islamic rule  Arabic and Persian painting  and Islamic ornament. Among his best-known books are “The Formation of Islamic Art” (1973)  “The Illustrations of the Maqamat” (1984)  “The Art and Architecture of Islam 650–1250” (co-authored with Richard Ettinghausen  1987)  and “The Shape of the Holy: Early Islamic Jerusalem” (1996).Grabar’s seminal work  “The Formation of Islamic Art ” is perhaps the masterpiece among his innumerable publications and remains a classic. This sophisticated and inspired work grew from his early studies on the origins of Islamic art. In one obituary  it was judged “more a work of cultural than art history ” springing as it does “from a deeper familiarity with the thought-world of early medieval Islam than any of today’s Islamic art historians possess ” and revealing that he was “more interested in ideas and context than in the close-focus study of surface detail or indeed the objects themselves as works of art.” Grabar prided himself precisely on this methodological approach. He succinctly distinguished his approach from that of Professor Ettinghausen — a contemporary luminary in the field  whom he admired and collaborated with in the preparation of their highly influential survey of Islamic art and architecture — in the advice he gave to one prospective graduate student: “If you wish to start with ideas and then choose relevant objects  come here to Harvard; but you should go to the Institute of Fine Arts if you prefer to move from objects to ideas.”The global reach of Grabar’s scholarly achievements had an impact not only on his own field but far beyond as well. He had a very special talent for making Islamic art and architecture seductive to nonspecialists  thereby vastly broadening the recognition of the field. He boldly posed sweeping questions about the nature  meaning  and dynamics of Islamic art at a time when very little was known about this subject. In addition to cultivating world-class advanced scholarship and research in the field of Islamic art  he asked questions that often challenged Euro-American perspectives more generally.Grabar’s creative approaches made the field appear wide open to hugely exciting questions of cultural and social history and aesthetics  captivating the minds of generations of scholars and amateurs alike. His mental agility and nondogmatic flexibility made him an extraordinarily inspiring mentor. He would encourage graduate students to work on entirely unexplored subjects because he was deeply concerned about shaping the parameters of a field whose rapid expansion both pleased and worried him.Grabar trained scores of students  many of whom went on to become leading scholars  educators  and curators around the world  particularly in the United States. He brought passion and vision to his work  and his expansive personality  generosity of spirit  collegiality  conviviality  and humor were truly infectious.  Grabar’s resounding impact on expanding the scope of the Islamic field far beyond its former spatial and temporal limits will be his lasting legacy.Oleg Grabar is greatly missed and the field will not be the same without him.Respectfully submitted William GrahamThomas LentzDavid RoxburghGülru Necipoğlu  Chair

Oscar Handlin,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on March 6  2012  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Oscar Handlin  Carl M. Loeb University Professor  Emeritus  was the most influential and creative historian of American social life in the second half of the twentieth century.  Born in Brooklyn  New York  the son of Russian Jewish immigrants  steeped in the lore and learning of Jewish culture  he developed in his youngest years a passion for learning—learning  as he wrote again and again  for its own sake  simply to know and understand the world and its people.  It was that passion that led him into and out of a Yeshiva in Brooklyn  through his studies at Brooklyn College  through years of encyclopedic reading in the Brooklyn and New York Public Libraries  and that led him finally to Harvard  which he considered the national citadel of learning.He entered the Harvard graduate school in 1934  at age 18  and after receiving his doctorate under the direction of Professor Arthur Schlesinger  Sr.  in 1940  except for two years of teaching in Brooklyn  he taught at Harvard until his retirement.  It is an indication of the early recognition of his talents that his first appointment at Harvard (1945) was as Instructor  then Assistant Professor in Social Science  approved by the History  Psychology  and Sociology Departments.  By then the publication in 1941 of his dissertation on Boston’s immigrants  1790-1865  had begun a stream of writings—at least forty books written or edited and innumerable articles and reviews—that lasted for over four decades.  His Commonwealth: a Study of the Role of Government in the American Economy: Massachusetts 1774-1816 (1947)  written with his wife Mary F. Handlin  is a master work of technical scholarship that revealed  at a time when much of the economy was organized at a local level and democratic impulses had made widely accessible the instruments of state action  the forceful role of government that federalism had misled many to think did not exist.  Four years later his lyric  evocative The Uprooted (1951)—with its famous opening “Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America.  Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history”—won the Pulitzer Prize and carried readers  as no work of history had done before  into the interior  emotional world of immigrant experiences.  It stimulated a generation’s interest in the passages of uprooted people through the tortuous strains of resettlement and assimilation.It was his love of learning for its own sake  and of Harvard as the embodiment of it  that made the assault on the University in 1969 and 1970 such a bitter experience for him.  He could understand why students might try to turn the University into a political instrument.  They were ignorant.  And he could understand why political activists unaffiliated with Harvard might do so.  But he could never understand why some of his own colleagues  committed as he was to impartial scholarship and to the integrity of the University  would do so.  It was a savage blow to everything he believed in  and he never fully recovered from it.He was unique in his understanding and explanation of history.  It was not for him an assemblage of information but a form of intellection  a cognitive process  which he expressed year after year in his books and articles and in the classroom.  His lectures were unique.  They contained little descriptive information.  They were analyses of the structures of events and developments and the configurations they formed that explained how things came to be the way they were.  The lectures were dense  the logic tight  and they were difficult for many to grasp.  Yet they were popular—at one point too popular for him.  When attendance in his American Social History class topped 400  he dropped it.  “I did not believe ” he wrote “that an earnest desire for that kind of knowledge really moved that many undergraduates; and I feared that these lectures had become one of those experiences into which people drifted out of habit or reputation.  Therefore I chose subjects which on the face of it were not likely to draw crowds . . . and I offered my courses at an hour that required students either to postpone or skip their lunch.”He was unique too in his sheer competence.  His services to the University were extraordinary. While lecturing to undergraduates  he directed the graduate work of 80 doctoral candidates  whom he drove on  inspired  and protected  contacting socially many in other fields than his own for whom he had no formal responsibility; they all felt that he cared about their interests and would do what he could for their emerging careers.  An excellent administrator  he was a dominant force in the affairs of the History Department  served as the Harvard University Librarian (1979-1984)  and began the Library’s modernization.  In a crisis he took over the Directorship of the Harvard University Press (1972).  He founded and directed the Warren Center for Studies in American History as well as his own Center for the Study of the History of Liberty in America. And he was equally active outside the University.  He was a co-founder of a new television station and became a TV commentator.  He served as Fulbright Commissioner  as an Overseer of Brandeis University  a Trustee of the New York Public Library  and he testified in Congress  with great effect  for the reform of American immigration policy.In his last years  with the assistance of his devoted second wife  the historian Lilian Bombach  with whom he wrote the four-volume conclusion to his study of the history of liberty in America as well as several other books  he continued his daily visits to his Widener study.  He died in September 2011  aged 95  having lived a life of true learning  devoted to its transmission to generations of students and to the public at large.Respectfully submitted Robert DarntonRichard PipesStephan ThernstromBernard Bailyn  Chair
Dorrit Cohn  literature scholar  87,Dorrit Cohn’45  Ernest Bernbaum Professor of LiteratureEmeritus died on March 10. She was 87.Cohn came to Harvard in 1971. A scholar of German and comparative literature  Cohn was one of three women appointed to theFaculty of Arts and Sciences(FAS) in 1971. (Prior to that year  FAS had tenured only four other women in its history.) During a long academic career that began atIndiana Universityin 1964 and ran through her retirement in 1995  she won a number of honors  including a prestigiousGuggenheim Fellowship(1970-71)  the Radcliffe Graduate Society Medal (1982)  and the Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Award (1984).Cohn’s scholarship included work on formal devices in narrative and the difference between fiction and nonfiction. Her book “Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction” (1978) was hailed as “one of the most important contributions to the understanding of fiction in the last decade ” byUniversity of Torontoprofessor and literary scholar Henry Weinberg. Her 1998 book “The Distinction of Fiction” won the Modern Language Association of America’sAldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prizefor Comparative Literature Studies.“Dorrit Cohn’s ‘Transparent Minds’ was a breakthrough work  a brilliant meditation on how fiction enables us to read the minds of others ” said Maria Tatar  the John L. Loeb Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures. “A high-wattage analysis of narrative technique  it continues to exert a powerful influence on many disciplines outside the field of literary studies.  The prize-winning ‘Distinction of Fiction’ instructed us about the tripwire alerts in the borderland between fiction and history. Dorrit Cohn understood the wizardry of words at a profound level and made it her life’s work to demystify it  even as she appreciated and preserved it.”Born in Vienna in 1924  Cohn’s family left Austria days before Nazi takeover  traveled for a year  and immigrated to the United States in 1939. She received a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1945 and a master’s degree in comparative literature in 1946  both from Radcliffe College. Cohn studied comparative literature atYaleand  after an 11-year hiatus  completed her Ph.D. in German at Stanford. She began teaching at Indiana University soon after.Cohn spent her final years in Durham  N.C.  where she continued to write and translate scholarly works. In 2011 she won theWayne C. Booth Lifetime Achievement Award  which “recognizes outstanding scholar-teachers who have made sustained contributions to narrative studies over the course of their careers.”Wernor Sollors  Henry B. and Anne M. Cabot Professor of English Literature and professor of African and African American studies  was a longtime colleague of Cohn. He mourned her passing and remembered her as a good friend and a sharp wit.“Dorrit was a great conversationalist  both witty and warm ” said Wernor Sollors  Henry B. and Anne M. Cabot Professor of English Literature and professor of African and African American studies. “Whether she commented on a famous lecture by referring to it ironically as ‘narratology for the masses’ or noted in a committee meeting  with a skeptical glance  that some readers do like to believe that great artists also have admirable political views  she often quipped memorably and was ready to puncture many myths of the academic tribe  in person as well as in print.”Dorrit Cohn is survived by her sons Richard L. Cohn  the Battell Professor of Music Theory at Yale University  and Stephen Cohn of Durham  N.C.  as well as four grandchildren.An on-campus memorial service celebrating the life of Professor Dorrit Cohn is currently being organized.
Ronold W. P. King,Ronold Wyeth Percival King was born on September 19  1905  in Williamstown  Massachusetts  where his father was a professor of German at Williams College.  He received a B.S. degree in physics from the University of Rochester in 1927.  Under a German-American Fellowship  he studied in Munich and then received a master’s degree in 1929 from the University of Rochester and earned a Ph.D. in 1932 from the University of Wisconsin.  After two more years at Wisconsin doing research  King moved to Lafayette College in Easton  Pennsylvania  to serve as an instructor in physics.  In the spring of 1936  Professor E. L. Chaffee  who headed a group in Communication Engineering in the Graduate School of Engineering at Harvard  searched out Dr. King as successor to Professor G. W. Pierce  who was retiring. In 1938 King returned from a year-long Guggenheim Fellowship in Germany to become an instructor in the School of Engineering at Harvard.  He retired from Harvard as Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics in 1972  but stayed many years beyond  remaining active and productive until after his one-hundredth birthday.Over the course of his career King produced 12 books and more than 300 journal articles in the field of applied electromagnetics in specialized areas related to antennas.  His lectures and publications make the word “thorough” seem like a gross understatement.  Fortunately he usually began with a physical description of the problem followed by a rigorous theory containing a large variety of symbols.  His giant and intimidating volume  The Theory of Linear Antennas  was used to train most of his students.  Without taking the antenna course  AP 234  you could never be a true King antenna person.  He could spend an entire lecture explaining a concept that others would dash off in five minutes.In many areas of electrical engineering  Maxwell’s equations would form the basis for King’s theoretical treatment.  Generally he would add experimental results carried out by his students. Many of his journal publications were co-authored with the students and  in an efficient process  were ultimately incorporated into his books.  Other areas to which King made major contributions were antennas over and in earth and water and the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation.  During the war he taught courses in the Harvard Radar School and pre-Radar School.According to King himself  his greatest achievement was the 101 graduate students who wrote their Ph.D. dissertations under his guidance  including one father-son pair: John and George Fikioris.  His large body of students referred to him as “Professor King” even after they themselves became professors.  In spite of this formality  his Ph.D. students enjoyed a relationship with him that was both familial and collegial.  Students regularly had lunch with him at the lab and were invited to dinners at his house in Winchester.  He took equal interest in outstanding students and those in need of help of any kind.  His students honored him with the Golden Dipole Award at his retirement dinner in 1972 and celebrated milestones with him regularly up to and including his one-hundredth birthday.King received many awards for contributions to research and education.  In 1984 he received the IEEE Centennial Medal; in 1986 the Harold Pender Award from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania; in 1991 the IEEE Distinguished Achievement Award of the Antennas and Propagation Society  the citation for which stated: “To Ronold W.P. King for over a half century of outstanding contributions to the field of electromagnetics particularly in the area of linear antennas; for the exemplary standards in research and teaching and  above all  for a lifetime of dedication to his students.” One award that made him particularly proud was being elected to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.King married Justine Merrell in 1937  and their son  Christopher  was born in 1941. After Justine’s death in 1990  he married Mary Govoni in 1991. King’s personal life is hard to separate from his public life as professor and researcher.  He spent most of his summers  from boyhood on  at his family’s oceanfront cottage in Rockport  Maine.It was a classic wooden cottage with a wood stove that kept his family from freezing on cold and foggy Maine days.  When he was an undergraduate he took on the job of wiring his family’s farm in Waldoboro  Maine.  He designed the systems himself and bought all the parts from Sears Roebuck.  No soldering in the walls was allowed  so he had to have exact lengths to put in conduit.  With the help of his younger brother  Don  the job took two summers to complete  but he said  “It made electricity very real.  In a small way it was the beginning of my long career in electromagnetic theory.”  When he observed that boats often had a hard time navigating Rockport Harbor in the fog  he devised and published a paper on a beacon antenna array system to guide the boats.Much can be said of Ronold King’s life work: his energetic commitment to his 101 Ph.D. advisees; his skill at conveying a deep physical understanding of a problem; his extraordinary analytical abilities and experimental prowess.  King’s success as a teacher also benefited from a unique talent for choosing words and crafting sentences to communicate complex and subtle ideas.  His writing was as precise as his science  and both were exceptionally deep and elegant.In addition  Professor King’s industry was truly remarkable.  How many individuals reach the age of 90 and have 30 more scientific  peer-reviewed papers and one more comprehensive technical book yet to write and publish?Professor King’s students and colleagues have greatly admired his long life and many accomplishments.  Most complimentary of all  many have modeled their lives after his fine example.Respectfully submitted Frederick H.

Allan R. Robinson,Allan R. Robinson  Gordon McKay Professor of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics  Emeritus  died suddenly on September 25  2009  at his summer home overlooking Buzzards Bay.  Professor Robinson established and  for nearly four decades almost single-handedly ran  a graduate program in physical oceanography in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.  Many of his nearly 30 Ph.D. students and 25 postdoctoral fellows hold leadership positions at major universities and research centers.Allan was known throughout the world of oceanography for his insightful contributions to understanding the Gulf Stream  the evolution of ocean eddies (the oceanic equivalent of weather)  and the dynamics of circulation in the Mediterranean Sea.  In the early 1980s he demonstrated that ocean current forecasting was possible and developed the Harvard Ocean Prediction System  a uniquely portable forecasting and analysis tool that is still widely used.  He then successfully connected this methodology to practical applications in fisheries  search and rescue  and national defense.Allan was born in Lynn  Massachusetts  and grew up a few blocks from the coast in Marblehead.  As a student he excelled in science and began his lifetime interest in art  literature  and music.  Like many in his community  he was drawn to the sea.He enrolled in 1950 at Harvard College  where he enjoyed courses in physics and math and played baritone horn with the Harvard Band.  During commencement week in 1953 Allan and his friends Edward Upton and Charles Lipson decided to write a set of nonsense Latin verses for “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.”  Today when the Harvard Band sings one can occasionally still hear “Illigitimi non carborundum  Domine salvum fac regem.”  During Allan’s memorial service in Memorial Church the band sang his lyrics — he would have loved it.As Allan contemplated possible career directions in physics  he was guided by a desire to make a fundamental contribution to theory.  He began his dissertation research on nuclear shell theory  but midway through this work he was invited by Columbus O’Donnell Iselin  who was the Director of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at the time  to join a regular discussion among a small group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and Woods Hole scientists who were attempting to reconcile ocean observations with fundamental physical processes.  Around this time  under the tutelage of George Carrier  Allan’s Ph.D. research was shifting to theoretical ocean processes.  This work was highly novel: only 14 prior publications are cited in his dissertation  and his studies led to more than half a dozen papers in prestigious scientific journals. After completing his Ph.D. Allan spent a year as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge University’s Cavendish Laboratory with luminaries in fluid dynamics such as G. I. Taylor and George Batchelor.  Allan returned to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1960 and was subsequently promoted to associate and then the Gordon McKay Professor of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics in 1968.In the early 1960s Allan’s elegant analysis of vorticity conservation over a sloping sea floor led to the discovery of continental shelf waves  a term he coined.  Next Allan spearheaded a number of ship-based explorations designed to study the performance of his ocean current models when compared to observed currents and water properties. With Henry Stommel he co-directed the Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment and co-chaired the US POLYMODE Organizing Committee  the latter of which involved extensive collaboration with Soviet physical oceanographers.  These studies provided the first comprehensive overview of turbulent ocean “weather” that is analogous to the high and low pressure systems that influence atmospheric weather.In the 1980s Allan launched a successful basin-scale modeling project of the eastern Mediterranean Sea that for the first time correctly depicted ocean current structures  which led to new research on the connections between ocean eddies and gyre circulation in the Mediterranean Sea.While theoretical studies employing elegant mathematics were always dear to Allan’s heart  he also thought that scientists have an obligation to address societal problems.  Allan’s understanding of the physics of eddies and his novel application of quantitative forecasting methods were highly valued by the U.S. Navy in its operational work relating to submarine detection.  He took pleasure in the deference paid him by military leaders  such as when they delivered via a navy submarine an instrument he needed on a research vessel.  Admiral Peter Cressy (Ret.) said  “From extensive personal observation . . . I can state . . . that [Professor Robinson’s] contributions were essential to our national defense and a key component of the successful conclusion of the cold war.”  In 1991 the Office of Naval Research awarded Allan its Distinguished Educator’s Award in Ocean Science  in recognition of his many contributions to national security.Allan served for many years as the editor of the journal Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans  and as editor-in-chief of the prestigious occasional series THE SEA  overseeing the production of six volumes.  He retired from teaching in 2002 and from his research professorship in 2007.  Over his professional career Allan wrote or edited over 150 research articles and books.  He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Geophysical Union and received honorary degrees from the University of Liege and the University of Massachusetts.  In recognition of his contributions to important societal problems  he received the Award for the Merits of Two Worlds from the European Institute of Cultural Integration.It would be fair to say that over the last half century no single physical oceanographer was more important than Allan in advancing the intellectual underpinning of interdisciplinary ocean science. In his later years he completed some of a projected series of influential papers on the theory of physical-biological interactions.  Allan’s sudden death was a shock to all who knew him.  He was as mentally active as ever  authoring papers  exploring new research ideas  and laying plans for new edited volumes.  His friends and close collaborators quite simply expected him to continue this way forever.  He is survived by his spouse  Marguerite; their three daughters  Sarah Penelope Robinson  Perrine Robinson-Geller  and Laura Ondine Robinson; six grandchildren; and his sister  Gladys Meltzer.Respectfully submitted Frederick H.

Michael Tinkham,Michael Tinkham  Rumford Professor of Physics and Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics in the Physics Department and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  Emeritus  who was internationally known for his contributions to condensed matter physics  in particular superconductivity  died in Portland  Oregon  on November 4  2010  of complications following a stroke.  He was 82 years old.Mike was an experimental physicist with a gift for theory and a nose for important challenging problems.  After graduating from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1951 with a bachelor’s degree in physics  he proceeded to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  where he received his master’s degree and Ph.D. in just three years.  His thesis  “Theory of the Fine Structure of the Molecular Oxygen Ground State with an Experimental Study of its Microwave Paramagnetic Spectrum ” was published in 1955.  He changed his interests from gaseous magnetic oxygen to the understanding of properties in solids with a classic study of magnetic properties of transition metal ions in a diamagnetic lattice as a postdoctoral fellow at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford University from 1954-1955.  Mike then moved to the University of California in Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow in 1955  and joined the faculty there in 1957.At Berkeley Mike wrote his first book  Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1964).  His research was predominantly in superconductivity and magnetism.  This was an era when the understanding of superconductivity in metals was just emerging after many decades of study and lack of understanding.  Together with Rolf Glover III  a fellow postdoc  he set up a laboratory and measured the absorption/transmission of far infrared light passing through thin superconducting films. The remarkable result was that more light passed through the films in the superconducting state than in the higher temperature normal metal phase.  The far IR measurements as a function of frequency showed the existence of the superconducting energy gap.  These observations preceded the just-developing Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BCS) theory of superconductivity and were key evidence in support of the theory.  His double-pronged research group in superconductivity and magnetism created an exciting environment  and Berkeley was an important stop for travelling scientists to visit Mike and his group and observe the latest findings.  In 1974 Mike was awarded the Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society for outstanding theoretical or experimental contributions to condensed matter physics based upon that work.In 1966 Mike accepted an offer from the Physics Department at Harvard University  where he spent the rest of his career.  Superconductivity continued as the main focus of his research.  His deep understanding of superconductivity led him to write his second book  Introduction to Superconductivity (1975)  which clearly elucidated the subtle mysteries of the subject and has become a classic in the field.  In the early seventies  together with his postdocs and students  he made important advances in understanding the effect of thermal fluctuations on broadening the transition between superconducting and normal states.  With his deep understanding of the subtle theoretical underpinnings of superconductivity  he led a research activity to study many properties of the superconducting state.  With members of his group he applied those ideas to phase-slip centers  current flow across the superconductor-normal interface  and the subharmonic energy-gap structure in superconducting metallic weak links.  Mike moved with the times.  At Harvard he led in the development of the first central labs for producing materials on a nanoscopic level.  He and his group studied submicron tunnel junctions capacitively coupled to minute islands  the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in arrays of Josephson junctions  and tiny metallic whiskers grown on carbon nanotubes.Until his retirement Mike maintained a large active research group.  Graduate students were attracted to him for his ability to make complex ideas seem simple and to offer thesis problems on the leading edge of the field.  He encouraged his students to explore new directions  giving them full freedom to follow their own ideas and develop as creative scientists.  He hungered for data from his labs and had an uncanny talent for transforming scraps of experimental data into an ever-deeper understanding of superconductivity.  Over 45 students received their Ph.D.s under Mike’s tutelage.  His well-trained students and postdocs easily found positions at leading universities and research laboratories.Mike loved good food  good wine  and special desserts  sampling them all over the world.  His students were devoted and had an annual “Tinkham Dinner” at the March meeting of the American Physical Society.  Throughout most of his career he was quite formal and wore a coat and tie for most occasions  sometimes with a funny cap for the Boston weather.  But this attire did not hinder his fun with his students.  A special Science Center lecture to the interested public was advertised by a large colorful sign titled “Superconductivity” only to be doctored by his students on the night of the presentation to read “Sex and Superconductivity.”  He once walked into his lab where some of his students were having lunch and was upset to find that none of the homemade electronics were labeled. He demanded that everything in the lab be labeled for the next generation. The next day he found all the equipment duly labeled and his students sitting with bowed heads.  When they were asked to look up  Mike saw five foreheads labeled “Graduate Student.”Mike is survived by his wife  Mary Tinkham  his sons  Jeff and Chris  and two grandchildren  all now living in Portland  Oregon.  His colleagues and students  deeply saddened by his passing  will always remember his warmth  friendliness  and enthusiasm  as well as the depth of understanding and insights he brought to physics.Respectfully submitted Venkatesh NarayanamurtiRobert M.

Music scholar  John Milton Ward  94,John Milton Ward  Harvard’s William Powell Mason Professor of Music from 1961 to 1985  died quietly at home in Cambridge on Dec. 12. He was 94 years old.Ward joined the faculty of Harvard in 1955. Each undergraduate music concentrator took his chronological survey  while every graduate student in musicology took Music 200  which met once a week. Ward’s research interests were wide-ranging.  Initially a specialist in Renaissance music  Elizabethan music in general  and English popular and folk music from the 16th century to the present day  he eventually taught courses in film music and music in ritual. After he became increasingly involved with ethnomusicology  he taught several groundbreaking classes in the field. Materials related to this field were scarce in Harvard’s libraries  so he founded the Archive of World Music  which began with recordings from his collection. He also established the Charles Seeger Room  which contains all the ethnomusicological volumes in theEda Kuhn Loeb Music Library.After Ward retired from Harvard  his long-standing fascination with opera  ballet  operetta  vaudeville  and social dance led him to form extensive new collections. He donated what he had gathered to theHarvard Theatre Collectionof Houghton Library.Predeceased by his wife  Ruth Neils Ward  Ward is survived by his sister-in-law  Margaret Padelford  of Seattle  11 nieces and nephews  and countless friends.
Former A.R.T. resident director dies,TheAmerican Repertory Theater(A.R.T.) learned with great sorrow of the loss David Wheeler  longtime resident director and later associate artist. Wheeler died Wednesday at the age of 86.Since 1982  when Wheeler directed his first production — Sam Shepard’s “True West” — at the A.R.T.  he created more than 20 productions  including most memorably his productions of Shaw and Pinter  including “Misalliance” and “Man and Superman ” “The Homecoming ” “The Caretaker ” and most recently “No Man’s Land ” which featured his son Lewis Wheeler  and his longtime collaborator  the also recently departed Paul Benedict.A.R.T. Founding Director Robert Brustein said  “As director of the Theatre Company of Boston  David Wheeler was one of the founding fathers of postwar American theater and his influence on the American Repertory Theater has been incalculable. He was a particular master of American and English contemporary plays to which he added his customary humanity and humor. He will be sorely missed.”A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane Paulus concurred: “It was with great sadness that we learned of David Wheeler’s passing. He was a wonderful and visionary director who helped shape many seasons at the American Repertory Theater and in Boston’s theater community. As a teacher here at Harvard  he mentored hundreds of students. Most importantly he was a friend to all of us at the theater.”The A.R.T. planned to honor Wheeler with the annual Robert Brustein Award at its gala on Feb. 13  and intends to present it posthumously to his family at a separate memorial event to be held at the Loeb Drama Center. The date will be announced shortly.

Charles M. Williams dies at 94,Harvard Business School (HBS) ProfessorEmeritusCharles M. Williams  a renowned authority on commercial banking and a master of the art of case method teaching who influenced the lives and careers of thousands of M.B.A. students and executives around the world  died of congestive heart failure on Nov. 17  at the North Hill retirement community in Needham  Mass. He was 94 years old.At the time of his death  Williams was the School’s George Gund Professor of Commercial BankingEmeritus. From 1960 to 1966  he had served as the Edmund Cogswell Converse Professor of Finance and Banking.During his distinguished career  Williams established himself as “one of the great case teachers and promoters of the case method at Harvard Business School ” said Samuel L. Hayes III  the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment BankingEmeritus. “He was dynamic and effective in making problems come alive in the classroom.”More than two dozen of his students went on to join the HBS faculty  including Hayes and former Dean John H. McArthur Jr.  who once observed  “As a teacher  researcher  author  wise counsel  and good friend  Charlie Williams has had an enormous impact over the years on all of us at HBS as well as upon the entire banking industry.”According to Stephen A. Greyser  the School’s Richard P. Chapman Professor of Business AdministrationEmeritus  “Charlie Williams was one of the most influential HBS professors during his tenure on the faculty. At our 50th M.B.A. reunion  we surveyed the Class and voted him first among professors who had had an impact on our careers.”Williams joined the Harvard Business School faculty in 1947 and retired from the active faculty in 1986 after a long association with the School that began when he was an M.B.A. student from 1937 to 1939. He initially taught in the required first-year finance course and then moved on to teach his signature class  “Management of Financial Institutions ” one of the School’s most popular second-year M.B.A. electives. His two sections of the course were consistently oversubscribed.Charles Marvin Williams was born on April 20  1917  in Romney  W.Va.  He received his first lessons in banking from his father  a local banker who had lived through the Great Depression and who passed on to his son a sterling sense of integrity. “My father ” Williams once said  “gave me a respect for the fundamentals: Know your customers and work with them.”Williams earned his bachelor’s degree in history and economics at Washington and Lee University and graduated in three years as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Accepted by Harvard’s M.B.A. program at the age of 19  he earned his degree in 1939 and worked for two years in the loan department at Manufacturers Trust in New York City before volunteering for active duty in the U.S. Navy.Commissioned as an ensign  he found himself back in Boston in the U.S. Navy Supply Corps School  which was located on the HBS campus. He was then assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Lexington as a paymaster. In May 1942  the carrier was sunk by the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea.Williams then returned to the United States and was assigned to shore duty  which included teaching in the Naval Supply Corps School at Harvard and then a new posting in the Pacific. His academic career was launched in earnest just by chance. Assigned to teach in a Navy ROTC program at the University of Michigan  he asked the dean if he could take some courses in the graduate business school in his spare time. Instead  the dean drafted Williams to teach 150 students business and finance. After a year at Michigan and a discharge from the Navy in 1947  Williams joined the HBS faculty as an assistant professor. He earned his doctorate in commercial science in 1951 and was promoted to associate professor. He became a full professor with tenure in 1956.Beyond his unique skills in the classroom  Williams was the author or co-author of hundreds of cases as well as numerous articles and several books  including “Basic Business Finance ” one of the seminal textbooks in the field.While Williams especially enjoyed working with M.B.A. students  he was also involved in Harvard Business School’s executive education programs. He was a member of the initial faculty group for the School’s International Senior Management Program (now part of the Advanced Management Program) in Switzerland and also taught in locally sponsored programs in places such as Italy  Japan  Venezuela  the Philippines  Holland  Mexico  and England. Under the sponsorship of the American Bankers Association  he led conferences and seminars for top officers of the nation’s largest banks and taught in the Senior Bank Officers Seminar for presidents of small banks — sessions held at HBS for many years and attended by approximately 2 300 executives. In the 1960s  he taught numerous HBS alumni seminars on topics such as mergers and acquisitions.Among the awards he received was an honorary degree from Washington and Lee University in 1966 and the Distinguished Service Award from Harvard Business School in 1990.In addition to his wife  Betty (Elizabeth Huffman)  Williams is survived by their children  Andrea of Cambridge  Mass.  and Holland of Boise  Idaho; and three grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  donations can be made in Williams’ memory to the Pine Street Inn  c/o Development Office  444 Harrison Ave.  Boston  MA 02118; First Parish Church of Weston  Mass.  c/o Betsy Gibson  349 Boston Post Road  Weston  MA 02493; or a charity of choice.A memorial service will be held at the First Parish Church of Weston on Dec. 3 at 10:30 a.m.Read the fullobituary.
Nobel laureate Norman Ramsey  96,Norman Ramsey  Harvard physics professor since 1947 and Nobel laureate in 1989  died peacefully in his sleep at age 96 on Nov. 4. Ramsey was widely admired for his scientific accomplishments and for his skill as a scientific statesman.Ramsey was honored with the Davisson-Germer Prize  the Rabi Prize  IEEE Medal of Honor  the Compton Medal  the Oersted Medal  and the U.S. National Medal of Science  among many others. He also received honorary doctorates from several universities  including Oxford and Harvard.Ramsey and his Harvard colleagueEdward Purcell(Nobel laureate 1952) wondered if positive and negative charges might cancel while remaining slightly separated within an uncharged neutron. Ramsey started the search for such an “electric dipole moment” and many theoretical predictions were disproved as more precise measurements failed to discover the elusive moment. Decades later  research teams (including those ofJohn DoyleandGerald Gabrielseat Harvard) pursued Ramsey’s quest with even higher precision — using neutrons  electrons  and nuclei. Ever the encourager  Ramsey last year offered a financial prize for detecting an electric dipole moment during his lifetime.The hydrogen maser was invented by Ramsey and his former Ph.D. student Dan Kleppner (now emeritus professor of physics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology). The hydrogen atoms in this microwave version of a laser generate microwaves with a precisely defined frequency of 1 420 405 751.77 oscillations per second. Others refined this maser into a stable and robust atomic clock that does not gain or lose a second in many millions of years. The hydrogen maser keeps time precisely enough to track satellites in deep space  to test Einstein’s general relativity  to enable very long base line interferometry (VLBI) telescopes  and to make possible a global positioning system (GPS) that locates cars and container ships within a few feet  and changes in earthquake fault lines to better than an inch.Ramsey’s “method of separated oscillatory fields” made it possible to measure molecular frequencies precisely enough to investigate small magnetic interactions  going beyond the magnetic resonance methods of his Ph.D. adviser I.I. Rabi(Nobel laureate 1944).At roughly the same time  Ramsey worked out the theory of chemical shifts of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  an essential tool of modern chemistry and structural biology. The “Ramsey method” has since been applied to many different molecules  atoms  nuclei  and particles — not the least being cesium atoms in the fountain clocks that define the internationally agreed length of a second.Ramsey’s service as a scientific statesman included being the first head of the physics department of Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. As the first assistant secretary-general for science in NATO  he established NATO fellowships and summer schools that played the role of graduate schools for a generation of European physicists. His scientific credentials and reputation for fairness played a key role in founding theFermi National Accelerator Labnear Chicago  and for many years he was chair of the University Research Association responsible for its oversight. He was president of the American Physical Society and led the NRC committee  which with Harvard colleaguePaul Horowitzconcluded that acoustical evidence did not reveal a second assassin of John F. Kennedy.During World War II  before his nearly four decades at Harvard  Ramsey led a team working on radar devices small enough to be portable  served as radar consultant to the secretary of war  and joined the Manhattan Project. Ramsey would not readily talk about the wartime part of his life. Deeply concerned about the use and long-term effect of nuclear weapons  he cautioned that it was difficult to understand the pressures of a world war in hindsight. After the war  when Sen. Joseph McCarthy labeled Harvard as “a smelly mess” and “a sanctuary for communists ” Ramsey appeared on “Meet the Press” to rebut the attacks. “True freedom ” he insisted  “gives a man not only the right to make a right choice but also the freedom to make a wrong choice.”His colleagues celebrate Ramsey for his scientific research achievements  his effective mentoring  and his contributions as a statesman of science. He inspired many with his contagious enthusiasm  his scientific integrity  his optimistic spirit  and his zest for life.Ramsey is survived by the four daughters he raised with his wife  Elinor  who died in 1983.After his retirement from the teaching faculty in 1986  Ramsey lectured in several countries  sharing his love of travel and adventure with his second wife  Ellie Welch.To read more about Ramsey’s remarkable life  visit theNobel Prize website.

Lee Davenport  radar physicist  95,Lee L. Davenport  a pioneering radar physicist who has been credited for helping to bring an end to World War II  died on Sept. 30  of cancer in Greenwich  Conn.Davenport was born Dec. 31  1915  in Schenectady  N.Y. He received a B.S. from Union College in 1937  an M.S. in 1940  and a Ph.D. in physics in 1946  both from the University of Pittsburgh.From 1940 to the end of World War II  Davenport was a research fellow at the MIT Radiation Laboratory  developing the revolutionary anti-aircraft system — known as microwave radar  or Signal Corp Radio #584 — that helped save England from the V1 buzz bombs.After the war Davenport received his doctorate for his design to remote control a missile over a radar beam. It was effectively the first guided missile  and mother of today’s drones.From 1946 to 1950 Davenport served as research fellow at Harvard and coordinated the building of the University’s92-inch cyclotron  which was then the second-largest atom smasher in the world. Davenport also taught physics at Radcliffe College during his time at Harvard.Davenport later worked in private industry  becoming the chief scientist at GTE Laboratories before retiring in 1980.He is survived by his wife  Doris Moss; daughter Carol Davenport; stepsons  Craig and Clark Moss; three grandchildren; and five step-grandchildren.A memorial service to celebrate the life of Lee Davenport will be held Oct. 22 at 2 p.m. at the First Congregational Church  108 Sound Beach Ave.  Old Greenwich  Conn.
Oscar Handlin  historian  95,Oscar Handlin  Carl M. Loeb University ProfessorEmeritus  died from a heart attack on Sept. 20 at his Cambridge home. He was 95.Handlin taught at Harvard for nearly 50 years  and was director of theHarvard University Libraryfrom 1979 to 1984. According to Robert Darnton  Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and University librarian  Handlin’s legacy at Harvard’s libraries is extensive: Handlin oversaw the construction of Pusey Library  the adoption of the Library of Congress cataloging system  and the preparation of what is now theHOLLIScatalogue.The author of more than 30 books  Handlin was a noted historian  and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1952 for “The Uprooted: The Epic Story of the Great Migrations That Made the American People.”“As a historian  he spoke to an enormous public and explained the central importance of immigration as a theme in American history ” said Darnton. “I took his course in American social history when I was a student. His lectures ended precisely at noon. He had a flat  undramatic style of lecturing  but we walked out of the lecture hall excitedly debating the points he raised.  We continued to debate them throughout lunch — in fact  in some cases  for the rest of our lives.”Handlin leaves behind a wife  Lilian (Bombach) Handlin  a brother  Nathan  and children David  Joanna Handlin Smith  and Ruth Handlin Manley. He also leaves four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.A memorial service will be held at a future date.

Baruj Benacerraf  Nobel laureate  90,Baruj Benacerraf  who earned a 1980 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his groundbreaking research in immunology and ledDana-Farber Cancer Institutethrough a period of tremendous growth beginning that year  died in Boston on Aug. 2 at the age of 90.Benacerraf’s medical legacy is broad. As a physician-scientist  he discovered that genetic factors play a central role in the function of the immune system  a finding that paved the way for most of modern immunology and earned the Nobel Prize for him and colleagues Jean Dausset of the Université de Paris  and George D. Snell of Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor  Maine.As president of Dana-Farber  Benacerraf helped the institution expand both physically and scientifically. He recruited top researchers and clinicians from around the world to Dana-Farber’s Boston campus  where they could also serve as teaching professors at Harvard Medical School next door. He himself was chairman of the Department of Pathology and was the George Fabyan Professor of Comparative Pathology atHarvard Medical Schoolfrom 1970 to 1991.As Dana-Farber’s international reputation grew  so did its physical footprint  with completion of the Louis B. Mayer Laboratories in 1988 and the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Research Laboratories building nearly a decade later. Benacerraf led Dana-Farber through that expansion  tapping into his keen understanding of business  which he developed from his father  a successful financier and textile importer.Stepping down as president in 1992  he continued working daily in his own lab at Dana-Farber into his 80s  and hosted an annual symposium at which he delighted in chatting with the many former students and protégés who had become international leaders in the fight against cancer and related diseases.“Dr. Benacerraf’s seminal discoveries about genetic control of the immune system made possible much of what we now know about basic disease processes such as infection  autoimmune disorders  and cancer ” said Dana-Farber President Edward J. Benz Jr. “His work has shaped everything from organ transplantation  to AIDS treatment  to  most recently  the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines.”Benacerraf had an upbringing that helped shape him as a leader. Born in Caracas  Venezuela  in 1920  and raised in pre-World War II Paris  he came to the United States in 1939. He was educated first at Columbia University  and then at the Medical College of Virginia. After serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps  he began a career in medical research. In his 1998 autobiography  “From Caracas to Stockholm: A Life In Medical Science ” he discussed the anti-Semitic quota systems and anti-foreigner bias he encountered in being rejected by 25 medical schools  including Harvard.In 1956 he went to New York University School of Medicine to work in cellular immunology  where his students included future Dana-Farber colleagues Steven Burakoff and Stuart Schlossman. Schlossman said it was Benacerraf’s ability to identify good people and bring them together that made him so successful as a leader.“He was extremely considerate of people  and had sensitivity for their needs ” said Schlossman  the Baruj Benacerraf Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “He created an environment where everybody could prosper  and young people could develop wonderful careers of their own. The scientific health of our community was supported tremendously by Dr. Benacerraf.”His late wife  Annette Dreyfus  who died on June 3  was the niece of another Nobel laureate (Jacques Lucien Monod) and was almost always by Benacerraf’s side at symposia and other events in recent years. Their only child  Beryl Benacerraf  is a radiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital  a clinical professor of radiology and obstetrics  gynecology  and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School  and the president and founder at Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates.In addition to his daughter  he is survived by his brother Paul Benacerraf  who is the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Philosophyemeritusat Princeton University and former provost at Princeton (1988-91)  and two grandchildren  Brigitte Libby of Chestnut Hill  and Oliver Libby of New York City.“Baruj Benacerraf was a congenital leader ” said Dana-Farber PresidentEmeritusDavid G. Nathan. “He combined scientific insight  brilliant management skills  no-nonsense tolerance  fierce loyalty  and remarkable vision. Dana-Farber achieved widely accepted prominence under his guidance. We are deeply grateful to his memory and to his late wife  daughter  and grandchildren  who shared so much of him with us.”
Gordon Kaufman  leading theologian  dies,Gordon Dester Kaufman  Edward Mallinckrodt  Jr. Professor of DivinityEmeritusatHarvard Divinity School  died on Friday  July 22  at age 86.A member of the Faculty of Divinity since 1963  Kaufman was a renowned liberal theologian whose research  writing  and teachings had a profound influence on constructive and systematic theology. He argued for a vision of God as the “profound mystery of creativity ” the “ongoing creativity in the universe.” By rethinking theology in naturalistic terms  he made significant contribution to discussions of religion and science  ecological issues  and evolution. His rethinking of the meaning of Jesus for today and his reimagination of central symbols of Christian tradition were significant for his engagement with religious pluralism and promotion of interfaith understanding.“At the core of Gordon’s theological imagination of God as mystery and creativity was his deep commitment to nonviolence  justice  and human flourishing ” said Karen King  Hollis Professor of Divinity at HDS. “He was a deeply ethical  profoundly compassionate person  so that the lively intellectual conversations I and others so enjoyed with him were always grounded by his fundamental sense of joy and duty in connection to all living things. He was a great gift to his colleagues and students  and to the field of theology.”Kaufman was born on June 22  1925  in Newton  Kansas. He earned a bachelor of arts from Bethel College in Kansas in 1947. He went on to earn an MA in sociology from Northwestern University in 1948  a BD from Yale Divinity School in 1951  and a PhD in philosophical theology from Yale University in 1955  with a dissertation titled “The Problem of Relativism and the Possibility of Metaphysics.” He was later awarded an honorary MA from Harvard in 1963  an LHD from Bethel College in 1973  and an LHD from Carleton College in 2007. Kaufman was ordained in 1953 in the General Conference Mennonite Church. He also served on the Bethel College Board of Directors from 1964 to 1976.Kaufman served terms as president of the New England Region of the American Academy of Religion (1979–80)  and later of the entire AAR (1981–82). He served a term as president of the American Theological Society (1979–80). He was also a member of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies  and an active and longtime member of the Boston Theological Society.Read Full Story
John Lemuel Bethune,John Lemuel “Lem” Bethune was born in Baddeck  Nova Scotia  in 1926 and died on June 14  2008  at the age of 82 in Barnstable  Mass. He received a B.Sc. in chemistry from Acadia University in Nova Scotia in 1947 and took a position as a professional chemist with Canadian Breweries Research Institute.  There  together with F.L. Rigby  he worked on the development of a reliable method to analyze the components in beer that contribute to its bitterness. Brewers had been trying since the late 1800s to classify and quantify the bitter constituents of hops but without success. None of the sophisticated separation techniques now so readily available had been invented at that time and Lem and his co-workers turned to the tedious method of countercurrent distribution  which involves repetitive partitioning of solutes between two immiscible solvents (and was the forerunner of modern HPLC). In the early 1950s they published a series of papers describing the isolation of the principal bitterness components of hops  and in conjunction with absorption spectrophotometry  they established a method for bitterness analysis as well as defining a bitterness standard  subsequently called the Rigby-Bethune unit.Lem’s interest in separations technology eventually prompted him to enter graduate school at Clark University in Worcester  MA where he joined the laboratory of Gerson Kegeles  a leader in the countercurrent distribution field.  There he focused on the theoretical aspects of moving boundary experiments involving first a single species undergoing countercurrent distribution and later chemically reacting systems.  The Kegeles laboratory also specialized in ultracentrifugation and Lem developed techniques to take advantage of the enormous pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) generated in an ultracentrifuge cell and to study the effects of pressure on equilibrium constants of chemically reacting systems.In the late 1950’s computers were not only uncommon but rather massive pieces of equipment. Lem’s studies generated large amounts of data  required extensive calculations and clearly called for major computational assistance that unfortunately was not available to him in Worcester. Somehow  while in Worcester  Lem made contact with the computer center at MIT and for several years he made innumerable trips back and forth to Cambridge to feed punched cards into an MIT reader and collect reams of numbers.Lem received his Ph.D. in 1961 and moved to Boston and Harvard Medical School to join the Biophysics Research Laboratory under the direction of Bert Vallee and located in the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Not only did the lab have an ultracentrifuge  it also had a moving boundary electrophoresis apparatus that came to occupy much of Lem’s time.  In addition  the lab had a large group of research fellows with whom Lem could collaborate and who benefited greatly from Lem’s broad range of knowledge and expertise. He had gone from being an analytical organic chemist to a theoretical one and now found himself immersed in enzymology. He fortuitously discovered that one of the enzymes of interest in the laboratory  carboxypeptidase A  underwent polymerization in high salt solutions or in the presence of aromatic compounds  and it therefore provided him with an ideal system to examine using ultracentrifuge methods he had developed at Clark.  As a consequence  several novel publications emerged from this work.Lem’s contributions during his early years in the Biophysics Research Laboratory revealed his exceptional talents. He continued his interest in sedimentation analysis  became expert in enzyme kinetics  explored subunit dissociation of proteins  examined the role of zinc in alcohol dehydrogenase and devised models for enzyme mechanisms. In addition  he served as financial officer for the laboratory and assumed many other operational responsibilities. During this time he was appointed Assistant Professor (1966–1969) and then Associate Professor (1969–1975) of Biological Chemistry.By the beginning of the 1970’s ultracentrifugation  long the gold standard for determining molecular weights of macromolecules  was being superseded by more convenient techniques such as gel chromatography and SDS-gel electrophoresis.  Nevertheless  Lem made one more improvement in the sedimentation approach  i.e. the use of time-lapse photography that could be adapted to the ultracentrifuge and facilitate determination of molecular weights.  He developed this approach after attending a meeting of the International Union of Biochemistry in 1967 in Tokyo.  While there he decided to acquire a movie camera.  This sparked an interest in photography that was to become a life-long hobby as well as a critical tool for his research.In 1972 the Vallee laboratory joined forces with that of Judah Folkman at Children’s Hospital to search for the angiogenic factor that Folkman had proposed was secreted by solid tumors. Working with support from a one-year contract provided by the National Cancer Institute  Lem helped the Vallee team with his separation science expertise now applied to cell culture media.  The factor proved extremely elusive and after a year the NIH contract was not renewed.  But then the Monsanto Co.  looking for a way to get into large-scale cell culture and gain a “window on biology”  decided that this project was just what they needed and thus was born the Harvard-Monsanto Project  a multi-million dollar pioneering venture between industry and academe.  Scaling up from Petri dishes to multiliter culture vats along with learning how to ship samples from St. Louis to Boston  eventually led to the isolation of angiogenin  which turned out to be a member of the pancreatic ribonuclease family of proteins.  Lem co-authored all the initial publications associated with this project.  Of particular importance was his mathematical skill  mainly in applying statistics to evaluate data from large numbers of animal experiments.In 1975  there was a movement to create an appointment in chemistry in the Department of Radiology. Lem’s thorough training in physical chemistry  and his interest in diffusion  macromolecular interactions  and the transport of molecules in a variety of systems were considered uniquely suited for this new position.  He served as Professor of Radiology (Biochemistry) from 1975 to 1993.  He continued to conduct basic research in macromolecular structure and function as well as in angiogenesis.  He also spent long hours formulating equations relating to boundary analysis  a kind of universal field theory of separation science.  In 1980 be was appointed Treasurer of the Endowment for Research in Human Biology  an entity created with support from the Bronfman Foundation to study alcohol metabolism in humans.  He served in that capacity until 1985.  The latter part of his career was spent teaching statistics to the radiology interns and residents  and as a consultant in statistics for members of the Center for Biochemical and Biophysical Sciences and Medicine.  He retired in 1993 as Professor of Radiology (Biochemistry) Emeritus.Lem lived in Medfield for many years and had great satisfaction working in his garden and maintaining his property.  He enjoyed traveling  especially if it involved something like hiking in Italy or piloting a barge through the canals of Ireland.  He moved to Barnstable on Cape Cod several years ago where he became a member of the Barnstable Land Trust  Inc. and a supporter of the Visiting Nurse Association and the Falmouth Hospital.He is survived by his wife  Nancy L.  by his brother Norman  by his sister-in-law Marie Bethune  and by many nieces and nephews.  He was buried in Barnstable.Respectfully submitted James F.

Reinhold Brinkmann,Reinhold Brinkmann  a distinguished scholar whose writings on music of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries made an indelible mark on musicology in Germany and the United States  taught in the Department of Music at Harvard University from 1985 until his retirement in 2003  serving  after 1990  as James Edward Ditson Professor of Music and  from 1991-1994  as department Chair.His commitment to teaching and high standards for performance from students was clear in the way he ran his Core course  “The Symphonic Century.”  He told students that he assumed they could read music and had considerable experience with the repertory already.  But just in case there were students who felt that a little brushing up might help  he came an hour early to every class to give a sort of shadow course to anyone wise enough to realize what a gift they were being given.  In his Core course on fin-de-siècle Vienna  Reinhold  who did not like the word “interdisciplinary ” spoke with passion and immense erudition about the paintings of Kokoschka and Klimt  the plays of Hofmannsthal  the novels of Joseph Roth  and the architecture of Adolf Loos.  Most amazing of all  he inspired legions of undergraduates to delve into  appreciate  and  in some cases  even to love the atonal music of Schoenberg  Berg  and Webern.Reinhold was in his time at Harvard not only a remarkably warm and caring colleague  but a very effective Chair  in part thanks to his strong relationships with colleagues in composition  theory  and music history.  He was that rare figure of a music historian who was passionately curious about the newest music.  He worked closely with all his Harvard composer colleagues  and also enjoyed close friendships with composers Helmut Lachenmann  Wolfgang Rihm  and Luciano Berio  who dedicated his Sonata per pianoforte solo to him in 2001.Reinhold came to Harvard from West Berlin  where he had been a Professor at the Hochschule der Künste since 1980  and  prior to that  Professor of Musicology at the University of Marburg.  From 1976-1980  he directed the Institut für Neue Musik und Musikerziehung in Darmstadt.  He received his doctorate from the Universität Freiburg (with H. H. Eggebrecht) in 1967  and his Habilitation from the Freie Universität  Berlin (with Rudolf Stephan) in 1970.Born in 1934  in Wildeshausen  Germany  at a time when his country was ruled by an infamous regime that did not  fortunately  last one thousand years  but only twelve  Reinhold often spoke of one of his earliest memories: when he was four years old  experiencing the tumult and the smell of burning buildings on Kristallnacht  he could not understand why the firemen did not come.  These childhood traumas not only shaped Reinhold’s later left-wing political consciousness  but also underlay his acute awareness of the links between music  culture  and society.  At his death  he was working on a book called “The Distorted Sublime” about how the Nazi regime appropriated and misused the German classical musical tradition.His writings span a broad range of topics  including the Second Viennese School (especially Schoenberg)  the Romantic Lied tradition  Wagner  Skryabin  Varèse  Eisler  and Ives.  Brinkmann’s work combines intimate knowledge of the music  often shown in detailed  painstaking analyses  with an awareness of its social and political backgrounds and ramifications.  His publications include his nuanced and thought-provoking study of Brahms’s Second Symphony  Late Idyll (Harvard University Press  1995) and a volume on German musicians who fled Fascism  co-edited with Christoph Wolff  “Driven Into Paradise”: The Musical Migration from Nazi Germany to the United States (1999).  His edition of Schoenberg’s Pierrot lunaire for the Schoenberg Gesamtausgabe  in particular his book-length critical report on the work’s sources and its historical and biographical position  was a groundbreaking contribution to the Schoenberg literature.  His choice of Arnold Schoenberg’s atonal music as a dissertation topic was highly unusual in Germany in the 1960s.  In his path-breaking study of Schoenberg’s Three Pieces for Piano  Op. 11  Brinkmann developed his own analytical method  rigorous yet contextual  which yielded major insights into Schoenberg’s aesthetic and historical position.  A lifelong interest in German Lieder and poetry was reflected in his monograph  Schumann und Eichendorff: Studien zum Liederkreis Op. 39 (1997) and in his substantial contribution on the nineteenth century Lied tradition in the volume Musikalische Lyrik (2004).  Reinhold was always fascinated with the frieze of famous composers’ names in Paine Hall  and his last publication  Harvard’s Paine Hall: Musical Canon and the New England Barn (2010)  was a playful and learned essay on the origins of the building and its visible display of the musical canon  anno 1914.In 2001  Reinhold was the first musicologist to be awarded the prestigious Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.  His acceptance speech was a visionary declaration of what musicology could be.  This “new musicology” imagined  first  the fundamental equality of all musical traditions as objects of study.  He also envisioned new ways of communicating about music that could include the general public: “I see musicologists learning from poets  speaking and writing in an understandable but richly nuanced language.”  His own work  with its lucid prose  forceful thinking  and deep humanity  exemplifies this vision.  In 2006 he was elected an Honorary Member of the American Musicological Society  a major honor and a singular one for a scholar neither born nor trained in the United States. Conversations always branched out from music to art  literature  architecture  sports  and history  and he always had time to talk.  Reinhold had an absolutely penetrating gaze when he was looking for a certain answer—it sometimes terrified graduate students until they saw where he was going  said the right thing  and were rewarded with his thundering “yes!”  His colleagues sometimes felt the same terror and joy.He possessed a sartorial elegance that we may not see in our department again.  Most inspiring to his students was his conviction that musicology was not simply an academic discipline  but rather a deeply ethical undertaking that could have a real impact on the way we hear music and see the world.  Musicology has lost a scholar of great insight and integrity  and we will miss him.Reinhold Brinkmann died  after a long illness  in Eckernförde  Germany  at the age of 76.

He was 91.A member of the Harvard faculty since 1952  Tagiuri became a professor at HBS in 1957  where he spent the next three decades teaching in the School’s executive education programs  first in the advanced management program for senior executives and then in the owner/president management program for entrepreneurs and leaders of family-owned organizations. An influential scholar and superb teacher  he left the active faculty in 1986  but continued to write  lecture  and consult long after his retirement.“Ron Tagiuri was blessed with a great mind that he used relentlessly to explain complicated  indeed messy  problems involving people  relationships  and organizations ” said senior lecturer John Davis  faculty chair of the School’s families in business program and a longtime colleague of Tagiuri. “He provided orderly  constructive approaches to managing these challenges. His ability to do this so fluidly has much to do with the fact that he deeply understood human psychology and tackled problems like the exacting engineer he was.”A memorial service is planned for later in the spring.To read the full obituary.
Muhsin Mahdi,Professor Muhsin S. Mahdi  James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic Emeritus  at Harvard University  died on July 9  2007  in Brookline  Massachusetts  after a long series of illnesses  at the age of 81. Universally acclaimed as the leading specialist in medieval Arabic and Islamic philosophy  Mahdi was born in 1926 in the city of Karbala  Iraq  where his mother gave birth to him leaning against the wall of the sanctuary of Imam al-Husayn. After schooling in Karbala and Najaf  he finished high school in Baghdad. An outstanding student  he was awarded a government scholarship to study business administration at the American University of Beirut  where he earned both a B.B.A. and a B.A. in philosophy (1947). He taught for a year at the University of Baghdad (1947-1948) before coming to the United States on another Iraqi government scholarship to begin graduate studies in economics at the University of Chicago. Here he was soon able to pursue his true vocation: he studied with Nabia Abbott at the Oriental Institute and began his profound exploration of political philosophy under the guidance of Leo Strauss (1948-1954). His dissertation  on Ibn Khaldūn  was immediately recognized as groundbreaking.After a year as a post-doctoral fellow in Paris and two more years of teaching at the University of Baghdad  he returned to the University of Chicago  where he taught in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from 1957-1969. At Harvard University from 1969 until his retirement in 1996  he was the James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic and served as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and later also as chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. Mahdi conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Freiburg  Germany. He was a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow and a Fulbright research scholar in Morocco. He held visiting professorships at the University of Freiburg  the American University in Cairo  the Central Institute of Islamic Research in Pakistan  the University of California  Los Angeles  and the University of Bordeaux. He was a founding member and president of the International Society for the History of Arabic Sciences and Philosophy and a founding member and board member of the Middle East Studies Association. He served on the editorial boards of four important journals in the field: Arabic Sciences and Philosophy: A Historical Journal; the Journal of Near Eastern Studies; Hamdard Islamicus; and Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy. He also served as president of the American Research Center in Egypt and was honored by being the first corresponding member of the Cairo Academy of Arabic Language.Upon retirement  he divided his time between Cambridge  Massachusetts  the French countryside  and Paris  where he lectured at the Institut du Monde Arabe and frequented the cafés and bookshops that were the meeting places of artists and intellectuals from all over the Muslim world  many of them former students. Shortly before his death  he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the American University in Cairo—sadly  in absentia. Professor Mahdi had an incomparable command of the medieval Arabic language in its many varieties (depending on subject matter  geographical and/or religious context  and author’s training). Having steeped himself in the well-proven methods of critical editions of manuscripts developed in Western scholarship  he ardently desired to establish the same rigorous standards in the field of Arabic and Islamic philosophy. He devoted much of his career to searching for manuscripts wherever his travels took him. A rigorous but stimulating teacher  he emphasized fine-tuned analysis and interpretation of the Arabic philosophical texts. He was an enormously influential teacher  and one who inspired great loyalty from his students. A sense of Mahdi’s teaching can be gauged by the impressive 1992 festschrift  The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy  edited by one of his closest students  Charles Butterworth. He is especially known for the recovery  edition  translation  and analysis of the writings of the philosopher Abū Nasr al-Fārābī (870-950 CE). His last book  Alfarabi and the Foundation of Islamic Political Philosophy (2001)  is a collection of luminous and illuminating essays. With Ralph Lerner of Chicago and the late Ernest Fortin of Boston College  he co-edited Medieval Political Philosophy  a sourcebook that includes selections in translation from Hebrew  Latin  and Arabic. However  there is a second pillar of Muhsin Mahdi’s fame: his critical edition of the earliest extant manuscript of The Thousand and One Nights—a core of tales that would be transformed and expanded  beginning with Galland and going on to Lane and Burton and beyond  into the quintessential Orientalist creation of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Alf Layla wa Layla  Leiden  1984; third volume  in English  1994). The edition was the outcome of a Herculean labor  since the manuscripts of the Thousand and One Nights are numerous  though mostly not very old  and the text  being on the border of oral and written literature  is in constant flux  which meant that Mahdi had to develop a special method to achieve what would deserve to be called a critical text.As Steve Lenzner has written  “In his life and work  Muhsin Mahdi transcended the idea of East and West. He was  as a friend put it after his death  a liberal in the old-fashioned and elevated sense  deeply versed in  and shaped by  the world’s great books. In no way did this show itself more clearly than in Mahdi’s devotion to his teacher Leo Strauss. Mahdi’s last book  Alfarabi and the Foundation of Islamic Political Philosophy (2001)—the fruit of a lifetime of study and unsurpassed on the subject—bears the dedication: ‘For L.S.—If we had to repay the debt of gratitude incurred by his kindness to us  not even the whole of time would suffice.’” Some colleagues considered the Nights a diversion from his work in philosophy  but those with deeper understanding have always known that creative literature often serves as a refuge for political philosophy in troubled times.  Charismatic and charming  with a mischievous smile and a cordial laugh  Muhsin Mahdi was also an intensely private person who maintained the stance of a true philosopher throughout decades marked by conflict between and among peoples of the three religions of the Book. It is evident  however  that the destruction of his native land by his adopted country was finally too much for him. His health  already seriously affected by the Gulf War in 1992  was dealt another blow in September 2001. March 2003 was a fatal wound  although it took him four more years of mental and physical anguish and suffering to die from it.Professor Mahdi is survived by his wife  Sarah Roche-Mahdi; two daughters  Fatima and Nadia  from a previous marriage to Cynthia Risner; and two stepdaughters  Rachel and Rebekah Gerstein. He is also survived by his first wife  Louise Carus Mahdi.  His granddaughter Lina Morouj Colla  daughter of Nadia and her husband  Elliott Colla  was born October 31  2007.Respectfully submitted William A.

William Lipscomb dies at 91,William Nunn Lipscomb Jr. emeritusprofessor and winner of theNobel Prize in chemistry in 1976  died at age 91 in Cambridge  Mass.  on Thursday (April 14) of pneumonia and other complications resulting after a fall.Lipscomb was professor of chemistry at Harvard from 1959 to 1971  Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry from 1971 to 1990  and Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of ChemistryEmeritus  since his retirement in 1990.According to The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  his studies of boranes and related chemical compounds “enormously enriched” the field and provided scientists with “a deeper insight into the nature of chemical bonding.”Years later  during his retirement  Lipscomb participated in the gentle mockery of this accomplishment by joining other Nobel laureates as participants in the Ig Nobel Prize ceremonies  held in Harvard’s Sanders Theatre.Lipscomb was born in Cleveland and grew up in Lexington  Ky. He earned a bachelor of science in chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941 and a Ph.D. in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in 1946. Before arriving at Harvard  he taught at the University of Minnesota from 1946 to 1959. He is survived by his wife  Jean. He also is survived by three children  including two from an earlier marriage  as well as three grandchildren  and four great-grandchildren.
A moving tribute,Hundreds of people crowded Harvard’sMemorial Churchon Wednesday (April 6) to honor the life and legacy of the Rev. Peter J. Gomes  who died in February at age 68.Gomes  the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in theMemorial ChurchatHarvard University  served there for 41 years. The nearly two-hour memorial service was filled with music  including “When the Perfect Comes ” an anthem that Gomes commissioned to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his ordination. The service included many fond remembrances from longtime friends and colleagues for the man at the heart of Harvard’s spiritual life for so long.“It is heartening to look out and see so many people here  remembering a man who meant so much to us all ” said Harvard PresidentDrew Faust. “There was music in Peter ” she added  “a symphony of points and counterpoints. He rewarded close listening from a careful ear.”Former Harvard President Derek Bok  who helped to hire Gomes  said the minister arrived during the turbulent early 1970s  when many students were “at odds with the University  the society  the government.”But through his work  Gomes tried to build “a community of Harvard’s vast collection of busy people  all intent on their particular interests and ambitions.”Gomes became “a unifying figure ” said Bok  “whose love of the University helped us all to appreciate our being here even more.”Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr. escorts Cynthia Wight Rossano out of the church following the memorial service honoring the life and legacy of Rev. Peter J. Gomes. Photo by Justin Ide/Harvard Staff PhotographerThe pews were jammed with dignitaries  colleagues  and friends from the Harvard community  as well as members of the church’s congregation  admirers  acquaintances  and former students.The Rev. Mike Mullany of the First Congregational Church in Adams  Mass.  made the two-and-a-half hour trip with his son Ben for the memorial. Mullany  who took a preaching class with Gomes in 2000  recalled his influential teaching about the power and importance of scripture.“He used to talk about each passage being a diamond. You could hold it up and look at any facet and find something of value and truth … from whatever angle you came at it.”Though Gomes  who died Feb. 28  had held many titles and honorary degrees  was a formidable scholar  and authored many books  article  and papers  he was best known for his oratorical skills. He was widely considered one of the nation’s most distinguished preachers. His style and substance  whether at the pulpit or a party  carried a profound impact.“We listened to the music of his voice  his beautiful choice of words ” said Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick  who met Gomes as a Harvard undergraduate during one of Gomes’ weekly teas. “We listened and we learned about life  faith  love and loss ” Patrick said  “but mostly about how to be better people.”Gomes  renowned for his humor and wit  would have appreciated the service’s many lighter moments.Faust drew roars from the crowd when she recalled his arrival to welcome her as Harvard’s first female president.“He came to my office  which was then still at Radcliffe  dressed in his regalia. It was for him a very serious occasion. He sat down and looked at me  and in that unforgettable voice of his  he said  ‘Madam  I come to pledge my fealty.’ What do you say back to that?”“He loved antiques  long  multicourse dinner parties with sparkling conversation  and rich old ladies ” said Patrick to waves of laughter.Patrick said Gomes  who was gay  conservative  and African-American  lived with courage  without labels  and “stubbornly on his own terms. By refusing to be put in anyone else’s box  Peter Gomes may have been the freest man I have ever known.”Patrick also recalled how Gomes first cautioned him against running for governor  fearful that the experience would break his spirit. Gomes  a Republican  then promptly changed his party affiliation so he could vote for Patrick in the primary.The service closed with the choral benediction by Johannes Brahms. “Create in me a clean heart  O God ” members of the Harvard University Choir past and present sang  “and renew a right spirit within me.” Photo by Justin Ide/Harvard Staff PhotographerThe service closed with the choral benediction by Johannes Brahms. “Create in me a clean heart  O God ” members of theHarvard University Choirpast and present sang  “and renew a right spirit within me.”Ellen Adolph  a retired administrative assistant atHarvard Law School(HLS) who used to work with Gomes in coordinating memorial services for HLS faculty  attended the service to pay her respects  and to “think back again on what he was like and what he thought  to be reminded of him.”“He was someone to look up to  and to model oneself after. … He had such a humanity.”Rev.

Stuart T. Hauser,Stuart T. Hauser  M.D.  Ph.D.  an internationally acclaimed expert in adolescent development  died at age 70 on August 5  2008  of complications following surgery for esophageal cancer. He was Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School  Senior Scientist at Judge Baker Children’s Center  and Co-Director of the Clinical Research Training Program in Social and Biological Psychiatry. He leaves his wife Barbara (Blank) Hauser  sons Joshua and Ethan  and two grandchildren. Among his important Harvard-wide activities  he was a co-founder of the Clinical Research training program (now re-named the Stuart T. Hauser CRTP) and the Harvard Psychiatry Department Research Committee and was also the first Co-Chair of the Harvard Psychiatry Executive Committee. He was President of the Judge Baker Children’s Center from 1993-2004 and presided over its transition to the present enlarged facility. In research  he was known for his work in adolescent development and his focus on resilience to adversity. He also served as President of the Society for Research on Adolescence. Most recently  he became Professor at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo  consulting with researchers on studies of high-risk adolescents. He was the author and co-author of more than 100 articles  37 chapters and 8 books. He was a member of more than 10 editorial boards  including the Harvard Review of Psychiatry.Stuart grew up as an only child under very modest circumstances in the Bronx  where his father had a small store. He excelled at Bronx High School of Science and at Antioch College  where he majored in both philosophy and physics. After two years as a graduate student at Harvard in Social Relations  he went on to Yale Medical School    where his combined interest in science and humanities led to a research thesis on Black and White identity formation in lower socioeconomic class adolescent boys that became his first book. For Stuart  psychiatry offered possibilities to efforts to integrate his life-long interests in science and humanities. After completing his psychiatric residency at Massachusetts Mental Health Center  he spent two years in Lyman Wynn’s family research laboratory at the NIMH  followed by a decision to seek a PhD in Psychology at Harvard while simultaneously pursuing psychoanalytic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. In graduate school he met Barbara Blank Hauser  and their shared devotion to clinical work and passion for intellectual rigor and excellence laid the foundation for their lifelong bond and 44 years of marriage.Stuart possessed an unusual ability to resonate with the feelings of others  so that students and colleagues who worked with him felt a warm and special relationship. Indeed  Stuart valued friendship enormously and went to great lengths to sustain his relationships through shared meals  letters  and phone calls. Outside of his busy professional life  Stuart found joy in mastering activities to which he had had minimal youthful exposure such as tennis  hiking  skiing  sailing  and learning to play the piano. His most relaxing times included weekend trips and family vacations in his idyllic lakeside home in Maine. On its deck  with the White Mountains in view  he engaged in wide-ranging conversations with friends and his two beloved sons  Joshua  a physician and Ethan  a writer.His academic career was strongly influenced by the developmental theories of Erik Erikson. Stuart spent his career studying adolescent and adult identity and psychosocial development. In 1978 he began a landmark longitudinal study  Across Generations  tracking the lives of 146 normal and psychiatrically-hospitalized adolescents. A primary passion of Stuart’s throughout the next 30 years was understanding the construct of ego development—the growing capacity of the individual to integrate diverse sources of information (internal  social and environmental)  balancing the needs of self and other  to move forward in the world. The match between scholar and topic was fitting  as Stuart embodied all of these capacities throughout his career. Stuart was also inherently a developmentalist. He did some of the earliest theoretical work recognizing that development could proceed along different trajectories for different individuals—and he was developing ways to capture these trajectories empirically almost a decade before the modern statistics of trajectory analysis began to have an impact on the field.As much as Stuart was committed to understanding the development of the individual human organism  he also recognized at a deep level the profound ways in which family interactions shaped this development. Not content with the paper and pencil measures available at the time to assess these interactions  Stuart developed methods for observing family interactions in vivo  so that key qualities of family relationships could be better understood by researchers. Not surprisingly  a favorite adjective of his applied to human development was “complex”  and he continually sought a deeper understanding rather than simple  facile explanations.His study of development was not only groundbreaking but also enduring. With original participants now in their mid-forties  the study continues  having been federally funded for most of its duration. Not surprisingly  as the study’s participants matured  and our scientific technologies developed  Stuart’s interests developed and expanded along with them. His most recent book  Out of the Woods: Tales of Resilient Teens  (co-authored with Joseph Allen  Ph.D.)  explored mechanisms by which troubled adolescents are able to overcome social and psychological adversity to lead more stable and satisfying lives in adulthood. This early study of ego development and family relations now considers outcomes ranging from adult metabolic syndrome to the intergenerational transmission of relationship patterns to the interaction of genes and environment in determining behavior.A graduate of the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute  Stuart soon became a faculty member  active on the research committee and director of the Deutsch Prize Committee (for best scientific paper) for several years. He was known as a tough reader and challenging critic  while able to be generous with time to aspiring younger colleagues. He subsequently moved his analytic teaching to the newer Psychoanalytic Institute of New England East (PINE). Throughout his career  Stuart maintained a clinical practice  and  for over thirty years  he was a member of a peer group of analytic clinicians that met monthly. He was notorious for telephoning shortly before the meeting to be reminded of the time and place  yet inevitably appeared  sometimes looking the worse for wear while recounting his immersion in grant writing and administrative tasks  to put on his clinical hat and raise his inimitable questions about hasty formulations or assumptions. Constantly looking for linkages to research data and knowledgeable about a vast range of developmental and psychoanalytic studies  Stuart could be exasperating in his unrelenting efforts to get his colleagues up to speed and in his dismissal of those he saw as rigid purveyors of doctrine. Yet he also enjoyed a good joke and could end a heated interchange by sharing a hearty laugh with the group. He played an instrumental role in creating a psychoanalytic research society open to non-psychoanalysts. During his final weeks of life  he devoted precious hours to getting the proposal for this organization circulated and responding to comments  almost as if he knew that his time was limited.His career in Mentoring “across generations” was most clearly and memorably expressed in his work and leadership in what is now formally renamed  in his memory  the Stuart T. Hauser  M.D.  Ph.D. Harvard Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP) in Biological and Social Psychiatry. This program began when Miles Shore  M.D.  then head of the Massachusetts Mental Health Center (MMHC) and Harvard Department Chair  asked Stuart and Robert W. McCarley  M.D. to begin a formal post-doctoral training program for psychologists and psychiatrists through the NIMH T32 program  a funding mechanism providing salary and other support to help the career development of promising individuals. He and Bob McCarley had diverse research interests  although both were graduates of the MMHC residency and MMHC faculty members. Stuart was beginning his developmental work while Bob spent most of his time in animal research listening to the activity of neurons generating REM (Dream) sleep. They decided that  as true in their own careers  social/developmental and biologically based research each had much to offer post-doctoral trainees working in all areas of psychiatry field. So they wrote the application as a combined training program in these two domains. Stuart generously accepted overseeing the major administrative tasks in running the program  and assumed the formal roles of Director and Principal Investigator. According to our best information  this was and is the only combined social and biological NIMH training program. Moreover  the 32 years of continued function of the CRTP makes it the longest continually functioning and funded psychiatric research training program of its kind in the USA.Over the years under Stuart’s leadership  the CRTP expanded its research resources and training sites to include all the Harvard psychiatric hospitals and research sites. The CRTP now offers 40 potential research training sites at 14 different Harvard affiliated institutions. The success of the program in training the leaders of the next generations is evident in the number of graduates who have become professors and department chairs – a further tribute to Stuart’s generativity and tenacity in successfully obtaining funding throughout the decades. Stuart would be most pleased to see the program carry on the mission he so creatively instituted and sustained.A respected and beloved colleague  he will be greatly missed by HMS faculty  child and adult development researchers  psychoanalytic scholars  and a host of former students. In honor of his scientific legacy  the Stuart T. Hauser Memorial Fund has been established at Harvard Medical School recognizing a faculty member for outstanding mentorship of medical students  residents  fellows and junior faculty in the areas of adult and child psychiatry  human development  and psycho-social research.Respectfully submitted Robert W.

Rev. Peter J. Gomes dies at 68,The Rev. Professor Peter J. Gomes  Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in theMemorial Churchat Harvard University  died on Feb. 28 from complications arising from a stroke. He was 68 years old.Gomes  an American Baptist minister  served in the Memorial Church since 1970. He was a member of both theDivinity Schoolfaculty and theFaculty of Arts and Sciencesat Harvard. Gomes authored many books  including the best-sellers “The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart” and “Sermons: Biblical Wisdom for Daily Living ” as well as numerous articles and papers.Widely regarded as one of America’s leading preachers  Gomes participated in the inaugurations of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. He was named Clergy of the Year by the organization Religion in American Life in 1998; in 1979 Time magazine called him “one of the seven most distinguished preachers in America.” He received 39 honorary degrees and was an Honorary Fellow ofEmmanuel College  University of Cambridge.“We are deeply saddened by this loss ” said Harvard President Drew Faust. “Peter Gomes was an original. For 40 years  he has served Harvard as a teacher in the fullest sense — a scholar  a mentor  one of the great preachers of our generation  and a living symbol of courage and conviction. Through his wisdom and appreciation of the richness of the human spirit Reverend Gomes has left an indelible mark on the institution he served with unmatched devotion and creativity. He will be sorely missed.”“No one epitomizes all that is good about Harvard more than Peter J. Gomes ” said Henry Louis Gates Jr.  Harvard’s Alphonse Fletcher University Professor. The pair met in 1991 when Gomes was part of a recruiting committee that helped to bring Gates to the University. Gates quipped it was “love at first sight ” and said Gomes had been a loyal friend and adviser for 20 years.“He was one of the nation’s truly great preachers and one of Harvard’s truly great scholars ” said Gates  who directs Harvard’sW.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research. Gates also praised Gomes for his expertise on the history both of Christianity and of Harvard University and for his “keen storytelling capacity.”“Peter has been a powerful presence in the University for more than four decades ” said William Graham  dean of Harvard Divinity School  who first met Gomes at Harvard in 1966.Graham recalled hearing Gomes offer parting words to graduating College seniors during Commencement. Those speeches “are masterpieces  both humorous and moving valedictions. That was something very special for undergraduates ” said Graham  John Lord O’Brian Professor of Divinity and Murray A. Albertson Professor of Middle Eastern Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.“Peter was a singular voice in our faculty meetings ” said Michael D. Smith  dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “Imbued with a deep knowledge of Harvard’s history  his perspective always reflected an attention to the weight of history. No one understood better than he what it means to be a thoughtful and ethical participant in powerful institutional traditions.”Gomes preached and lectured across North America and the British Isles.  In 2010  he gave The Princeton Lectures on Youth  Church  and Culture.  Harvard University in 2010 elected him Honorary President of theAlpha-Iota Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.  In 2009  he gave The Lowell Lectures of Massachusetts.In 2007  he was named a member of theMost Venerable Orderof the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem  the oldest order of chivalry in Britain.In 2005  he presented a series of sermons in St. Edmundsbury Cathedral  England; in 2004 he gave the convocation address at Harvard Divinity School; and in 2003 he delivered the Lyttelton Addresses atEton College  England. In 2000  he delivered the University Sermon before theUniversity of Cambridgeand the Millennial Sermon inCanterbury Cathedral. In 1998  he presented the Lyman Beecher Lectures atYale Divinity School.He also preached at the inauguration ofDeval L. Patrickas governor of Massachusetts.Born in Boston in 1942 to Peter L. and Orissa White Gomes  Gomes was educated in the Plymouth  Mass.  public schools. He graduated fromBates Collegewith an A.B. degree in 1965  and he received the S.T.B. degree from Harvard Divinity School in 1968. That year  he was ordained to the Christian ministry by theFirst Baptist Church of Plymouth.From 1968 to 1970  Gomes was an instructor in history and director of the Freshman Experimental Program at Tuskegee Institute  Ala. There he also served as a church organist and choirmaster. He came to the Memorial Church as assistant minister in 1970. He became acting minister in 1972  and in 1974 was named the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Minister in the Memorial Church. In this capacity  he acted as the University’s leading religious officer and spiritual adviser.Gomes’ teaching and research interests included the history of the ancient Christian church  the Bible  homiletics  worship  and the history of the black American experience. He served as acting director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard from 1989 to 1991.The former president of theSignet Society  Harvard’s oldest literary group  Gomes published eleven volumes of sermons as well as numerous articles and papers. In 1996  he published “The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart ” which became a best-seller. Gomes described it to theBoston Globeas a book about the Bible “for the average intelligent lay audience  not for seminarians or Divinity School colleagues.” In it  Gomes analyzes the historical efforts to misuse the Bible to marginalize Jews  blacks  women  and gays.A self-described cultural conservative  Gomes stunned the Harvard community and reluctantly made national news when he came out as a homosexual in 1991 in response to gay bashing on campus. “I don’t like being the main exhibit  but this was an unusual set of circumstances  in that I felt I had a particular resource that nobody else there possessed ” he told The New Yorker in 1996.“I’m always seen as a black man and now I’m seen as a black gay man. If you throw the other factors in there that make me peculiar and interesting — the Yankee part  the Republican part  the Harvard type — all that stuff confuses people who have to have a single stereotypical lens in order to assure themselves they have a grasp on reality ” he said in an interview with theBoston Heraldin 1996.Gomes served as a trustee of theRoxbury Latin School. He was also a member of theMassachusetts Historical Society  theColonial Society of Massachusetts  and the Advisory Board of theWinterthur Museum  and a sometime fellow of theRoyal Society of Arts  London. He had been a trustee of Wellesley College  thePublic Broadcasting Service  and Bates College.  He is past president and trustee ofThe Pilgrim Society  Plymouth  Mass.He is survived by his cousin  Marjorie Daly  and her children  George R. Daly and Viana Daly.A memorial service celebrating the life and ministry of The Rev. Peter J.

C. Conrad Wright  renowned scholar of American Unitarianism  dies,C. Conrad Wright  Professor of American Church History Emeritus at Harvard Divinity School (HDS)  died peacefully at home in his sleep on Feb. 17  2011  at the age of 94.Wright was a prominent scholar of American Unitarianism  and he had a significant relationship with and effect on HDS during his 33-year career.Born on Feb. 9  1917  in Cambridge  Mass.  Wright was the son of C.H.C. Wright  a professor of French at Harvard  and his wife  Elizabeth Woodman Wright. He attended Browne and Nichols School  graduated from Harvard College in 1937  and went on to earn an M.A. in 1942 and a Ph.D. in 1946 from Harvard. He was awarded an L.H.D. from the Meadville Theological School in 1968 and from the Starr King School for the Ministry in 2004.Wright was a member  regular attendee  occasional preacher  and clerk at First Parish in Cambridge (Unitarian Universalist)  the congregation in which he had grown up. He later served as treasurer at the stately church  which dates back to the founding days of Harvard. Active in denominational affairs as well  he was a frequent consultant on matters of history and polity. In addition  Wright was president of the Unitarian Historical Society from 1962 until its 1968 merger with the Universalist Historical Society  and he was the longtime editor of its journal  theProceedings of the Unitarian Universalist Historical Society.Wright was John Bartlett Lecturer on New England Church History in addition to being Professor of Church History. He researched and wrote extensively on the history of Harvard and the Divinity School. He believed that the diversity and pluralism that the Divinity School enjoys today is in line with the openness of the School’s founders.“He was as committed to Unitarian Universalism as he was to the School and University ” said David D. Hall  Bartlett Research Professor of New England Church History at HDS. “Generous and exacting at one and the same time  Conrad set the standard for writing about his tradition and its place in the broader religious and cultural history of our country. And when his career was feted in the early 1990s  former students fondly recalled his presence at their ordinations.”

May was born on November 19  1928  in Fort Worth  Texas  the child of an American father and a Mexican-American mother who was descended from one of the great Hispanic families of Texas.  Spanish was the second among the many languages Ernest would learn.  His childhood was not always easy  and his path to scholarly excellence was very much self-made.  He studied at the University of California at Los Angeles  where he received both his bachelor’s degree (1948) and a doctorate (1951). He then served in the Navy briefly before coming to Harvard University as an assistant professor of history in 1954.  He was tenured five years later  when he was not quite thirty years old. For more than fifty years  he taught courses on the history of U.S. foreign relations as well as on more specialized topics such as the history of the Vietnam War and of civil-military relations.  He also offered graduate seminars and participated in the core curriculum  where he jointly taught with his colleagues a survey of modern international history.He was an enormously popular lecturer  and his students to this day retain a memory of him as he would walk into the classroom  throw his overcoat and his hat on a chair  and start a rapid narrative and analysis even before he got to the podium.  He spoke without notes and was an eloquent lecturer  citing official data and occasional anecdotes from all countries.  He was also a tireless  conscientious teacher of graduate students  of whom he demanded nothing but the best—which often meant asking them to read documents in languages that they had not yet learned. When students sought him out for advice  he listened patiently and tried to help.  From the 1970s  May divided his time between the History Department and the newly established Institute of Politics  which later became part of the Kennedy School of Government. He led the faculty study group there for many years and taught several courses  the most popular of which was on the use and misuse of history by policymakers.  Toward the end of his life  he was supervising a number of doctoral dissertations at the Kennedy School as well as in the History Department.How policymakers arrived at their decisions was an abiding scholarly concern of May’s  who published six books and countless articles on the subject.  His first book  published in 1959  dealt with President Woodrow Wilson’s decision to intervene in the Great War.  His second and third focused on the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of the Philippines  both heralding the United States’ arrival as a world (and  briefly  colonial) power.  His fourth was on the making of the Monroe Doctrine  and his fifth was on the use and misuse of history—“lessons of the past”—by policymakers.  May’s last single-authored book  Strange Victory  published in 2000  examined how Hitler came to choose the successful attack through the Ardennes rather than repeating the strategy of 1914 as he prepared for the invasion of France in 1940  and conversely how the French disastrously failed to process the intelligence warnings they received. In addition to these single-authored monographs  May co-authored a number of books and articles.  One of the earliest was The Ultimate Decision: The President as Commander in Chief (1960)  in which he wrote four of the nine chapters.  Several other books were written with his colleagues at the Kennedy School  including Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers  which he produced jointly with Richard Neustadt on the basis of a course they ran together  and The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis  which May edited with Philip Zelikow.No historian of his generation matched May in the multi-linguistic  multi-layered study of decision-making.  None so successfully bridged the chasm between serious historical study and policy-making.  In working with colleagues and students at the Kennedy School and in the government  he was fascinated by the fact that the form of analysis most frequently used by policymakers was historical reasoning.  Dismayed by the frequency with which sloppy reasoning produced misleading lessons  he was determined to demonstrate how this form of analysis could illuminate and inform policy choices.  Moreover  from the early 1960s onward  the Vietnam War became a focal point in May’s scholarship and teaching.  He was particularly sensitive to domestic politics as well as inter-agency rivalry and the role of diplomatic and military intelligence.  Over the course of his long career  we believe  he became a reflective and far-ranging observer both of government and life in general.May served as dean of the College during 1969-1971  at one the University’s particularly turbulent moments (he was in the Dean’s office when undergraduates occupied University Hall)  and as chair of the History Department during 1976-1979.  Outside the University  May led an extremely active life. He helped organize  or was a participant in  numerous international scholarly conferences that took him to Europe  Mexico  and Japan  as well as to all parts of the United States.  He served on many professional committees—often chairing them—such as the American Historical Association’s committee on American-East Asian relations that produced important publications long before scholarly exchange with the People’s Republic of China started.  He was honored by his professional colleagues when he was chosen as president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations and received a distinguished scholar’s award from the AHA.  He likewise willingly devoted himself to public service.  At the height of the Cold War  he helped prepare a still-classified historical study of the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms competition  and  after the Cold War was over  he served as a senior advisor to the 9/11 Commission as it tried to understand contemporary terrorism.May’s students  colleagues in and out of the University  and all those who have worked with him remember him as a quiet  gentle  kind human being who always maintained his serenity.  He is survived by his wife  Susan  and by three children  Rachel  John  and Donna.Respectfully submitted Graham AllisonCharles MaierPhilip ZelikowAkira Iriye  Chair
Carroll E. Wood  Jr.,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on February 1  2011  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Carroll E. Wood  Jr.  Professor of Biology  Emeritus  brought a mind of great precision to the field of plant systematics  focusing on the diverse flora of the southeastern United States.  Making use of the unexcelled resources at Harvard—which include the largest private herbarium in the world  several outstanding botanical libraries  the extensive living collections of the Arnold Arboretum  and many specialized collections in paleobotany  economic botany  and plant anatomy—he developed a broad biological approach to plant description that emphasized the genus rather than the species as the unit of study.  The result of his work was a floristic synthesis of the diverse flora of the southeastern United States  ranging both latitudinally and altitudinally from the Carolinas to Florida and westwards to include Arkansas and Louisiana.Wood is remembered affectionately by his students for his encyclopedic knowledge and seriousness of purpose  which were leavened in the classroom by his mischievous  sometimes wry  humor  comic anecdotes  and play on words.  In recognition of his editorial precision in matters of style and grammar  his associates awarded him the title of “Supervisor of Punctuation.”  Yet  for someone who was dedicated to sound scholarship  botantical order  and semantic precision  his office was a curious masterpiece of untidiness  referred to by his students as “Wood’s Hole.”Wood grew up in Salem  Virginia  where his father was a pharmacist and his mother was a teacher.  His early interest in natural history  which was encouraged by his parents  evolved after high school  into an inclination towards botany but with a sustained interest in butterflies  first as an undergraduate at Roanoke College and subsequently as a Masters student at the University of Pennsylvania.  During this period  he was already collecting extensively  working on a local county flora with a special emphasis on carnivorous plants.  His academic career was interrupted by military service with distinction in Europe towards the end of World War II  although he continued to collect plants—in military uniform—during periods of leave.  Upon returning to graduate school  he rapidly completed a Ph.D.  working at the University of California at Berkeley and under Professor Merritt Fernald at Harvard University.Having already established a large network of fellow botanists throughout the United States  he first took a position as Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina and then began his long affiliation with Harvard as Associate Curator at the Arnold Arboretum  rising to Professor in 1972.  His innovative research project  the Generic Flora of the Southeastern United States  which continues to this day  takes a biological approach to the description of plants involving all aspects of biology  including their evolutionary history  ecology  geographic distribution  and economic uses.  Funded extensively from external sources  the project requires a contributor to look deeply into the biology of a plant group throughout its total range.  Although Wood wrote many of the early descriptions himself  he soon recruited a host of collaborators  including graduate and postdoctoral students  his herbarium colleagues inside Harvard  and professional colleagues from outside institutions.  Over time  his involvement became increasingly editorial  a suitable application of his extensive botanical knowledge and his insistence on the precise application of style and grammar.  A selection of drawings from the Generic Flora of the Southeastern United States  based on Wood’s dissections of fresh or fluid preserved material  was published as a Student’s Atlas of Flowering Plants.  Perhaps his most visible legacy was Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach  a textbook of plant classification produced by a cohort of his students whom he had shepherded into the modern era of molecular and phylogenetic systematics.  His knowledge of the principles of plant nomenclature was deployed internationally and recent botanical monographers have used his generic approach for large tropical families.As a teacher  Wood was known for accommodating individual student needs through personalized tutorials  his enthusiasm for field study (especially at the Arnold Arboretum)  and his willingness to make material available at all hours for his courses in plant systematics.  This tradition of the open laboratory still continues in the Herbarium.  Wood was affiliated with several scientific societies  notably the New England Botanical Society.In retirement  Wood continued his editorial work in the company of his cat  named Birnham.  He also remained interested in horticulture  an enthusiasm originally nurtured by his mother  becoming a valued source of information about gardens and gardening among his friends and neighbors in Boston’s South End.  An avid hiker  he climbed to the top of Mount Washington in his late eighties.  When Carroll Wood died of a heart attack at the age of eighty-eight  people of all walks of life mourned his passing  but remember him with great affection.  He is survived by one brother but left no issue.Respectfully submitted Robert E.

Abelmann  professor of medicineemeritusatHarvard Medical School(HMS) and member of the faculty of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences Technology (HST)  died on Jan. 6. He was 89.Abelmann was born in Frankfurt-am-Main  Germany  in 1921. After being educated in Switzerland  he immigrated to the United States in 1939. He received an A.B. from Harvard in 1943 and an M.D. from theUniversity of Rochesterin 1946.Abelmann’s research focused on the physiology and the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system  and led to the recognition and definition of the high cardiac output states in patients with cirrhosis of the liver  bacterial pneumonia  disorders of the blood  and nutritional deficiencies. He published more than 260 scientific papers and edited several books. In addition  Abelmann was a consultant to several Boston-area hospitals and universities.At HMS  Abelmann taught basic as well as clinical courses  including pathophysiology  physical diagnosis  internal medicine  and cardiology. He also introduced a system of evaluating courses. His teaching rounds stressed the mechanisms of disease  the underlying scientific basis of manifestations  and of therapy. He formed close relationships with many of his postgraduate students and fellows  and was very proud of the leadership positions they attained. Many of the 68 fellows he trained in clinical and investigative cardiology became professors  chiefs of cardiology  and heads of cardiovascular societies.In his retirement years  Abelmann remained active in HST  taught a popular undergraduate seminar atMITtitled “The Art and Science of Medicine ” edited the HST newsletter “The Connection ” and  until 2006  was director of HST alumni affairs.He is survived by his wife  Rena; sons Arthur and Charles; daughters Nancy  Ruth  and Karen Gross; and nine grandchildren.Contributions in his memory may be made to the Walter H.

Max R. Hall  writer and editor  100,Max R. Hall  a former journalist  writer  teacher of writing  and scholarly book editor  died in Cambridge on Jan. 12 at 100 years of age. Until his retirement  Hall was editor at Harvard’sWeatherhead Center for International Affairs  social sciences editor atHarvard University Press  and editorial adviser atHarvard Business School.A native of Atlanta  Hall moved to Cambridge in 1960 with his family after living in Washington  D.C.  and New York. Hall spent 20 years as a journalist  including nine years at theAssociated Press  and a year as a Nieman Foundation fellow in journalism at Harvard. Hall attendedEmory University  and received an honorary doctorate of letters from there in 1995.Hall loved the Charles River  printing  publishing  and Benjamin Franklin  and he wrote books on all of these topics. His books include “The Charles: The People’s River ” “Harvard University Press: A History ” “An Embarrassment of Misprints: Comical and Disastrous Typos of the Centuries ” and “Benjamin Franklin & Polly Baker: The History of a Literary Deception.” He wrote numerous articles for Harvard Magazine as one of its contributing editors.His respect for clear writing was profound  and he passed this passion on to many scholarly authors whom he mentored at Harvard. Combining his journalist’s values of plain  down-to-earth writing with an unfailing ability to take the reader’s point of view  Hall taught authors that no idea is too complicated to be expressed simply and that any misunderstandings or slowdowns (which he called “snags”) are the author’s fault  not the reader’s. Many professors gave him credit not only for helping them become better writers but for making a significant contribution to their careers.Hall  a widower  is survived by three children  Clay ’69  Nancy  and Judy ’67  Ph.D. ’76; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. on April 16 at Cambridge Friends Meeting House  5 Longfellow Park  Cambridge.

Medical School’s Jocelyn Spragg  70,Jocelyn Spragg  faculty director of diversity programs and special academic resources in the division of medical sciences atHarvard Medical School(HMS)  as well as a research scientist  educator  mentor  and tireless promoter of educational opportunities for underrepresented students  died Nov. 2 at her home in Jamaica Plain  Mass. She was 70.Spragg was born in New York and raised in Rochester. She earned her bachelor’s degree at Smith College and moved to Boston in 1962 to pursue her Ph.D. She received a master’s degree in pharmacology and a Ph.D. in bacteriology and immunology from Harvard. Spragg joined the HMS faculty in 1972  where she enjoyed a highly successful first career as a research scientist making seminal discoveries about the kallikrein-kinin system. Her former research mentor  Frank Austen  notes  “Working with Jocelyn was exciting because of her imagination. Her move into an entirely different role as career innovator … found her even happier and more fulfilled.” Characteristic of her lifelong history of mentoring  two of her former trainees became leaders in the kallikrein-kinin field.Her foray into formal teaching and program innovation began at theRadcliffe Institute for Advanced Studywhen an instructor for the Radcliffe Summer Program in Science suddenly resigned. Understanding the importance of increasing the number of women in science and medicine  Spragg helped develop a curriculum to expose young women in high school to the sciences and to introduce them to women who were in leadership roles.As her interest in developing programs for minority students grew  she pursued a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Boston University  graduating in 1992  and served first as faculty coordinator (1991-98) and then as faculty director (1998-10) of diversity programs and special academic resources in the division of medical sciences at HMS. Encouraged by her longtime mentor and friend  Harold Amos  she developed one of the premier summer research programs in the country  theSummer Honors Undergraduate Research Program(SHURP). Through this program she provided hundreds of minority students and students from small schools with research opportunities.Spragg participated in numerous external advisory boards  was a regular speaker at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students  and was one of the founding summer program directors of the Leadership Alliance. Spragg was awarded HMS’s Harold Amos Faculty Diversity Award in recognition of her accomplishments.A consummate teacher and mentor to students  colleagues  and friends of all ages  “Momma Spragg ” as she was affectionately referred to by some of her former SHURP students  was always there to impart her guidance  wisdom  and tough love.Spragg also enjoyed traveling  and spent her 68th birthday camping in the Moroccan desert.  She was also an accomplished horticulturist and served as treasurer of theNew England Daylily Societyfor the past 15 years.She is survived by her brother  Roger Spragg  and family. A memorial service honoring her will be held in January. Contributions in memory of Jocelyn Spragg and in support of underrepresented minority students may be made to Harvard University with a memo line stating “In Remembrance of Jocelyn Spragg ” and sent to Beth Thompson  Assistant Dean  Development Services  Harvard University  FAS Development Office  124 Mt. Auburn Street  3rd Floor  Cambridge  MA 02138.
Michael Tinkham  superconductivity pioneer  82,Michael “Mike” Tinkham  the Rumford Professor of Physics and Gordon McKay Professor of Applied PhysicsEmeritusat theHarvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciencesand theDepartment of Physics  passed away on Nov. 4. He was 82 years old.Born on Feb. 23  1928  in Green Lake County  Wis.  Tinkham earned his undergraduate degree at Ripon College in 1951 and his master’s and Ph.D. degrees  both in physics  at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He also spent a year at the Clarendon Laboratory of Oxford as a postdoctoral fellow.He joined the University of California  Berkeley  in 1957  rising to full professor  and then left in 1966 for Harvard  where he remained for the rest of his career.Tinkham’s research focused primarily on superconductivity  as captured in his classic text  “Introduction to Superconductivity.”In his later years he was active in studying the unique properties of materials when sample dimensions are reduced to the nanometer range.In the Journal of Superconductivity  Tinkham’s former student Christopher Lobb  Ph.D. ’80  wrote: “The opportunity to work with Mike … was one of the greatest experiences of my life. As a researcher  Mike’s rare combination of experimental and theoretical ability has kept him at the top of the field for decades.“As a teacher  Mike worked constantly to make things understandable  and did so with enthusiasm and wit. Any success I’ve had since leaving his group has largely been due to what I learned from him …”Tinkham’s awards and honors included election to the National Academy of Sciences; the receipt of the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize; and the Fred E. Saalfeld Award for Outstanding Lifetime Achievement in Science in 2005.
David Turnbull,David Turnbull was a physical chemist who played a prominent role in the emergence of materials science as a multi-disciplinary field  to which he contributed a comprehensive understanding of the rates of phase transformations in liquids and solids.He was born on February 12  1915  on a farm in northwestern Illinois that is still owned by his family.  He loved the farming life  but an early asthmatic condition made him unfit for some of the work  which led his parents to steer him toward higher education.  He got a degree in Chemistry from Monmouth College in Illinois  and went on to the University of Illinois in Urbana  where he got his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1939.He then joined the Faculty at the Case School of Applied Science where  during World War II  he trained naval cadets and did research on synthetic rubber and on the improvement of additives for heavy-duty lubricants.  In Cleveland he met Carol Cornell  whom he married in 1946 and who remained his loving and supporting companion till her death in 1999.In late 1946  Turnbull joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady  N.Y.  as one of the first members of the group of Herbert Hollomon  who was forming a multi-disciplinary team with representation from metallurgy  applied mechanics  chemistry  and physics to attack the problems posed by responses of metals to mechanical and thermal treatments.  By the early 1950s Hollomon’s group  together with a few others  such as William Shockley’s group at Bell Laboratories and Cyril Smith’s Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago  was demonstrating the power of the multi-disciplinary approach to materials research and advancing the recognition of “Materials Science” as what was then called a “superdiscipline.”In 1962  Turnbull joined the Harvard University faculty as Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics in the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics (now the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences).  Again  it was the special multi-disciplinary character of the Division under then-Dean Harvey Brooks that attracted him to Harvard over other academic offers he had at the time. It was the only university he visited where there would be no organizational barriers between him and his new colleagues: the physicists Harvey Brooks and Nico Bloembergen   the metallurgist Bruce Chalmers and the applied mechanician Bernard Budiansky were all in a single Division.  Turnbull continued to be a source of inspiration and advice to his younger colleagues  whom he encouraged to cross the bridges between their fields.David Turnbull was a master teacher.  Some who knew him may find that statement surprising: as a lecturer  he was no great orator  nor an entertainer.  And yet  the many who attended his classic graduate course on kinetics of phase transformations  which he taught for twenty-five years  remember it as one of the best they ever took. There was  of course  his unique and deep insight into the subject. But he also knew  pedagogically  that a real grasp of a subject only comes from working with it  which is why assigning many well-thought-out  challenging problems was his most effective teaching tool.  Turnbull was also committed to improving undergraduate teaching.  He developed  and taught for several years  the thermodynamics part of an introductory physics course  much beloved by its alumni  where students learned from hands-on experimentation in small groups.Turnbull had an unusual ability to discern the specific strength of each student  and to provide a nurturing environment for each one to take advantage of that strength.  Those with a green thumb in the laboratory  he encouraged to try innovative experiments; to those with a lively imagination  he suggested problems worth modeling; those with a mathematical bent  he let loose to see where the latest in computational power could take them. For several of his students he was the second or third advisor—the one who finally recognized their special talent and who had the patience to let it come to fruition.But what all his alumni remember most about David as an advisor are his human qualities: his wisdom  his quiet integrity  his infinite patience  the breadth of his knowledge—from baseball to ancient history—and the warm welcome that David and Carol made for students at their home.Turnbull’s scientific life achievement is a comprehensive  quantitative view of the many factors that govern the kinetics of phase transformations in condensed matter.  The list of specifics is long.  He made an apparently intractable stochastic phenomenon like crystal nucleation yield to quantitative experimentation and analysis. He showed that a liquid has a structure of its own  unrelated to that of crystals  as many had thought. He predicted  successfully  that all liquids could be made into glasses  and drew up a widely used  intuitively appealing picture of how this happens. He made sense of the fast and short-circuit diffusion phenomena that were clouding our understanding of how atoms move in crystals. He understood more deeply than anyone the wealth of ways in which crystals grow.When  in 1986  he received the first Japan Prize in materials science for his pioneering work on metallic glass  which had led to the development of the most efficient electrical transformers we have today  there could not have been a more worthy awardee of the most prestigious prize in the field.David Turnbull died at his home in Cambridge on April 28  2007.  Until shortly before  he had continued to come to his office  visit the lab  and attend seminars. He will be fondly remembered both as a remarkable person and an outstanding scientist.He leaves two sons  a daughter  and four grandsons.Respectfully submitted Michael J. AzizDavid R. NelsonFrans A.

Fakhri A. Bazzaz,Fakhri A. Bazzaz  H. H. Timkin Professor of Science from 1984 to 1997 and then Mallinckodt Professor of Biology from 1997 until his retirement in 2004  passed away on February 6  2008  of complications following a stroke.  A giant in the field of plant ecology  Bazzaz transformed the study of plant population biology through his deep knowledge of plant physiology.  The dominant theme throughout his career was that of how plants respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbance  from the classical area of plant succession—how plant communities succeed one another over time—to the impacts of global climate change on the productivity and stability of ecosystems.  Bazzaz’s landmark studies of old-field succession broke with the descriptive paradigm that dominated mid-twentieth century plant ecology and established a modern experimental approach grounded in mechanistic understanding of plant physiology and community interactions.  He played an equally important role in the study of climate change  conducting far-reaching work on the mechanisms by which plants  plant communities  and ecosystems respond to elevated carbon dioxide and other global change factors such as increases in temperature and nitrogen deposition.  Bazzaz was invited by Vice-President (then Senator) Al Gore to testify before Congress in 1992  and he was a signatory of a scientific letter to President Clinton in 1997  advising serious and careful attention to global climate change.  His long and productive career is recorded in nearly 300 scientific papers  18 book chapters  and 6 books  while his lasting impact on the field of ecology is reflected in the careers of his 56 graduate students  36 postdoctoral fellows  and 17 undergraduate research students.Fakhri Bazzaz was born in Baghdad  Iraq  on June 16  1933  to a family prominent in public service.  He studied biology at Baghdad University  obtaining his undergraduate degree in 1953.  An Iraqi government scholarship for postgraduate study allowed him to complete both his M.Sc. (1960) and Ph.D. (1963) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  under the supervision of Professor Lawrence Bliss.  After two years as a Lecturer at Baghdad University  he returned to an assistant professor position at the University of Illinois  rising through the ranks to full professor  head of the department of plant biology  and acting director of the School of Life Sciences.The agricultural landscape of central Illinois  with its patchwork of abandoned fields  formed a natural laboratory in which Bazzaz first made his mark on ecology.  As such “old fields” give way to increasingly taller and more perennial vegetation  Bazzaz recognized that the process of species replacement was governed by the life history characteristics of individual species.  In doing so  he transformed what had been a purely phenomenological line of inquiry into a predictive  hypothesis-driven science.  Bazzaz used field  glasshouse  and laboratory experiments to test hypotheses of how the underlying mechanisms by which plants compete for resources influence community interactions.  Bazzaz was the first to understand that plasticity is itself a trait under selection and to study how variation in allocation to roots  leaves  and especially reproductive structures influences competitive interactions.  His infusion of physiological mechanism into plant population biology and his insistence on integrating the entire plant life cycle—from germination through to seed production—placed him at the vanguard of the nascent field of plant physiological ecology.Bazzaz’s move to Harvard University in 1984 coincided with an increasing focus on the study of climate change.  He was among the first ecologists to recognize not only the significance of such anthropogenic impacts on natural ecosystems  but also their complexity.  While other scientists were content to document the impact of elevated carbon dioxide on the growth of individual plants  Bazzaz realized that climate change had the potential to alter interactions between species and even to decrease plant diversity.  He documented how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could have far-reaching impacts on ecological communities due to differential effects on the reproductive allocation of plants and the altered nutritional quality of plant tissues.  In particular  Bazzaz’s research showed how the effects of climate change on plants could cascade through the food chain  affecting communities of pollinators and herbivores with important consequences for human health.  He recognized the need to study interactions between rising carbon dioxide concentrations and other aspects of global change such as nitrogen deposition and increases in temperature.  He spoke eloquently and with great fervor about the dangers of climate change.  Bazzaz’s contributions to humanity are reflected in his scientific work  which lays bare the potential impacts of climate change on plant communities and the consequences for human well-being of failing to respond to such a serious and self-induced threat.Bazzaz was an energetic and dedicated teacher  who inspired a generation of young ecologists.  His commitment to students was reflected in the tightly organized and effective lab group that was the hallmark of his leadership style.  He took immense pride in his students’ success  both personal and professional  and considered their continued work an important part of his legacy.Throughout his career  Fakhri Bazzaz received many honors  including election as a Fellow of Clare Hall of Cambridge University (1981)  the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1987)  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1989)  and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (1993).  He was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 1988  the Humboldt Forschungspreis in 1996  and the Desert Research Institute’s “Nevada Medal” in 2004.  Bazzaz received a founding membership in the Iraqi National Academy of Science in 2003  and he helped found the Arab Science and Technology Foundation and served on its Advisory Board.  He is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years  Maarib Bakri Bazzaz  his daughter Sahar Bazzaz of Cambridge  Massachusetts  and his son Ammar Bazzaz of Chino  California.Respectfully submitted David R.

James Stemble Duesenberry,James S. Duesenberry  William Joseph Maier Professor of Money and Banking Emeritus  and a member of the Harvard Economics Department for more than half a century  died on October 5  2009.  We miss him.  Jim’s spirit of curious but skeptical intellectual inquiry  of willingness to pitch in when work needed to be done  and of concern for making both Harvard University and the world at large a better place – all with wit and humor  and a wealth of engaging stories that he loved to tell – influenced for the better this university and many of the people who comprise it.A native of West Virginia  Jim Duesenberry studied economics at the University of Michigan and came to Harvard in 1946 with his wartime military service in the Pacific behind him and his Ph.D. dissertation already well along.  The resulting book Income  Saving  and the Theory of Consumer Behavior  published in 1949  immediately catapulted him into the economics profession’s front rank of leading young scholars.  Jim argued that in deciding how much to spend or save  people looked not just to their current incomes but to benchmarks like what they had spent in the past  or what they saw others spending.  The “relative income hypothesis ” as the idea became known  attracted enormous attention.  To Jim’s amusement  in recent years it has enjoyed a significant revival of interest among economists  often younger people who had no idea that Jim was still living and still active professionally.  (A 2005 article in theNew York Timespointing to this anomalywas headlined “The Mysterious Disappearance of James Duesenberry.”)  Today the relative income hypothesis is a key underpinning of several important strands of economic theorizing.  Indeed  Jim could well be considered the founder of the rapidly growing field now called “behavioral economics.”In the 1950s and 1960s Jim devoted much of his professional energy to trying to understand why the economy fluctuates  and what economic policy can do to ameliorate the downturns and moderate the excesses.  His 1958 bookBusiness Cycles and Economic Growthexamined these problems from a viewpoint that took careful account of the institutional setting in which individuals  business executives and government policymakers interact  and the resulting constraints on their actions.  (What he had to say about the role of “easy credit” in triggering “speculative booms” reads well today as a description of the makings of the 2008-2009 crisis in the U.S.)  From then on  Jim’s real interest in economics was in how economic policy  especially monetary and fiscal policy  can help mitigate economic downturns and curb excesses.While Jim was always fascinated by difficult-to-explain facts or clever analytical insights  what mattered to him was using the tools of economic policy to make the world better for ordinary citizens.  It seemed only natural that he played an active role in public policymaking as well.  During 1966-1968 he served on the Council of Economic Advisers in Washington  and after his return to Harvard he served as chairman of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  chairman of the presidential commission on mortgage lending  chairman of the Massachusetts savings banks’ insurance trust  and in many other similar positions besides.  But while Jim took the issues and the work seriously  he never took himself seriously.  He often joked that what really scared him was that the people in charge were looking tohimfor answers.The third phase of Jim’s work in economics grew out of his increasing sense that financial markets and financial institutions matter importantly for how economic policies work and why the economy behaves as it does.  Beginning in the 1970s  Jim  mostly in collaboration with Barry Bosworth  explored the relationships between production  employment  incomes  and profits on one side and  on the other  borrowing  lending  and investing.  Part of the motivation was his sense that most business downturns  in economies like the United States  are triggered by events in the financial markets.  (As the most recent episode sharply reminded us  they still are.)Finally  beginning in the mid 1980s Jim devoted an increasing share of his attention to the challenges of economic development.  During the latter years when he was still teaching  and even more so once he retired in 1989  he enjoyed traveling to lower-income countries to talk with policymakers  academics  bankers  and anybody else interested in the role that a developing country’s financial markets play in whether it actually develops or not.  At that time  bringing modern monetary economics to bear on the practical problems of economic development provided a fresh and important perspective.  Jim was among the earliest Americans to teach Western economics in China  once doing so was permitted again following the Deng Xiaoping reforms  spending a month lecturing at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu (the capital of Sichuan province) in 1985.  A younger member of the department who lectured there twenty years later was welcomed as a colleague of Professor Duesenberry’s and was regaled with stories of his visit.Jim’s service to Harvard and the broader community ran well beyond the narrowly academic.  He chaired the Harvard Economics Department from 1972 to 1977  a difficult period when the department grappled with intellectual divisions stemming from the political strains of the time.  Jim also served for more than two decades as a town meeting member in Belmont – a position for which he at first campaigned door-to-door – representing Precinct 1  historically Belmont’s most liberal district.  For ten of these years he was a member of the town’s Warrant Committee (the finance committee).  He was also an active member of Belmont’s Unitarian Universalist church  shouldering his share and more of the day-to-day work that any such institution requires – so much so that Reverend Carpenter  after Jim’s death  referred to him as that rarest of creatures: a man who enjoys committee work.But throughout  Jim never lost his interest in the central focus of his work in economics: the ongoing challenges facing monetary and fiscal policy.  Among his Harvard colleagues  he was always eager to discuss whatever was the most problematic issue of the day.  Until the very end of his life  he participated regularly in meetings of the economic advisory panel of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  In time he became the oldest active member of the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity.  His persistent approach was that understanding the current situation was of course necessary  but what really mattered was having something to say about what should therefore be done.At Harvard Jim was also a teacher.  It was in small-group classes and seminars that he stood out  giving the discussion an intensity one would not have expected from his mild manner in ordinary conversation.  But with his dry  sometimes mordant  English-style wit  that intensity was never overbearing.  He was as likely to quote Gilbert and Sullivan or A. A. Milne  as any economist.  He especially delighted in stories  and whenever possible he would use one to make his point.  Jim was also highly effective as a one-on-one adviser.  His analytical insight was acute  and his judgment was consistently sound.  In addition to his students at Harvard  he attracted followers wherever he traveled.  His several visits to Japan  for example  created a close relationship between the economics departments at Harvard and Kobe Universities that continues to this day.  Economics departments around the world  as well as central banks  finance ministries  and financial regulatory bodies  are filled with his students and advisees.And Jim was devoted – completely devoted – to his wife Margaret  a violinist and music teacher  and their four children.  Attending Marg’s concerts  often helping to hand out the printed programs  was a major part of his life.  So was reading to his children.  Marg died nearly two years before Jim  not long before what was to have been their 60thwedding anniversary.  Their son Keith predeceased both of them.  Their son John and daughters Holly and Peggy  along with four grandchildren  survive him.
Reinhold Brinkmann  musicologist  76,Reinhold Brinkmann  a distinguished scholar whose writings on music of the 19th and 20th centuries made an indelible mark on musicology in Germany and the United States  died on Oct. 10  after a long illness  in Eckernförde  Germany. He was 76.Brinkmann taught in Harvard’sDepartment of Musicfrom 1985 until his retirement in 2003  serving as James Edward Ditson Professor of Music and department chair. He came to Harvard from Berlin  where he had been a professor at the Hochschule der Künste since 1980  and prior to that was professor of musicology at the University of Marburg. In 2001  he was the first musicologist to be awarded the prestigiousErnst von Siemens Music Prize.His writings span a broad range of topics  including the Second Viennese School (especially Schoenberg)  the Romantic Lied tradition  Wagner  Skryabin  Varèse  Eisler  and Ives. Brinkmann also lived and breathed new music  and enjoyed close friendships with Helmut Lachenmann  Wolfgang Rihm  and Luciano Berio  who dedicated his Sonata per Pianforte Solo to him in 2001. Brinkmann’s work combined intimate knowledge of the music  often shown in detailed  painstaking analyses  with an awareness of social and political backgrounds and ramifications. He published and edited many books and essays.He leaves behind his wife  Dorothea Brinkmann. The Department of Music will host a memorial for Brinkmann in the spring.
John Huchra  astronomer  dies at 61,John Peter Huchradied unexpectedly on Oct. 8 at the age of 61. He was the Robert O. & Holly Thomis Doyle Professor of Cosmology and the senior adviser to the provost for research policy at Harvard.“This news comes a deep shock to us all ” said Charles Alcock  director of theHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics(CfA). “John’s career was marked with distinction for his fundamental contributions to cosmology  his tireless and effective service and advocacy for astronomy  his dedication and brilliance as a teacher and mentor  his devotion to and care for students  and his warmth and humor.”Huchra came to the CfA in 1976 as a fellow  having received a B.S. fromMITand his Ph.D. fromthe California Institute of Technology. He was a Smithsonian astronomer from 1978 to 2005  when he became Harvard’s vice provost for research and policy. He was the director of theWhipple Observatoryfrom 1994 to 1998  and served as the interim director of the CfA in 2004.He recently completed his term as president of theAmerican Astronomical Society  and was a member of theNational Academy of Sciencesand theAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also served on the Decadal Survey Committee  which just released its report to help guide future investments by funding agencies in ground- and space-based astronomical facilities.Among his many accomplishments  Huchra was perhaps best known for his leadership  with his collaboratorMargaret Geller  of the CfARedshift Survey— a pioneering effort to map the large-scale structure of the universe. The survey uncovered a “Great Wall” of galaxies extending across 500 million light-years of space. This survey and others showed that we live in a “soap bubble” universe with galaxies clustering as though on the surfaces of giant bubbles separated by huge voids.Huchra made a number of other very important contributions to astronomy  including measurements of the Hubble constant and the discovery ofHuchra’s Lens  one of the most dramatic early examples of gravitational lensing.Huchra is survived by his wife  Rebecca M. Henderson  his parents  Mieccyslaw Huchra and Helen (Lewicki)  by a son  Harry  and by a sister  Christine.Friends and colleagues of Huchra are invited to a celebration of his life in science on Dec. 3 at 3 p.m. in room 104 of the Hilles Center  located at 59 Shepard St. in Cambridge. For those unable to attend  a webcast of the memorial is being arranged.A reception will follow at 4:30 p.m. in Phillips Auditorium at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics  60 Garden St. For more information  call 617.495.1490.
Brendan Arnold Maher,Brendan Maher combined  in near perfect balance  extraordinary intelligence  restrained skepticism  an uncanny ability to detect foolishness  and an inspiring style of leadership throughout a long  distinguished career. Brendan added to this quartet impeccable integrity  a wry sense of humor  and a wisdom that colleagues  collaborators  and   generations of students admired.  Brendan was at home in both the laboratory and the seminar room. Many doctoral students found in Brendan the paramount example of teacher  advisor  and scholar  and junior faculty appreciated his belief that senior faculty had a responsibility to their junior colleagues.Brendan’s scholarship centered on the complex theoretical and empirical problems surrounding human psychopathology  especially the mental illness known as schizophrenia. One of Brendan’s seminal contributions was to bring the experimental strategies of the laboratory to research in this domain. His 1966 monograph Principles of Psychopathology: An Experimental Approach  which was reprinted many times and translated into several languages  was a transformational work.Principlesprovided the intellectual and methodological framework for what would become the field of experimental psychopathology. Brendan insisted on the inherent value of counting phenomena rather than rating them in a subjective manner. He preferred to quantify the precise level of motor control in the hand movements of a patient with schizophrenia rather than rely on a global or subjective rating. This strategy created a paradigm shift in psychopathology research  replacing description and speculation with quantitative methods. It also provided the foundation for contemporary efforts to link specific genes for schizophrenia to less complex phenomena that could function as endophenotypes that mediated between the symptoms of the disease and the biology to which the genes contributed.Another major contribution was an explanation of delusional thinking. Brendan’s interpretations of delusions reflected an ability to transcend popular assumptions. Rather than regarding delusions as bizarre expressions of madness  Brendan realized that  in many cases  a delusion was the patient’s attempt to understand unusual personal experiences. In other words  delusions were not false beliefs that arose from defective inferential abilities. Rather  they reflected the patient’s efforts to make sense of anomalous personal internal or external experiences. A patient’s subjective experience that his thoughts were being broadcast to others might therefore foster the delusion that the FBI had implanted a radio transmitter in his brain.Brendan’s scholarship included many empirical reports  nine books or edited volumes  and service as editor for a journal and several influential volumes.  Brendan was instrumental in founding the Society for Research in Psychopathology in 1986 and served as its charter president.He was born in Lancashire in 1924  but his parents came to England from County Tipperary  Ireland. Hence  it is appropriate that he left us on St. Patrick’s Day in 2009.  Brendan joined the Royal Navy as an Ordinary Seaman  rose to the rank of Lieutenant  and was the navigating officer in the lead minesweeper during the D-Day invasion of Normandy  clearing a path for the troops that landed at Sword Beach. With his wife’s help  he chronicled that extraordinary day in a moving memoir  APassage to Sword Beach: Minesweeping in the Royal Navy. During a later assignment to clear the mines from Rotterdam harbor  one mine exploded as he was removing it from the water and wounded him seriously. An MRI scan conducted later in life revealed that some shrapnel from that explosion remained in his body.After the war  he attended Manchester University for his bachelor’s degree and then went to the Ohio State University on a Fulbright Scholarship for his Ph.D. in clinical psychology. It was there that he met the woman with whom he spent a mutually gratifying 56-year marriage. He completed his clinical internship at the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute  an affiliate of the University of Illinois Medical School  where he worked under the direc­tion of David Shakow  who was studying the nature of schizophrenia.After serving one year as a prison psychologist back in England  Brendan returned to Ohio State as an instructor  then to Northwestern University  Louisiana State University  and then to Harvard in 1960 as a Lecturer in the former Department of Social Relations. Brendan left Cambridge for eight years  first to go to the University of Wisconsin and then to Brandeis University as professor of psychology and  in succession  Dean of the Graduate School and Dean of the Faculty.  In a conversation shortly before his death  Brendan smiled when he spoke about his unusual position as an Irish dean of a Jewish-founded university. Brendan returned to Harvard as professor of personality in the newly reconfigured Department of Psychology  served as Chair on two occasions  and as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1989 to 1992. He retired in 2004 as the Edward C. Henderson Professor of the Psychology of Personality.  He received an honorary degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1991  and the Joseph Zubin Award for Distinguished Research in Psychopathology in 1998.Brendan Maher enjoyed the reputation of being an academic statesman of the first rank. He navigated the unpredictable straits of academia  while providing wise counsel to many colleagues  department chairs  university administrators  and students. This keen observer of the eccentricities of academic life wrote an essay on the meaning of quality in humanities scholarship titledFacts  Irish Facts  Mythofacts  and Interesting Possibilities which has become “required reading” for administrators.Brendan is survived by his wife  Winifred (Barbara) Brown Maher; five children; and five grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Irving Gottesman (University of Minnesota)Jill HooleyMark Lenzenweger (State University of New York at Binghamton)Richard McNallyJerome Kagan  Chair
Education scholar Gerald Lesser  84,Gerald Lesser  Charles Bigelow Professor of Education and Developmental PsychologyEmeritusat theHarvard Graduate School of Education(HGSE)  died on Sept. 23 at the age of 84.Lesser is perhaps most well-known as one of the scholars who  during his time at HGSE  developed the curriculum for the acclaimed PBS series “Sesame Street ” a show unparalleled in the history of television. Throughout his 30 years at HGSE  he continued to work on “Sesame Street” where he served as chairman of the Children’s Television Workshop’s board of advisers from 1969 through 1996. Lesser was determined to ensure the show’s value as a learning experience  establishing a strong culture of assessment and writing the 1974 book  “Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street.”“As a young assistant professor  I assigned Gerry Lesser’s work to my students because it illustrated the power of applied developmental science ” said DeanKathleen McCartney  the Gerald S. Lesser Professor in Early Childhood Development. “The first time I met Gerry Lesser  he joked that he was sorry to have saddled me with the name ‘Lesser Professor’; he also told me how proud he was that the dean of the School was serving in a chair that honored him. But I am the one who is proud to carry his name along with mine.”To read the full obituary  visit HGSE’swebsite.
John E. Murdoch  professor of history of science  83,John E. Murdoch  one of the world’s top scholars of ancient and medieval science  died Thursday (Sept. 16) at age 83. He had been a member of theHarvardfaculty since 1963  and professor of the history of science since 1967. He also taught atHarvard Extension Schoolfor six decades  and was a member of the School’s administrative board for more than 30 years.Murdoch was a renowned scholar of ancient Greek and medieval Latin science and philosophy  with a particular interest in the concepts of infinity and continuity throughout early science. He was the author of “Album of Science: Antiquity and the Middle Ages” (1984) and co-editor of “The Cultural Context of Medieval Learning” (1973). He also penned more than 60 scholarly essays on ancient and medieval science.Last year  Murdoch received his field’s highest honor when he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society  honoring lifetime scholarly achievement.“John took a hard-headed approach to the study of the hard sciences in the Middle Ages  always looking closely at what the texts said ” said longtime colleague Everett I. Mendelsohn  professor of the history of scienceemeritusat Harvard. “He took things seriously and took nothing for granted.”“John was also known for his very close work with his graduate students ” Mendelsohn added. “He pushed them hard  but was with them all the time.”A native of Milwaukee  Murdoch received his Ph.D. at theUniversity of Wisconsinin philosophy  with a minor field in the history of science  in 1957. He taught at Harvard from 1957 to 1960 and  after teaching three years atPrinceton University  returned as associate professor of the history of science in 1963. He served as chair of Harvard’sDepartment of the History of Sciencefrom 1966 to 1971 and 1974 to 1975.
Lunt  scholar of Slavic languages and literatures  dies at 91,Horace Gray Lunt  Samuel Hazzard Cross Professor of Slavic Languages and LiteraturesEmeritus passed away on Aug. 11 in Baltimore  Md.  scarcely a month short of his 92nd birthday.Born Horace Gray Lunt II in Colorado Springs  Colo.  on Sept. 12  1918  Lunt received his degreemagna cum laudein German in 1941 from Harvard  going on to become one of the world’s leading experts in Slavic philology and linguistics.At Harvard he was a member of the Slavic Department faculty from 1949 to 1989 and served as its chair from 1959 to 1974. Armed with considerable linguistic and analytic skills  Lunt was instrumental in reshaping Slavic philology in the United States in structuralist terms. He insisted on the highest standards of textual analysis  providing new pedagogical tools for the post-World War II generation of American Slavists  investigating understudied areas of Slavic linguistics  and indicating new projects for in-depth study in Slavic languages  literatures  and cultures. A staunch foe of nationalistic exploitation of language for political purposes  Lunt strove his entire career to ensure that linguistic argumentation rested on a rational  factual basis  countering any discussion based on nationalism or demagoguery. Lunt was a superlative teacher  providing his students  undergraduate as well as graduate  with abundant handouts  charts  texts  and textbooks to ensure comprehensive understanding of the subject matter at hand  with clarity and accuracy his guiding principles. His interests in Slavic languages were wide-ranging  from paleography  phonology  morphology  and syntax to etymology  sociolinguistics  history  literature  and religion  and he leaves behind a large bibliography of published books  articles  and reviews.Lunt was promoted from assistant professor to associate professor in 1954 and received a tenured full professorship in 1960  the same year he was named a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow. In 1973 he succeeded Roman Jakobson as the Samuel Hazzard Cross Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures.He is survived by Sally Herman Lunt  his wife of 47 years  daughters Elizabeth Gray Lunt and Catherine Lunt Greer  son-in-law David S. Friedman  and five grandchildren. A memorial commemoration of Lunt’s life and work will be held on Oct. 22  at 3 p.m. in the Fong Auditorium of Boylston Hall at Harvard University. A reception will follow in the Faculty Club.

Daniel Tosteson,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Medicine  May 20  2010  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Daniel Charles Tosteson  former Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine and Caroline Shields Walker Distinguished Professor of Cell Biology died on May 27  2009  after a long and courageous struggle with Parkinson’s disease. His 20 year’s leadership of the Harvard Medical Faculty was marked by innovation  change and renewal. His imprint on the Medical School will be felt for generations to come. The works of his stewardship included: a robust and revolutionary course-of-study for medical students; a vitalized graduate program in the medical sciences generally acknowledged for its excellence; exceptional appointments to leadership positions in basic and clinical departments; new initiatives in the social as well as the life sciences basic to medicine; improved and expanded physical facilities for teaching and research; and extraordinary increments to the Medical School’s resource base.Dan Tosteson was born in Milwaukee on February 5  1925. His father  Alexis  was a civil engineer and his mother  Dilys  was the youngest of 13 children born into a Welsh coal mining family that had immigrated to the United States. Dan had a childhood interest in sailing begun with a small center-board boat on Lake Michigan. A daring skipper  he once capsized and sank his craft; this did not deter him from a life-long love affair with the sea and sailing. At Wauwatosa High School he played quarterback on the football team. On matriculating at Harvard College in 1942  he continued to play football  seriously injuring one knee.One of us (AR)  started at Harvard College with Dan as Tuition Scholars working at the Harvard Union. Dan’s youthful enthusiasm and zest for life coupled with a fearless willingness to address problems made an impression on his classmate who thought of him as a “young Viking”  one with a vigorous and aggressive outlook. Both joined the Harvard program for training naval officers. Dan  taking the war-time accelerated plan  enrolled at Harvard Medical School in 1944.As a student at HMS  Dan was intrigued by salt and water homeostasis and spent a year working with Eugene Landis  Head of the Department of Physiology. This interest in ion-transport absorbed him for the rest of his life. During his residency at The Presbyterian Hospital in New York City he became curious about the properties of red-blood-cell membranes and pursued that curiosity as a post-doctoral fellow at Brookhaven  NIH  Copenhagen  and Cambridge.Dan’s first faculty appointment  in 1958  was to the Physiology Department at Washington University. Within three years  he was called to chair the Physiology and Pharmacology Department at Duke University  and later appointed a James B. Duke Distinguished Professor. While at Duke  he played an increasingly active role in the American Physiological Society  ultimately becoming its President. At the same time  he began to fervently address issues in the education of medical students  playing a major role in an imaginative curricular reform at Duke as well as actively engaging colleagues at the American Association of Medical Colleges. Addressing the Association as the Alan Gregg memorial lecturer in 1980  he said:“We are in early stages of a profound transformation of all aspects of medical education. The depth of this transformation reflects the radical changes in our views of man as organism that are arising from new discoveries in molecular and cellular biology. These changes constitute one of the great revolutions in the history of human understanding  comparable to the structure of the solar system  or of electricity  or of atoms  or of biological evolution … we are  in some ways  at dawn on the eighth day of creation”.Dan was clearly marked for high academic leadership. In 1975  he was appointed Dean of the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago. Two years later  he was called by one of us (DB) to Harvard Medical School.With an ambitious agenda for his time as Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine as well as Dean of Harvard Medical School  Dan’s first thought was to the organization of his office. He expanded the existing leadership group by creating separate offices for clinical  student  academic  and administrative affairs  recruiting senior individuals to fill those positions. He began immediately  as he did each summer  to review the situation at the School with this group and select a very short list of key priorities. He worked with them to develop a strategy for achieving each one and made sure throughout the year that he was never too diverted from his priorities by the endless duties and crises  great and small  which crowd the calendar of every dean. Once he chose an objective  he was tireless in pursuing it. When one goal was reached  he would turn his attention to the next. In any single year  the number of priorities may have seemed small. Over the entire span of his deanship  however  he was able to accomplish much more than he could possibly have done had he attempted to deal with every issue at once. The result was a record of accomplishment that is remarkable by any measure.His approach to reform of medical education is an example. He appreciated that the explosion in molecular biology and rapid advances in medical technology meant that the canon of medical knowledge would continually be modified in every medical student’s professional lifetime and preparation for rapid change needed to be the basis for learning the elements of biomedical and clinical science. Moreover  in addition to providing students with tools for gaining and evaluating new knowledge  medical schools needed also to be responsible for the acquisition of those skills and attitudes that all nascent physicians should share.At a summer decanal retreat in 1979  two years into his deanship  a three-part strategy was annunciated. 1) generate faculty interest; 2) plan a new curriculum; and 3) obtain faculty approval. In time  a fourth imperative became apparent: find funding for the enterprise.Generating faculty interest was approached through a series of annual workshops and symposia. The symposia brought in outside speakers who addressed various educational issues inside and out side of medicine. The workshops were wide-ranging internal dialogues among the School’s students and faculty.In 1982  Dan felt there were sufficient numbers of faculty engaged to begin a planning process. Planning groups produced a thoughtful set of attitudes and professional characteristics  skills  and knowledge on which to build a course-of-study. Other groups built on these to fill out the details of a curriculum that would incorporate case-based  small-group learningIn the winter of 1985  this new curriculum  known as the New Pathway  was approved as a demonstration project for 24 students. The number was increased to 40 in the next year and in the following year was adopted for the entire first-year class except for those in the Harvard-MIT (HST) program. At the same time  a new educational building was completed  designed to accommodate the tutorials and societies that were hallmarks of the New Pathway.Dan’s aspirations for HMS went beyond the education of medical students. An active scientist from his days as a medical student  he had forged a noteworthy career in the field of membrane transport. He brought this interest with him on returning to Harvard; his wife Magdalena was an active collaborator and maintained their laboratory on a day-to-day basis. Thus  it was natural that Dan be concerned about the School’s activities in the sciences basic to medicine  as he called them. Shortly after his arrival a new Department of Genetics was established and one of us (PL) came from NIH to lead it. (Serendipitously  the MGH shortly afterwards started an effort in molecular biology which was incorporated into the new department  now represented both at the School and in a hospital.) In time  all with the interests of strengthening and integrating core basic sciences  other new or reorganized departments emerged representing contemporary thrusts in biomedical research. For each of these  a world-wide search was conducted to find the best possible leader.With this new emphasis  it was imperative to grow and reorganize graduate study in the Division of Medical Sciences. With dedicated work from within the science faculty  new courses-of-study were fashioned for graduate students and their numbers greatly increased. The program became and remains of the greatest attraction to undergraduates from this country and abroad. This emphasis on both medical and scientific education converged in the MD-PhD program  and this activity was expanded dramatically. At the same time  physical aspects of scientific research were not neglected; laboratories were refurbished and additional space created.The social sciences basic to medicine were also not overlooked. A Department of Social Medicine under Leon Eisenberg gathered faculty members concerned with anthropology  sociology  history  ethnography  and medical economics. A Department of Health Care policy was established under one of us (BM) with a span of interests that included: health care financing; quality of  access to  and costs of care; among other areas.Dan cared deeply about each function and every constituency of the Medical School. He cared about the achievements of faculty members  enjoying their successes and working tirelessly and fulfilling gaps wherever he detected them. He cared about students  not just about their education  but about the quality of the lives they led during their years at the School. One of us (RS) recalls fondly that whenever approached by a student  most commonly during his walks through the Quadrangle  he was always ready to listen and respond to student suggestions  providing prompt follow-up as needed. He was most proud of student achievements inside and outside of academia.Dan’s accomplishments were recognized both at home and abroad: ten honorary degrees including one from Harvard; the Abraham Flexner Award for Distinguished Service to Medical Education; presidency of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; membership in the Institute of Medicine  fellowships in the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Danish Royal Society; as well as appointment to numerous advisory and visiting committees.Despite all of this  he was easily approachable and a good listener. He was passionate about medicine and science and his enthusiasm for discovery was infectious. He was a tireless advocate for HMS: he took its causes seriously and wanted his listeners to feel them also. This sincerity is what made him such an effective spokesperson and fundraiser; under his stewardship the School’s endowment burgeoned.After retiring form the deanship  Dan was able to spend more time at his retreat on the Damariscotta River. He loved sailing with family and friends on his sloop  Balena  beyond the seal-packed rocks out of East Boothbay. On such occasions  he would often  and enthusiastically  sing sea chanteys; his intimates sung one as the bell sounded and his ashes distributed in this hauntingly beautiful surround.Dan Tosteson is survived by his wife  Magdalena  a brother  Thomas  his sons Joshua and Tor  his daughters Ingrid  Zoe  Heather  and Carrie; and five grandchildren. They are joined by many others in mourning the loss of his company.Respectfully submitted Derek BokPhilip LederBarbara McNeilAlexander RichMichael RosenblattRobert SacksteinJames Adelstein  Chair
Paul C. Zamecnik,Paul Charles Zamecnik  the Collis P. Huntington Professor of Oncologic Medicine (Emeritus) died in Boston on October 27  2009 at the age of 96. During a research career that spanned over 70 years  he made a series of scientific contributions that were enormous in their totality and represented multiple fields of biochemistry and molecular biology. He identified and characterized the principal components of the complex process of protein synthesis  and pointed the way to the discovery of the genetic code. Later he discovered antisense RNAs and their therapeutic potential and produced the first evidence for the presence and potential role of microRNAs.Paul Zamecnik’s scientific curiosity was tweaked when a morbidly obese woman under his care died within a week of hospitalization. At autopsy he was struck at the excessive amount of fat in her tissue but only minimal protein. It caused him to wonder how proteins were actually synthesized. He asked a number of biochemists at what was then Western University Medical School but got only shrugs for a response. The year was 1938  and Zamecnik’s effort to answer that question proved to occupy his thinking and research for much of his scientific career.After working on toxic shock during World War II at Harvard’s Collis P. Huntington Laboratories for Cancer Research  Zamecnik established his own laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) focusing on the mechanisms of protein synthesis. Zamecnik was promptly able to show C14amino acid incorporation into protein in rat liver slices  but he realized that in order to dissect the intermediary events  he needed to develop a cell-free system. After several years of effort  this was finally achieved with the aid of his colleague  Nancy Bucher  who was working on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. With this system in hand  beginning in 1956 his laboratory generated a succession of major achievements. Together with Mahlon Hoagland and Mary Stephenson  he showed that ATP was required for protein synthesis via the formation of amino acid adenylates. In the process  they found that ribosomes were the site of protein assembly. After noting that the combination of ribosomes  amino acids and ATP was not sufficient  Zamecnik discovered that a soluble small molecular RNA was essential. It was first called soluble RNA (or sRNA) and later transfer RNA (or tRNA).The discovery of tRNA proved to be the adaptor molecule proposed by Francis Crick as to how the DNA message might be translated into the amino acid sequence. James Watson remarked at the time that if a cell-free system could be developed inE. coli the field could take off. Indeed  the Zamecnik group accomplished this challenge in short order and it attracted the prompt attention of scientists like Nierenberg  Matthaei  Khorana and Holley. The deciphering of the genetic code quickly followed. Years later Zamecnik  in somewhat lamenting tones  observed that “Our cell-free bacterial protein synthesizing system opened a floodgate of exciting research. We felt as if we were left standing on Mont Saint Michel while the incoming roared past us.”In 1978  while working on the structure of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) he showed that it was possible to create a short chain of nucleotides – a synthetic antisense chain – that would bind to the complementary nucleotide sequence of a messenger RNA strand. He was successful in using antisense oligos to block the replication  transcription and translation of RSV in chicken fibroblasts. Thus  a new chemotherapeutic concept was born  and later Zamecnik and co-workers used antisense inhibition inin vitrosystems to interfere with the growth of influenza virus  HIV f. malariaandM. tuberculosisin proof of principle experiments. The subsequent discoveries of siRNA and microRNA depend in their critical inhibiting step on Watson-Crick oligonucleotide hybridization of a single strand oligomer of ~ 22 nucleotides and in fact  in 1987 Zamecnik published the first evidence for the existence of micro RNAs. At that time he suggested presciently that they might function as metabolic regulators.Paul C. Zamecnik grew up in Cleveland. He received his bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College in 1933 and his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1936. It was during that same year that he met and married Mary Connor. He failed to get an internship in surgery at the MGH. In a quandary at what to do  he consulted Oliver Cope who suggested he talk with his brother-in-law  Joseph Aub at the Collis P. Huntington Hospital of Harvard University  since a resident there had just declined a position. During the course of a very friendly meeting  Aub asked Zamecnik if he would teach his daughters how to ski (PZ having skied at Dartmouth). Paul agreed and he became a medical resident at the Huntington Hospital even before an internship. That eventful meeting with Aub was the beginning of a lifelong and fruitful relationship between the two.In 1938  Zamecnik went to Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland for his medical internship  but soon he began to feel that clinical medicine offered little that one could do for patients. Given his recently developed interest in protein synthesis  he was advised to try and land a position with the renowned Max Bergmann at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. After being told by Bergmann that he wanted “a chemist  not a medical man ” Zamecnik obtained a fellowship to work with Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen  Denmark. The Nazi invasion of Denmark cut short his stay. On returning home Bergmann accepted him in his lab.Bergmann believed that protein synthesis was the reverse of proteolysis  but Zamecnik had his doubts. In the mid 1940s  Fritz Lipmann came to the MGH from Denmark and at lunch with Zamecnik one day  he said  “You don’t really think these Bergmann enzymes have anything to do with protein synthesis  do you?” Lipmann thought there was a whole new pathway in which amino acids were energized. That led to Zamecnik’s quest to find out whether Bergmann or Lipmann was right. It was obviously Lipmann.In 1956  Zamecnik became the Collis P. Huntington Professor of Oncologic Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He continued his research at MGH until 1979 when he reached mandatory retirement. He then moved his laboratory to the Worcester Foundation for Medical Research in Massachusetts  and in 1997 he returned to MGH as a senior scientist affiliated with its Cancer Center. He continued to be remarkably productive showing that the insertion of oligonucleotides by transhybridization could correct the cystic fibrosis gene mutation and that antisense oligos could inhibitM. tuberculosiscell wall synthesis. He was at work on these and other projects until four weeks before his death.Throughout his research career  Zamecnik was scrupulous in the execution of his experiments. He insisted that every detail be meticulously recorded so that if any questions arose about the results  the experiments could be replicated to the last detail. He demanded this of himself and his co-workers.In addition to his own laboratory effort  he played a primary role in the development of the overall research enterprise at the MGH. Not only did he and his colleagues pursue fundamental biology in a hospital setting  but they also welcomed interested people from the clinical departments to work in their midst. Along with the efforts of Joseph Aub and Fritz Lipmann  the scene was set for the increasingly diverse and remarkable research effort in which fundamental biological themes occupied a prized and important place in the institution. Zamecnik’s concern for younger colleagues endeared him to them and added to their motivation to pursue careers in science as it relates to chemical medicine.Paul Zamecnik loved science and the excitement of discovery. Spending time in his laboratory engaged in research provided him tremendous joy. He often expressed amazement that he was actually being paid for activities and an environment that provided him remarkable enjoyment.Zamecnik received many prestigious awards in his lifetime including the National Medal of Science in 1991 and in 1996 the Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science in 1996. In making the presentation  the Lasker Jury noted that “Zamecnik’s identification of transfer RNA is a landmark in the history of science. In this one experiment biochemistry and genetics became fused into the new science of molecular biology and the door was opened for creating the genetic code.”Paul Zamecnik was uniformly admired by his peers and colleagues for his integrity  generosity  originality  and wisdom. He was very reserved and modest and he viewed his accomplishments with a quiet and dignified humility.Paul’s wife Mary died in 2005. Their married life together spanned 69 years. They are survived by three children  seven grand children and two great granddaughters.Respectfully submitted Kurt J. Isselbacher  chairpersonRobert LoftfieldArthur B. PardeePaul S. Russell
Andrew Mattei Gleason,“Have you ever thought of this?” is how Andrew Gleason often preceded the formulation of some idea  or some question  to his mathematical colleagues and students. Usually we had not (thought of the idea) and even if we had  we would not have expressed it in as clarifying  or as enticing  a manner as he did. The “this” could range quite broadly: ideas related to transformation groups and his famous solution to Hilbert’s Fifth Problem   to measure theory  projective geometry  Hilbert Spaces  or to combinatorics  to graph theory  to coding theory  or—and this was also one of Gleason’s many great loves—to the teaching and perfection of mathematical skills at any level (how to treatmeasuringwhen teaching first-graders; reforming the teaching of Calculus; and savoring the latest Putnam Competition exam questions). Quite a span.Andrew Gleason’s own early education had a significant geographical span. He graduated from high school in Yonkers  New York  having also taken courses in Berkeley  California. His undergraduate years at Yale were spent largely taking graduate level courses. When Andy graduated in 1942  he joined the U.S. Navy as a member of a group of 8–10 mathematicians working to crack enemy codes.In 1946 Gleason came to Harvard  having been elected as a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows. To be such a Fellow in those days meant that one could achieve an academic career without having a PhD.  Andy never did pursue a doctoral degree; he spent his time in the Society of Fellows developing a broad mathematical culture and thinking about Hilbert’s Fifth Problem.At the end of his three-year fellowship  Gleason was appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics in the Harvard Department of Mathematics. Soon thereafter  he took a two-year leave of absence from Harvard to return to the U.S. Navy to serve during the Korean War (mid-1950 to mid-1953). After this  Gleason returned to Harvard where he spent the rest of his academic career. He was appointed Professor of Mathematics in 1957.Gleason married Jean Berko in 1959.  Jean Berko Gleason  a prominent psycholinguist  has had a distinguished academic career as Professor in the Department of Psychology at Boston University. The Gleasons have three daughters: Katherine  Pamela  and Cynthia.Gleason was named the Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy in 1969 (the oldest endowed chair in the sciences in the United States).  He became a Senior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows in 1977 and was Chair of the Society of Fellows from 1989 to 1996. Gleason retired from Harvard University in 1992.His mathematical conversations  his seminar discussions  his writing  and his lectures had qualities most cherished in a mathematician:  he was comprehensible  clear and to the point; his formulations had a scintillating precision  and they were always delivered with enthusiasm and wide-eyed wonder. One of his colleagues once summed up this saying: “When he touched a thing  he made it shine.”Our late colleague Raoul Bott once joked that Andy lacked the essential Hungarian talent for being absent when an important administrative task needed to be done.  One of us recounted this in a talk at Andy’s memorial service  adding:Andy served Harvard  his department  the Society of Fellows  and the mathematical profession with generosity and skill. Although he held strong opinions  he never imposed them on others  and never made anyone feel small if they didn’t possess his brilliance. In fact  I never heard Andy raise his voice  either in conversation or in a meeting. That’s not to say he wasn’t convincing—it was his vision of a small faculty  training the best graduate students and amplified by the energy of outstanding undergraduates  that defines the mathematics department we have at Harvard today.Gleason’s best known work is his resolution of Hilbert’s Fifth Problem. David Hilbert  slightly over a century ago  formulated two dozen problems that have  since then  represented celebrated milestones measuring mathematical progress. Many of the advances in Hilbert’s problems initiate whole new fields  new viewpoints. Those few mathematicians who have resolved one of these problems have been referred to as members of theHonors Class.Hilbert fashioned his  “Fifth Problem” as a way of offering a general commodious context for the then new theory of Sophus Lie regarding transformation groups. Nowadays  Lie’s theory is the mainstay of much mathematics and physics  and his kind of groups  “Lie groups ” constitute an important feature of our basic scientific landscape.One can think of a transformation group as a collection of symmetries of a geometric space.  Some spaces admit infinitely many symmetries: think of the circle which can be rotated at any angle.  The grand problem facing Sophus Lie is how to deal with these infinite groups of symmetries.Can one use the methods of Calculus effectively to treat the issues that arise in connection with these infinite transformation groups?At the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge in 1950  Andy proposed a possible method to arrive at an (affirmative!) answer to this question  in the context proposed by Hilbert.   Andy emphasized the central role played by the one-parameter subgroups in the picture. The following year he proved a key result about maximal connected compact subgroups  and the year after that  using results of Montgomery & Zippin  and Yamabe  Andy clinched things  and showed that the answer to Hilbert’s question answer is “yes.” An extremely important advance.The depth of Andy’s work is extraordinary  as is its breadth: from his computer explorations very early in the history of machine computation (a search problem in the n-cube) to solving a conjecture of our late colleague George Mackey (about measures on the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space) to the intricacies of finite projective geometry and coding theory  to the relationship between complex analytic geometry and Banach algebras. Gleason was also one of the rare breed of mathematicians who did not stay on just one side of the Pure mathematics/ Applied mathematics “divide.” In fact  his work and attitude gave testimony to the tenet that thereisno essential divide.Indeed  the ideas and mathematical interests that Andy nurtured in his applied work for the government which was a passion for him throughout his lifetime  connects well with his public work on finite geometries  and his love for combinatorics.Andy’s interest in the training of mathematicians and in exposition and teaching in general  led him to edit  with co-authors  a compendium of three decades of William Lowell Putnam mathematical competition problems  to write a bold text formulating the foundations of analysis starting with a grand and lucid tour of logic and set theory  and also to engage in the important project of K-12 mathematical education  and to reform efforts in the teaching of Calculus.The founding idea behind the various mathematical education initiatives with which Andy was involved—either the programs for early mathematical education that were referred to (by both detractors and promoters) asNew Math  or the programs for teaching Calculus (providing syllabi and texts that came to be referred to as the Harvard Consortium)—was to present mathematics concretely and intuitively  and to energize and empower the students and teachers. The essential mission of the Calculus Consortium was and is Andy’s credo that the ideas should be based in equal parts of geometry for visualization of the concepts  computation to ground it in the real world  and algebraic manipulation for power.This relates to Andy’s general view: that a working mathematician should have at his or her disposal a toolkit of basic techniques for analyzing any problem. He felt that all good problems in math—at any level—should weave together algebra  geometry  and analysis  and students must learn to draw on any of these tools  having them all “at the ready.” Andy emphasized this in the Mathematics Department’s discussion regarding the structure of the department’s comprehensive qualifying exam for graduate students. He also loved to think about exam problems that exhibited this unifying call upon different techniques; for example  he would work out the problems of the (undergraduate) Putnam Competition exam  year after year  just for fun.Andy had many honors. He received the Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his work on Hilbert’s Fifth Problem. He received the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics—the Mathematical Association of America’s most prestigious award. He was president of the American Mathematical Society (1981–1982)  a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Philosophical Society.Respectfully submitted Benedict GrossDavid Mumford (Brown University)Barry Mazur  Chair
Memorial service for Leon Kirchner,A memorial gathering in remembrance of Leon Kirchner  the Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music Emeritus  will be held on Apr. 8 (7:30-9:30 p.m.) at John Knowles Paine Concert Hall.The service will be sponsored by the Harvard Department of Music.

Finance expert Gordon Donaldson dies at 87,Gordon Donaldson  an influential Harvard Business School (HBS) professor  mentor  researcher  and administrator from 1955 to 1993  died on Feb. 12 in Parkland  Fla.  at the age of 87. An expert in corporate financial management  Donaldson was the Willard Prescott Smith Professor of Corporate FinanceEmeritusat HBS.Born on July 1  1922  in Winnipeg  Manitoba and a graduate of the University of Manitoba at the age of 19  he earned a master’s degree in economics from the University of Toronto. In the midst of World War II  he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force  serving as an instructor to flight crews from England  Australia  and New Zealand. At the end of the war  he decided to come to the United States to resume his studies.Donaldson took courses at Harvard Business School in 1950-51 before returning to his native Manitoba to teach and work on his doctoral dissertation. He was invited to join the HBS faculty in 1955  even before completing his doctorate in commercial science in 1956.Donaldson’s pedagogical reach extended across Harvard Business School’s M.B.A.  doctoral  and executive education programs  and his involvement in executive education included two stints in the School’s middle management programs  a year as head of a program for senior managers that then took place in Switzerland  and a six-year assignment in the Owner/President Management Program for entrepreneurs that ended upon his retirement in 1993.“Gordon Donaldson was a great clinical researcher and a wise mentor to many young faculty members attempting to navigate their way through the promotions process at HBS  a process he led for many years ” said Baker Foundation Professor William E. Fruhan Jr. “He possessed remarkably good judgment and always had a balanced point of view. Over the years  his advice was sought out by successive deans on matters of great importance to the School. He was a pillar of the institution.”Donaldson is survived by two daughters  Mary Louise Meier of Parkland  Fla.  and Patricia Donaldson Smith of Bolton  Mass.; two sons  Richard E. Donaldson of Gorham  Maine  and Robert G. Donaldson of Brunswick  Maine; and six grandchildren. In addition to his wife  a brother  Desmond  also predeceased him.In lieu of flowers  the family has requested that friends and colleagues consider a donation to organizations that were of special interest to Donaldson  such as the Salvation Army  the Humane Society  or any conservation group. A memorial service celebrating his life may be scheduled in the spring.To read Donaldson’s full obituary  visit theHarvard Business School Web site.
Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls,Daniel H.H. Ingalls  Wales Professor of Sanskrit Emeritus  was born in New York City on May 4  1916. He attended Harvard College  and studied the Classics  including his first courses in Sanskrit with Walter E. Clark. While Ingalls’ father apparently expected Harvard to prepare his son to join the management of The Homestead in Hot Springs  Virginia  Daniel Ingalls’ years at Harvard gradually turned him to the lifelong study of Sanskrit philosophy and poetry. He graduated in 1936 with an A.B.cum laudein Classics. He thereupon enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School to study Sanskrit  Chinese  and Japanese  earned an A.M. in 1938  and was elected to a Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows (1939–42)  where he continued his study of Sanskrit.In 1941 he persuaded the Senior Fellows to send him to India  where he worked on Indian logic with M.M. Sri Kalipada Tarkacharya at the Sanskrit Research Institute in Calcutta. After Pearl Harbor he returned and entered the O.S.S. In 1942 he and his colleague Richard Frye traveled as civilians to Afghanistan  where his job in Kabul was to watch for contacts by Indians (then British subjects) with Axis agents. As cover he taught English at the Habibi Lycee and worked on his doctoral dissertation. The completed draft of the dissertation was sent home by diplomatic pouch  but was lost. After the war he rewrote it as his first book. He returned home in 1943  was commissioned in the Army  and spent the remainder of the war working on Japanese code-breaking in Military Intelligence near Washington.After the war he was elected to a second term in the Society of Fellows (1946–49). Since Junior Fellows are permitted to do some teaching  he helped out with Sanskrit courses after the retirement of Walter E. Clark  his predecessor as Wales Professor  and in 1949 became an assistant professor  in 1954 associate professor  and in 1958 Wales Professor of Sanskrit  continuing in that post until his retirement in 1983.While Ingalls was a dedicated teacher and scholar  he was not an empire builder. He remarked in a note to the president  “The less administration I have  the happier man I shall be.” During his tenure  the study of India was largely defined by classical studies. In 1951  however  he instigated a change in the name of the Department from Indic Philology to the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies. By the late 1950s  it came to include Indian and Tibetan Buddhism  and by the time of his retirement in 1981  it included positions in Hindu Studies and Indo-Muslim Studies as well.During the golden period of rapid expansion in Asian studies  some 50 of his students finished with a Ph.D. and began teaching at major universities throughout the world. Through the students he trained  Ingalls had an enormous influence on the development of Sanskrit studies in North America. Among both his students and collaborators were Indian scholars as well. Though a political conservative himself  Ingalls had a lifelong friendship with the Indian Marxist historian D.D. Kosambi  who became the text-editor for theSubhasitaratnakosa. Of Kosambi  Ingalls wrote  “I have never met a man with whom I disagreed on such basic questions  yet whose company I so constantly enjoyed.”Throughout most of his career at Harvard  Dan Ingalls constituted a one-man department  teaching at all levels from beginning Sanskrit to advanced courses in Indian philosophy and poetry. The Sanskrit Library in Widener became the center of energetic and demanding study for generations of Sanskrit students. He also met students by appointment in his Widener study where he had no telephone  but could be found by those with the temerity to knock on his door. This was open for business and visitors once per week from 8-9 a.m.  had no phone but a typewriter built in 1888.He had the reputation for being a demanding teacher  to be sure. It is said that his description of the department for the undergraduate manual Fields of Concentration  began  “Sanskrit is a difficult language. Only the rare undergraduate would be advised to take it.” But as one former student remembers  “Studying with Daniel Ingalls was exhausting  demanding  and rewarding.” He taught with patience and authority  bringing out the beauty of the classical Sanskrit texts that he loved and communicating this to his students. Ingalls taught not only Sanskrit but also Harvard’s first General Education course on Indian Civilization.In 1950  Ingalls published his first bookMaterials for the Study of Navya-Nyaya Logic(Harvard Oriental Series Volume 40) based on his intended Ph.D. work. It is an introduction of the “new” school of Indian logic  bringing to light its analytic and intellectual achievements. Here Ingalls “sought to demonstrate that Indian philosophy not only can be as careful and precise as Western analytic philosophy but in fact may well have something of vital importance to teach it” (S. Pollock). In the West  this launched an entirely new field of studies.While Ingalls continued to write on Indian philosophy  his deep interest in poetry came increasingly to the fore. In 1964  he published a 460 page volumeAn Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry. Vidyakara’s Subhasitaratnakosa.(H.O.S. Volume 44)  containing some 1 700 Sanskrit verses collected by a Buddhist monk around 1050 C.E. Ingalls’ great intuition for Sanskrit along with his magisterial command of English made this translation among the very best. It is still available in a paperback edition. His introductions  notes  and commentaries make the entire work a masterful and enduring contribution to Sanskrit literary studies. In the introduction  Ingalls sheds light on the development of Indian poetry and compares the impersonality of Sanskrit poetry with the predominantly personal poetry of the West. As the project came to a conclusion  Ingalls said that Vidyakara had furnished him with “the happiest hours of labor that I have yet known.”In 1981 the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies joined the Center for the Study of World Religions in hosting a dinner for Ingalls to celebrate the recent publication of a Festschrift dedicated to him as “one of the great humanistic scholars of our time” and entitledSanskrit and Indian Studies: Essays in Honour of Daniel H. H. Ingalls. Its preface emphasized his immense breadth of scholarship and the pioneering impact and lasting value of his two books  one for the study of logic and the other for literary studies. A flood of telegrams and letters of appreciation arrived from India  England  Japan  and many parts of the United States.In 1990  after his retirement  Daniel Ingalls brought to conclusion his third major contribution to the Harvard Oriental Series  a joint undertaking with Jeffrey M. Masson and M.V. Patwardhan The Dhvanyaloka of Anandavardhana with the Locana of Abhinavagupta edited with an introduction by Ingalls himself (H.O.S. Volume 49). The book deals with the culmination of Indian poetics by the Kashmiri scholar Abhinavagupta in the 9th century C.E. In this  he makes one of the most influential texts and commentaries of Sanskrit aesthetics and literary theory available in English.In addition to his three major books  he published some twenty-seven articles on Indological topics. After his retirement  Ingalls worked with his son  computer scientist Daniel H. H. Ingalls Jr.  Harvard ‘66  on a computer-assisted analysis of the literary technique of the Mahabharata  and their first findings were published in 1985 in theJournal of South Asian Literature.During these years  Ingalls was the editor of the Harvard Oriental Series (H.O.S. Volumes 42–48) and brought out the long-neglected German translation of India’s oldest text  the Rgveda  by K.F. Geldner (H.O.S. Volumes 33–36  1951–57). He also served for forty-three years as a trustee of the Harvard Yenching Institute  which has since established a fellowship in his honor. He was President of the American Oriental Society in 1959-60 and Director of the Association of Asian Studies in 1959.His entrenched patrician and conservative views  reinforced by his background in the railroad and hotel business  became obvious  in 1969 at the time of the occupation of University Hall. At a  faculty meeting with radicals in the majority  he tried  urged on by conservative colleagues   to make a motionin supportof the administration; it  never occurred to him that this could be voted down.Dan Ingalls was a cultured  polite  elegant host to friends  neighbors  and students. He was in close contact with colleagues in classical studies. In addition to the Society of Fellows  he was a member of the History of Religions and Philology Clubs that met for dinner and talks at members’ homes. He kept in contact with students and colleagues even after his retirement to Virginia and he would gather some twenty-five students for a Sanskrit readingsalonin his apartment on Memorial Drive.Even while he was a professor at Harvard  Ingalls was a member of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce. From 1963 onwards  he was chairman of the Virginia Hot Springs Corporation  Inc.  an enterprise that included the Homestead resort  where he usually spent his summers. Indeed  as he wrote in 1986  he “led a schizophrenic life ” split between his family’s business interests in Virginia and his scholarly pursuits at Cambridge. After retirement he moved back to his home  called The Yard  in Hot Springs  and took up the full time management of the family business.Ingalls married Phyllis Sarah Day in 1936  the same year he graduated from Harvard. Over the years  they made their home at 24 Coolidge Hill  Cambridge. They had three children—Sarah Day  Rachel Holmes (Radcliffe ‘64)  and Daniel Henry Holmes Jr. (Harvard ’66).

‘Love Story’ author Erich Segal  72,Erich Segal  the author of the Harvard-based novel “Love Story” and who once taught classics at the University  died of a heart attack on Jan. 17. He was 72.Segal taught at Harvard in the early 1960s after earning three degrees from the University. Once a Dunster House resident  he received an A.B. in 1958  graduated as the class poet and Latin salutatorian  and participated in that year’s Hasty Pudding show. He received an A.M. in classics in 1959  and a Ph.D. in comparative literature in 1965. He also taught at institutions such as Yale University  Princeton University  the University of Munich  and Wolfson College in Oxford  England.Segal was most renowned for his novel “Love Story ” which was based on a screenplay he had penned. The book was an overnight success  selling more than 21 million copies in 33 languages. It later became a film starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O’Neal  and was the highest-grossing movie of 1971. “Love Story” remains a staple for incoming Harvard freshmen  who watch it each fall.His other novels include “The Class ” “Doctors ” “Acts of Faith ” and “Prizes.” Alongside the Beatles and other writers  Segal helped to pen the screenplay for 1968’s film “Yellow Submarine.”Segal also was a long-distance runner  completing more than 40 marathons. At the time of his death  Segal had been suffering from Parkinson’s disease for nearly 25 years.A private funeral was held in London. He is survived by his wife  Karen James  and daughters Francesca  29  and Miranda  20.
Ihor Ševčenko,Ihor Ševčenko  the eminent Byzantinist and Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Byzantine History and Literature Emeritus  died peacefully at his Cambridge home on Dec. 26 after eight months of failing health  just short of his 88th birthday.At Harvard he was a member of the Department of the Classics from 1973 to 1992  and associate director of the Ukrainian Research Institute from 1973 to 1989. A master of many Slavic and Western languages in their ancient  medieval  and modern forms  Ševčenko was known as a brilliant researcher in history  philology  and literature. Over a distinguished academic career  he held teaching or research appointments at 15 institutions  ranging from the University of California  Berkeley  to the University of Michigan in the United States  and from the Central European University of Budapest to the University of Oxford in Europe.Ševčenko was born of Ukrainian parents in early 1922 in Radość  a village in east-central Poland  not far from Warsaw. His father and mother  Ivan Ivanović and Maria Czerniatyńska Ševčenko  before emigrating to Warsaw  had been active in the Ukrainian national movement  and Ivan had been a department head in the Interior Ministry. In the Polish capital  the young Ševčenko attended the Adam Mickiewicz Gymnasium and Lycaeum  where he studied classical languages and probably others. Already as a teenager he had translated into Polish an extract from one of Voltaire’s works for a student journal.His first university studies were at the Deutsche Karlsuniversität in Prague  where he mastered Czech and German  and in 1945 he was granted a doctorate of philosophy in classical philology  ancient history  and comparative linguistics. During this period  he published a translation of George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” into Ukrainian. For that translation  intended for ordinary Ukrainians  including literate peasants  living in the camps for displaced persons in Germany following World War II  he was able to persuade Orwell to contribute an account of his own personal history and the backdrop to the dystopian novel.Ševčenko then migrated to Belgium  where he spent four years at the Université Catholique de Louvain  studying classical philology and Byzantinology. He received a degree as “docteur en philosophie et lettres” in 1949. He also participated in the seminar in Byzantine history presided over by Henri Grégoire in Brussels. Grégoire  the prodigiously productive and charismatic leader of Byzantine studies in Belgium  was to have a lasting impact on Ševčenko the scholar. Years later  he recalled that Grégoire’s seminars remained for him “among the most exciting of my intellectual experiences.” He also felt an undying gratitude toward the older man for having extended a hospitable hand in a time of need  to himself and others — “the homeless flotsam ” in Ševčenko’s words  left adrift in the aftermath of World War II.Ševčenko moved to the United States at the beginning of the 1950s as the result of an invitation from the famous medievalist Ernst Kantorowicz  and was given his first academic employment by the University of California  Berkeley  lecturing on ancient and Byzantine history. There  he met his first wife  Margaret Bentley. Following two years of fellowship and research in Washington  D.C.  and Cambridge  Mass.  he became an instructor in Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Michigan. The appointment soon turned into a professorial position from 1954 to ’57  for which his teaching duties included Slavic languages  old Russian literature  and Byzantine history. His next post was at Columbia University where  as an associate and then a full professor  he taught a spectrum of Byzantine and Slavic studies. Some of his first doctoral students came out of the Columbia years  1957 to ’65.After a stint in 1960 as visiting scholar at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington  D.C.  the mecca for Byzantine studies in North America  he began a close association with the Harvard institution that was to last the rest of his life. In 1965 he was invited to join the resident senior scholars there  and he spent the next eight years in the idyllic Georgetown setting  with a glorious library at his fingertips  and surrounded each year by different coteries of researchers on fellowships  as well as by a succession of the most distinguished Byzantinists visiting from Europe. His stay there overlapped for a number of years with the residency of Cyril Mango  another giant of Byzantinology. Here the two friends presided over the center’s intellectual life  sometimes daunting but generally dazzling the junior fellows in particular. On the down-to-earth side  Ševčenko and his second wife  the art historian Nancy Patterson Ševčenko  provided the relaxing highlight of each week by hosting on Wednesday evenings an open house party for the Dumbarton Oaks community.In 1973  Ševčenko made his last major academic move  from Washington to Cambridge  to become the Dumbarton Oaks Professor of Byzantine History and Literature at Harvard  as a member of the Department of the Classics. He taught medieval Greek courses  offered seminars on Byzantine literature and paleography  and trained graduate students. He was co-editor of “Harvard Ukrainian Studies ” which he helped to found. And he was an active member of the Ukrainian Research Institute  which he helped to establish in 1973  until his retirement in 1992.As a scholar  Ševčenko shared an unusual number of similarities — some hardly accidental — with his intellectual mentor  Grégoire: expertise in a remarkable range of Western and Slavic languages; a scholar’s basis in classical philology; student wanderings to several countries; exploratory travels for manuscripts in libraries and inscriptions on site; and a gift for astute  off-the-cuff ideas and conjectures.Mango  one of the most astute readers of Ševčenko  in his comparison of Grégoire and Ševčenko included “a multiplicity of enthusiasms that have prevented both men from writing big books.” On the occasion of the 1984 Festschrift for his one-time colleague at Dumbarton Oaks  Mango expressed the wish for “a book on Byzantium and the Slavs  and perhaps another on Byzantine hagiography  or a least a long and thoughtful article on each.” Over the course of Ševčenko’s career  no book-length narratives were produced  but in rich compensation there were large collected volumes containing a wealth of important articles  some long  all thoughtful  and each an eye-opener for the thoroughness of the scholarship and the vividness of its presentation.For extensive studies there was  at the beginning  the doctoral monograph on two 14th century statesmen and literati  Theodore Metochites and Nikephoros Choumnos  finally published in 1962; and at the end  almost ready for the printer after more than 20 years of careful preparation  there was a critical edition and translation of a seminal biography composed in the 10th century  “The Life of Emperor Basil I.” Among the articles and essays were many standouts. For instance  there was the enlightening and entertaining essay on “Two Varieties of Historical Writing” in which a magisterial Ševčenko compared the “vivid” and the “technical” historian  or  using his more colorful terms  the “butterfly” and the “caterpillar.” There was the widely read and appreciated “The Decline of Byzantium Seen Through the Eyes of Its Intellectuals ” in the Dumbarton Oaks Papers of 1961. In the same journal in 1971  there was the stunning piece of detective work  “The Date and Author of the So-Called Fragments of Toparcha Gothicus ” in which he surgically unmasked scholarly fraud perpetrated by a 19th century Hellenist and paleographer  the Franco-German Karl Benedikt Hase. There is an impressive 1995 overview of studies in one of his favorite genres  biographies of saints  titled “Observations on the Study of Byzantine Hagiography in the Last Half-Century  or Two Looks Back and One Look Forward.” His collected Byzantine papers were issued in two volumes  while his contributions over a lifetime to Byzantino-Slavic and Ukrainian cultural and historical matters were likewise published in two volumes.Ševčenko was president of the Association Internationale des Études Byzantines from 1986 to ’96  and the breadth of his scholarship and accomplishments received further recognition in multiple honorary doctorates  as well as membership in numerous learned societies. Research and literary prizes came his way from Germany (the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung) and Ukraine (L’viv and Kyiv). The title of the first of two Festschriften produced in his honor  “Okeanos” (1984)  captured the vastness of his learning. (Appropriately  it borrowed the sobriquet of a very large manuscript  called “The Ocean ” in a monastery on Mt. Athos containing an encyclopedic collection of texts dealing with the sciences  literature  philosophy  and theology.) In his written self-presentation  he liked to end the long list of his achievements and honors with the modest notice  at once heartfelt and humorous  “His hobby is trout fishing.” In the epitaph  which he composed in Latin a few years ago  he said of himself: “Over a long life he witnessed very many deaths; his own  therefore  he did not fear.”He is survived by his two daughters  Catherine and Elisabeth; three grandchildren; former wives Oksana Draj-Xmara Asher and Nancy Patterson Ševčenko; and numerous students  colleagues  and friends.Interment took place during a private service at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Plans are pending for a public memorial service to be held at Harvard in early February. In lieu of flowers  donations are being accepted to establish an endowment in his name to award travel grants to students in Byzantine and premodern Slavic studies.

Anthropologist Hymes dies at 82,Dell H. Hymes  82  an influential linguistic anthropologist and folklorist who taught at Harvard from 1955 to 1960  died in Charlottesville  Va.  on Nov. 13. Retiring from teaching in 2000 as the Commonwealth Professor of Anthropology and EnglishEmeritusat the University of Virginia  Hymes will be remembered for his widespread advancement of the field of sociolinguistics.A memorial gathering was held at the American Anthropological Association’s national meeting Dec. 5 in Philadelphia.
Alastair Graham Walter Cameron,Alastair Graham Walter Cameron was born in Winnipeg on June 21  1925  and died in Tucson on October 3  2005. As a boy his interests ran to science fiction and away from sports. His father was head of the biochemistry department at the Manitoba Medical College; at the age of four Cameron addressed all men as “Doctor ” which he later said was an early example of forming a hypothesis based on limited data.His mother raised him by herself. Working his way through a private high school he became a bookie  taking bets from fellow students  and did quite well. In about 1941 he made a bet with a classmate that man would land on the Moon by the year 1970. Years later the classmate asked Cameron how he had known when the Apollo Program would take place. He replied that he had extrapolated the speed of transportation to the time when that speed would exceed that needed to escape from the Earth.He majored in math and physics at the University of Manitoba  and for his physics Ph.D. at the University of Saskatchewan  where he devised a new method to determine nuclear cross sections. He went on to apply nuclear physics to the origin of the chemical elements  or nucleosynthesis  in stars. In 1955 he married Elizabeth “Betsy” MacMillan. Betsy called Cameron “Alastair ” but in the scientific community he was known only as “Al.”After the Ph.D.  Cameron spent two years at the Ames Research Center of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While there he read that the astronomer Paul Merrill had observed a feature in the spectrum of a red giant star that corresponds to the chemical element technetium (Tc). Technetium has no stable isotopes; it was discovered in 1937 only after bombarding molybdenum with energetic particles; hence its name  derived from the Greek for “artificial.” Given the fact that technetium decays rapidly into other elements  Cameron reasoned that it must have been created in the star where Merrill found it. Cameron found this discovery “very exciting” because it provides a clue to the origin of the heavy elements in the Universe. Having never studied astrophysics before  Cameron immersed himself in the literature. In 1954 he relocated to the Chalk River Laboratory of the Canadian Atomic Energy Project  where he calculated cross sections for the many nuclear reactions that occur in the interiors of stars when the temperature is high enough for collisions between charged nuclei to overcome the electrical repulsion between them.The temperature at the center of the Sun is 14 million degrees  high enough to allow the conversion of hydrogen into helium  but not high enough for the reactions that ultimately lead to the creation of elements as heavy as Tc  that require hundreds of millions of degrees.While Cameron was working on nucleosynthesis  other theorists calculated that the Sun would run out of hydrogen in 5 billion years  at which time the temperature in its core would begin to rise  and the Sun would become a red giant star of the type that Merrill observed to contain Tc. Surprisingly  when stars run out of one nuclear fuel  their cores get hotter  not cooler  and then new fuels that react only at higher temperatures kick in. In red giant stars the helium produced earlier is reacting to form even heavier elements.Cameron predicted what elements are produced and in what quantities. He found that indeed technetium is produced along the way  explaining Merrill’s observation. In order to be found in the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars  and in solid bodies such as planets and meteorites  new elements have to first be ejected from the parent star into space where they contaminate interstellar matter destined to form new generations of stars and planets. Thus the full understanding of nucleosynthesis involves the formation of stars and planets  as well as the ejection of heavy elements into space by red-giant winds and supernova explosions. Undaunted by the challenge  Cameron plunged into a full range of theoretical astrophysics.Cameron published his papers on nucleosynthesis in 1957. Experts attribute the birth of the field of nuclear astrophysics to those papers  together with one by a group at Caltech led by William Fowler published the same year. Fowler  an experimentalist  won the Nobel Prize in 1983 for his work in the field  and in his Nobel Lecture credited the independent work of Cameron.In 1961 Cameron moved from Chalk River to the newly formed Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. There he supervised graduate students at Columbia  New York University  and Yale. He taught regularly at Yale  where his students compiled his notes into a monograph that is highly regarded  but unfortunately  was never published. In 1973  upon the founding of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at 60 Garden Street  Cameron was appointed to a professorship in the Department of Astronomy at Harvard. He also accepted a position as associate director of CfA for Planetary Science  a field to which his interests were increasingly turning because of the continuing discoveries of anomalous abundances of isotopes in meteorites. His model of the Solar Nebula  a disk of gas and dust formed at the time of the origin of the Sun 4.5 billion years ago  provides quantitative temperatures that theorists use in their studies of planet formation.During this period  Cameron is reported to have given a seminar at Caltech covering the entire history of the Sun and planets  from the collapse of an interstellar cloud to the coagulation of dust to form the solid cores of the planets. When asked what he did on the seventh day  Cameron replied  “I rested.”An important result of Cameron’s work was his conclusion that the main product of the buildup of the observed high abundance of the elements near iron in the periodic table is not iron per se  as had been assumed  but radioactive nickel 56. His idea was verified many years later by a NASA spacecraft.In 1982 Cameron became the chair of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences  which advises NASA on its science program  and at Harvard he served six years as chair of the Department of Astronomy. During this period he also organized annual conferences to bring together astrophysicists and planetary scientists to enhance collaborations between their different specialties.He then decided to attack a long-standing theoretical problem in planetary physics: the origin of the Moon. The Apollo Program had found that unlike the Earth  the Moon has no iron core  but is composed solely of the same material as the mantle of the Earth. At the time theorists could not explain this fact. Cameron proposed that the Moon formed from a disk of debris orbiting the Earth  much as the Solar Nebula orbited the Sun. But where could the debris have come from? Cameron proposed that it was material ejected from Earth’s mantle when a Mars-sized body collided with the Earth early in the history of the solar system. That would explain the Moon’s composition  but how would the debris reach the distance of the Moon? Cameron attacked this problem head on  acquiring faster computers for his office in order to model the collision event. He finally succeeded in showing that such a collision would result in a disk of the correct mass  as well as the angular momenta of the Earth and Moon that are observed today. Cameron’s theory is now the accepted one for the origin of the Moon.Cameron received honors from many scientific societies  among them the Petrie Prize of the Canadian Astronomical Society  the NASA Distinguished Service Medal  the Smith Medal of the National Academy of Sciences  the Hess Medal of the American Geophysical Union  the Leonard Medal of the Meteoritical Society  the Bethe Prize of the American Physical Society  and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society—the highest honor an astronomer can receive.Upon his retirement from Harvard in 1999  Cameron accepted an appointment at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson. There he and Betsy lived in the Academy Village  a non-profit organization devoted to life-long learning. Sadly  Betsy  his loving wife of forty-six years  died in 2001; they had no children. Those of us who were lucky enough to know Al Cameron well remember him as an exceptionally talented and dedicated scientist  a wise counselor  and a witty person. Few are those who cross one’s path with all of these qualities; Al Cameron was one of them.Respectfully submitted Alexander DalgarnoJames MoranDimitar SasselovPatrick ThaddeusFriedrich ThielemannGerald WasserburgJohn WoodGeorge Field  Chair

Robert David Utiger,Robert D. “Bob” Utiger  M.D.  a beloved physician  researcher  mentor  educator  and editor died on June 29  2008 at his home in Weston  Massachusetts. Bob was born on July 14  1931 in Bridgeport  Connecticut  but  when he was young  the family moved to St. Louis where he grew up and attended a local private school for the first two years of his high school education. He subsequently transferred for his last two years to Phillips Exeter Academy and later entered Williams College. There he was a scholar-athlete  playing four years of varsity lacrosse and graduatingPhi Beta Kappa.It was during a summer vacation after his junior year that Bob took a trip to Europe on a refurbished Liberty ship and among the passengers was a young woman attending Middlebury College named Sally Baldwin. A casual relationship was established which flourished during the next year  with a number of trips between Middlebury and Williamstown. Bob then entered medical school at Washington University in St. Louis and he and Sally were married in 1953 in Newtonville  Massachusetts. Their three children  Jane Lyon Utiger  David Frey Utiger  and Nancy Baldwin Murphy were all born and grew up in St. Louis.Bob was an outstanding medical student. GraduatingAlpha Omega Alpha  he received his house staff training and became a Chief Resident in Medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. He served a fellowship with William Daughaday  a world-class researcher on growth hormone  and from 1961 to 1963  worked at the Endocrinology Branch  National Cancer Institute  with Drs. William D. Odell and Peter G. Condliffe on immunologic studies of purified human and bovine thyrotropin (TSH). This work led to Bob’s single-authored landmark publication “Radioimmunoassay of Human Plasma Thyrotropin ” published in theJournal of Clinical Investigationin 1965. The TSH assay is still one of the most commonly ordered tests in all of medicine because of its utility in identifying patients who have thyroid dysfunction. This was the first of many papers dealing with the hypothalamic-pituitary regulation of the thyroid gland  a topic Bob returned to repeatedly during his career. His first academic position was in the Department of Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine  where he was selected a Markle Scholar  a highly prestigious award given to select faculty at US and Canadian medical schools.In 1969  he was recruited to the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Arnold Relman  eventually becoming a Professor of Medicine and the Chief of Endocrinology. During his time at Penn  Bob developed one of the first radioimmunoassays for the active thyroid hormone  triiodothyronine (T3)  and used it in a remarkably productive period of clinical research with his fellows  who included Drs. Peter Snyder and Charles Emerson  both of whom have become prominent endocrinologists  in their own right. These studies dealt with the physiology and pathophysiology of the thyroid hormone feedback regulation of TSH using thyrotropin-releasing hormone as a tool in both humans and animals. Later  he turned to the study of thyroxine (T4) to T3 conversion  working with Michael Kaplan  David Gardner  Tony Jennings  and Mansour Saberi  investigating the biochemistry of Type 1 deiodinase  the effect of fasting and illness on the pituitary-thyroid axis and on the inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion in response to that stress. One of these papers  published inThe New England Journal of Medicinein 1979  is still cited as the definitive demonstration that the endogenous reduction of T4 to T3 conversion in fasting humans ameliorates the negative protein balance of that condition. As Chief of the Endocrinology section at Penn  Bob was a respected and important member of the faculty  where he excelled as a teacher and clinical consultant.In 1979  Bob moved to the University of North Carolina to be a Professor of Medicine and the Director of General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). As GCRC Director  he was literally the embodiment of the Center. He immersed himself in the research programs of all the lead investigators who used the facility. To the members of the GCRC Committee  it always seemed that he knew more  or at least as much  about every study as did the Principal Investigator. With his typical generosity  he devoted countless hours to reviewing protocols  solving technical problems  and facilitating everyone’s work. He was extremely helpful to Fellows and junior faculty in designing clinical research projects and helped young faculty members establish careers in clinical investigation. It was not unusual for him to devote extensive time and effort to heavily edit someone else’s R01 grant and he comprehensively read and edited almost every grant that was submitted by the physicians who used the Center. He also continued his own work on thyroid physiology  which had a very strong human investigation focus.Bob was also a superb physician-teacher as well as physician-scientist and was greatly admired by the students  house staff  and clinical Fellows  as well as faculty colleagues. All of these groups sought his opinion on difficult clinical cases as well as challenging research projects. When he announced that he was leaving to come to Boston  the Associate Chief of the Medical Service was distraught because he did not know “to whom he could go to for endocrine consultations.” During his time at the University of North Carolina  he also served as Editor-in-Chief ofThe Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism(JCEM) the premier journal in its field. He also began his collaboration with Dr. Lewis Braverman as co-editor ofThe Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text  the classic in its field  an effort which spanned 18 years and four editions.In 1990  Bob returned to Boston as Deputy Editor ofThe New England Journal of Medicineand Clinical Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. At theJournal  he served first under Dr. Arnold Relman (with whom he had worked at the University of Pennsylvania) and later with Dr. Jerome Kassirer focusing on endocrine studies. It is in these two editorial capacities  with theJCEMand theNEJM  that many of the world’s endocrinologists were exposed to the depth of Bob’s knowledge and his high standards for succinct communication. The final hurdle for publication in these journals was responding to an all too often sentence-by-sentence  unbiased but vigorous critique of what was often thought by the authors to be the “final” version of the paper. Typically  the manuscript pages were virtually covered by a sea of red ink. While disconcerting  Bob’s comments invariably educated the authors in the art of scientific communication and often included substantive contributions to the research  even to topics in which the authors were the acknowledged world authorities. During the ten years that he served as a Deputy Editor of theNew England Journal of Medicine  he played an important role in its success. His good judgment  intelligence  and his unfailing instinct for ethical behavior in research and medical journalism were of inestimable assistance to the Editors  who came to rely very heavily on his advice.With his retirement fromThe New England Journalin 2000  Bob became a full-time member of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s (BWH) Thyroid Division  which later was merged into the Division of Endocrinology  Diabetes and Hypertension. He assumed a new responsibility  editingClinical Thyroidology  a quarterly review journal of the recent thyroid-related literature sponsored by the American Thyroid Association  and focused the rest of his efforts on teaching  mentoring and patient care. He also was an important member of the BWH Institutional Review Board. In his leadership role on the Institute of Medicine-sponsored Committee on the Health and Environmental Effects of Perchlorate  he summarized their deliberations in both written and oral testimony for Congress. It was in this period also that we at the Brigham were treated first-hand to his skills as a teacher  a consummate clinician  as well as his truly encyclopedic knowledge of endocrinology. As far as we could tell  he had never forgotten any article he had read  and it seemed he had read virtually everything. During our weekly clinical Grand Rounds  he would typically support his comments with the most relevant literature  mention the lead author  journal  and year of publication  and summarize and critique the conclusions. As one might imagine  he was in great demand by the fellows as a clinical attending and gave of his time unstintingly to them as well as to students  residents  attendings  and  of course  to his patients.Bob received numerous honors  including the Van Meter Prize and the Distinguished Service Award of The American Thyroid Association  as well as the Sidney H. Ingbar Distinguished Service Award of The Endocrine Society. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to teaching and clinical care  the Endocrinology Division at the Brigham has named our main conference room in his honor. It was in this room that he shared so much of his knowledge and superb clinical judgment with all of us.This summary of Bob’s many accomplishments unfortunately cannot capture his wry sense of humor and his everyday thoughtfulness for his colleagues  his students and his patients. He was the epitome of the Academic Physician  a scholar  physician  teacher  and friend and a role model for each of us to emulate. We have attempted in this short space to do justice to this uniquely generous individual. We hope we have succeeded.Respectfully submitted P. Reed Larsen  M.D.Arnold S. Relman  M.D.David R.

Julius Benjamin Richmond,Julius Benjamin Richmond  M.D.  Professor of Health Policy  Emeritus in the Faculty of Medicine was born in Chicago  the son of Russian Jewish immigrants  on 26 September  1916. He died at his home in Brookline  MA on 27 July  2008. Few individuals have had as great an impact on health  health care  and the well-being of children. He left us all a rich legacy.To understand his many contributions as a mentor  author  expert witness  designer and implementer of programs and policies  and concerned citizen  one must first understand the man. Julius Richmond — known to all as “Julie” or as “JBR” — was a son of Chicago  the Chicago of Carl Sandburg  Studs Terkel  ­­­­­­­­­­­­­Daniel Burnham  and Jane Addams. The first wrote the epic poem “The People Yes ” the second had a love affair with the “common” folk whose lives he chronicled  the third reminded us to “Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood ” and the last translated her ideas into social activism. Julie was about people  all people  about great ideas and plans  and about seeking social justice. Julius Richmond spent most of his life in the East. Nevertheless  though he left Chicago  Chicago never left him.His early years were difficult  but he found the groundwork for his life’s concerns on a farm midst goats and lambs. He observed and studied the relationship of lambs to their mothers and to goat foster mothers  the capacity of sheep and goats to adopt strange kids and lambs  and the impact of the infant on the mother and of the mother on the infant. These experiences fueled his deep interest in and commitment to issues in child development  a field which he pioneered after graduating the University of Illinois Medical School in 1939  doing his internship at Cook County Hospital  serving as a flight surgeon in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II  and — after discharge — completing his residency in pediatrics at Cook County and Chicago’s municipal contagious disease hospitals.In 1953  he moved to the State University of New York at Syracuse College of Medicine (now known as the Upstate Medical Center). There he and his colleague  Bettye Caldwell  established a pioneering daycare center for infants as young as six months of age and focused their research efforts on cognitive abilities developed during a child’s first years. They devoted particular attention to children who faced special risks due to their family’s social and disadvantaged economic status.This pioneering work demonstrated that cognitive and emotional stimulation made a substantial difference in the development of children. It helped focus attention on psychological  social  and behavioral dimensions of health in addition to the more traditional narrower focus on physical well being. It was this work that led Sargent Shriver  the “general” in President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty  to recruit Julie to serve as the first National Director of Project Head Start. The call came in January of 1965 and by that summer half a million children from poor families were enrolled in Head Start programs. The programs went beyond learning letters  numbers  and colors and involved the acquisition of concepts and social skills. Parents were intimately involved in the effort and in a broad conceptual scheme health and nutritional needs were addressed as well. What Julie helped put into place  survives. Head Start recently enrolled its 25 millionth child  is deeply embedded in our national strategy on behalf of children  and provides a daily reminder of how much can be accomplished through vision  conviction  commitment  dedication  and hard work.Had Julie only launched Head Start on its high-impact trajectory  it would have been enough. But he did much more and did it at the very same time. While at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) he worked informally with the health staff of the OEO community action program to develop the neighborhood health centers program that brought needed health and other services to deprived neighborhoods and populations. It is worth remembering that it was Senator Edward Kennedy who steered the first $50 million Neighborhood Health Center amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act to passage. That was not the only time that Dr. Richmond “recruited” Senator Kennedy in support of forward looking legislation. Many of the services offered in these centers were provided by newly-trained members of the affected communities. In time  those neighborhood health centers evolved into the community health centers that now are an important part of the infrastructure undergirding America’s health care delivery system. Today there are over 1 100 such centers servicing more than 17 million individuals. If Julie was the father of Head Start  it can be said that he was the midwife at the birth of Neighborhood Health Centers.And  of course  there is much more. In 1966  Julie was honored by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) with the C. Anderson Aldrich award in Child Development  the Academy’s highest honor in the field. In accepting the award Julie challenged the profession to view child development as a basic science of pediatrics in which theory and methodology would guide rigorous investigation. Further  he argued that psychosocial aspects of child development needed to be incorporated into pediatric training. He understood that this view would face opposition from those who considered biologic research as “hard” science and were loath to incorporate what they viewed as “softer” social science data. He  therefore  influenced the Executive Committee of the AAP to establish a Section on Child Development to provide a forum for communication  stimulate interest in research  and foster educational activities for pediatricians and others. For Julie it was not enough to “have an idea.” It was necessary to translate the idea into action  to institutionalize child development as a basic science for pediatrics. A younger generation may not grasp how “radical” his views were. Today  forty years after his Aldrich address  developmental and behavioral pediatrics is recognized as an academic discipline with subspecialty board status. As with Head Start and Neighborhood Community Health Centers which remain integral to the American scene  so with Julie Richmond’s vision for pediatrics.Julius Benjamin Richmond was not yet done. He came to Harvard University with appointments in the Medical School  the School of Public Health  and the Kennedy School of Government  serving at the same time at Boston’s Children’s Hospital and as Director of the Judge Baker Guidance Center and for a time as Chair of the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Washington and public service called once again. In 1977 he took leave from his Boston activities and accepted appointment as both Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General in the Carter administration.He accomplished much even in a period of fiscal retrenchment. During his tenure he issued two highly influential reports: a 1 200 page Report published on the 15th anniversary of Surgeon General Luther Terry’s original report linking smoking to lung cancer and other serious diseases and a second report Healthy People: The Surgeon General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. The smoking report was praised for its comprehensiveness and rigor  the scrupulous review process of research studies on smoking and its health effects  and its medical precision. It is fair to say that the report ended the so called “debate” about tobacco and its effects. Julie had declared “case-closed.” It took years for the full impact of the report to be felt and for the “cover-up” to be fully exposed and recognized  but the trend was inexorable. Not surprisingly  this work equipped him to be an expert witness in various class action suits brought against the tobacco industry. His credibility and knowledge were important in the suit brought by non-smoking flight attendants who had suffered harm from passengers who smoked. The industry settled this suit for $300 million which was used to create the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute (FAMRI)  a foundation which sponsors scientific investigation of the harms of second-hand smoke. Dr. Richmond served as FAMRI’s first medical director. Once again his efforts were institutionalized.The second report on health promotion and disease prevention redirected attention from the traditional emphasis on resource inputs and access to assessments of outcomes  including assessments of health functioning  reductions in morbidity and increases in life-expectancy  and changes in health status. Importantly  the Report set specific and measurable goals for health promotion for various population groups. The shift in emphasis was yet another “big idea” and once again Julie created something which endures: the assessment and setting of goals has been followed at ten year intervals and is now part of the American health scene. We measure where we are and agree upon attainable goals that require sustained action. We return to see whether we have achieved those goals  assess why we have failed on those that proved beyond our reach  and set out anew to seek improvement.Dr. Richmond returned to Harvard and to his work in Boston. He did not come back to “rest on his laurels ” though there were many lectures  commemorations  commendations  and honorary degrees in the offing. Rather  he returned to resume his activities in planning research activities across the university  meeting with colleagues  writing numerous articles  editorials  op-ed pieces  and a book on health care. He raised his voice and pen against complacency  on behalf of major reform of the health delivery and financing system  and on behalf of social justice. He believed that success is based on three interacting ingredients: a requisite scientific knowledge base  a social strategy that would utilize that knowledge base  and a political strategy that would gain support for the strategy. That is how he fought for a better world.Even so  he found the time to meet with all who wanted to come through his open door. Those who did benefitted from his remarkable capacity for meeting with  listening to  inspiring us all and somehow getting us – perhaps especially younger colleagues – to offer comments and ideas we had never believed we had in us. Like the greatest ball players he made those on his team (and all were on his team) perform better. He worked to build bridges between disciplines and as well between individuals who might learn from one another’s ideas and activities. In his writing and lectures  and perhaps above all in his conversation in which he wanted to talk about you and your ideas  he inspired a long list of persons who would wish to carry on his work.Julie Richmond lived a full life. He was blessed with his first wife Rhee  who died in 1985  and as well with his surviving wife Jean. He was proud of his three sons  Barry  Charles  and Dale  and grieved deeply at Dale’s untimely death. He accomplished much and much of what he accomplished was due to his love of people. Harvard put it well when  in awarding him an honorary degree  it stated: “Farsighted architect of initiatives in health  master builder of bridges linking academy and community  for whom nothing is more precious than the life of a child.”Respectfully submitted Rashi Fein  ChairpersonAllan BrandtLeon EisenbergNancy OriolJudith PalfreyLisbeth SchorrJack Shonkoff
Darrel B. Hoff dies at 76,Darrel B. Hoff  76  who taught at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) for six years  died on Nov. 2 at the Winneshiek Medical Center in Decorah  Iowa.He is survived by his wife  Ardith; his children  Andrea Hoff of Pflugerville  Texas  and Adrian Hoff of Fayette  Iowa; one brother  Duane Hoff of Viroqua  Wis.; and two grandchildren.
Donald Harnish Fleming,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on October 6  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Donald Harnish Fleming Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History  Emeritus  died in June 2008 after 41 years of service to Harvard University. A scholar of intellectual history and the history of science and medicine  he was the latest in a long line of Harvard’s charismatic lecturers on history who informed and delighted generations of students with brilliant  compelling lectures—witty and epigrammatic  yet packed with details of the ideas  assumptions  and beliefs of philosophers  social and physical scientists  and literary figures and their critics.Following his undergraduate years at Johns Hopkins University  Fleming completed his doctorate at Harvard in 1947  and three years later published his first  prize-winning book  both biographic and thematic  “John William Draper and the Religion of Science.” The research for that work drew him into the detailed history of medicine  which he explored in his second book  again both biographic and thematic  “William H. Welch and the Rise of Modern Medicine” (1954). By then Professor of History at Brown University  he had become prominent as a leading intellectual historian. After a year at Yale (1958-1959)  he accepted an appointment at Harvard  where he remained for the rest of his career. He served as chairman of the history department from 1963 to 1965 and as director of the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History from 1973 to 1980.Well before his move to Harvard  his scholarship had come to center on the view that there were key concepts  central foundational ideas embedded in certain words that radiated out through the humanities and the social and physical sciences  and that could be traced in their various ramifications. “What is required ” he wrote in his fullest programmatic statement of his research and writing  is “a record of the principal mutations that key words have undergone  the overlapping of territory among closely related words  the struggle for survival and predominance…in short  the application of the principle of natural selection to words.” He planned at one point to write a multi-volume history of science in America in precisely these terms  and indeed he drafted the first volume of a projected trilogy. But the complexities were enormous  and he chose instead to explore them in seminal essays  epitomes of the larger work as he envisioned it. One such paper was on the concept of Attitude in its elaborate radiation through the humanities and social and physical sciences; another mapped the ramifications of the concept of Conservation. Both were published in the journal he co-edited  “Perspectives in American History.Editing that publication—an annual volume of monographic essays—became a central part of his work from 1967 to 1986. He scrutinized the contributions  edited them rigorously to maintain the standards he valued  and he rejected  without fear or favor  those he deemed insufficient or only plausible. He edited with a perfectionist zeal which  when directed to the contributions of his own immediate colleagues  earned him no friends. He was equally rigorous and demanding in his contributions to the main work of the history department: devising the curriculum and recommending scholars for appointment. In both  he insisted on maintaining the most rigorous standards. But the chief target of his perfectionism was himself. He strove to meet his own extraordinary standards  which were increasingly devoted to teaching rather than publishing. His classroom lectures  rewritten every year and delivered from notes that fill 200 meticulously typed pages  were major intellectual performances  into which he poured his learning and his passion for the life of the mind  at the same time seeking to convey to students at various levels his unique theory of the evolutionary history of ideas  together with the information required for their education. That effort and his careful supervision of an increasing number of graduate students  consumed much of his energy. For them  he embodied and enforced his own stringent standards  expecting them to read widely in multiple languages and to write precisely with a self-critical eye; yet he extended to sometimes trembling students a tolerance for imperfection he never permitted himself.But all of this—his pursuit of knowledge and his efforts to convey its essence to his students—was only one facet of his life. As rigorous  demanding  and unrelenting as he was in his professional life  so indulgent  generous  welcoming  and charming he was in his social life. A bachelor  he was a connoisseur of art  a gourmet who became legendary in the best restaurants of Boston and Cambridge  a book collector of enormous capacity (his Widener study was famous for its solid  ceiling-high barricades of books)  and an enlivening companion on all sorts of social occasions. He could turn the smallest encounter  with the most obscure acquaintance  into a memorable event. His colleagues’ children  as well as their parents  relished his company. So did others outside the university. In his frequent rounds through a leading local bookstore  its manager recalled in a note to his staff and affiliates  Fleming would “cajole  joke  and literally test our wits  tossing out bon mots that it would be impolite not to answer. You hoped your answer would make him laugh. He was formal and correct—a small man in a bow tie  camel hair coat  and a fedora  with patrician diction  and [yet he was]…thoroughly unpretentious.”Fleming did not live to complete his projected history of science  but he left behind substantial and original works of historical scholarship  a number of brilliant essays  and the image of a wonderfully learned scholar who creatively engaged with his students and the company around him. One of his admiring graduate students  considering the complexity of Fleming’s persona—his intimidating erudition and casual charm  his intellectual rigor and welcoming amiability—described him as “gloriously improbable.” So he was  to the great benefit of his students  colleagues  and friends.Respectfully submitted Oscar HandlinErnest R.

Paul Goldhaber,Dean emeritus Paul Goldhaber  who was appointed dean at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) by then Harvard President Nathan Pusey in 1968 and served as Dean for 22 years  died July 14  2008  at the age of 84. He is survived by his wife Ethel and his sons Dr. Samuel Goldhaber and Dr. Joshua Goldhaber. Although he never pressured his sons to go into medicine  he was very proud that they chose to do so and that both have risen to the heights of their professions at Harvard and University of California  Los Angeles. He was also extremely proud that these two professor sons gave back-to-back presentations at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Cardiology Grand Rounds.Born March 16  1924  the eldest of three sons of Polish immigrants  Paul grew up in New York City speaking Yiddish as his first language. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School in New York City.After joining the U.S. Army he was chosen for its Specialized Training Program for gifted enlistees to go to college during wartime. He graduated from New York University College of Dentistry with a D.D.S. degree in 1948. While in the service and college  he met and married Ethel Renee Gurland  whose father was a dentist. Leaving the Army after active duty during the Korean War as a first lieutenant in the Dental Corps  he completed his undergraduate work at City College of New York while finishing his periodontology specialty training at Columbia University.He became an HSDM research assistant in 1954  associate in oral pathology in 1956; assistant Professor of oral pathology in 1959  associate professor of periodontology in 1962  and professor of periodontology in 1966. He belonged to many scientific societies  foremost of which was the Institute of Medicine  and was president of the International Association of Dental Research  the highest office in the world of dental research  which was also one of his favorites  as he loved meeting and socializing with academics throughout the world.With a passion for research and an insatiable curiosity  he worked tirelessly. Believing that research had a “multiplier effect ” he cherished the opportunity to pursue lab work and to encourage others to do the same. Dr. Goldhaber was determined to demonstrate that dentists could and would be recognized as scientists and clinicians on a par with physicians. He often pointed out that dentists were in fact de facto oral physicians and  given that medicine is part of their degree  thought they should consider renaming themselves oral physicians. Paul also recommended that on annual health surveys there be a box asking if you ever had periodontal disease. Moreover  his determination to remain the compleat clinical scientist kept him treating patients until his administrative responsibilities no longer made it possible. Thus  in the largest sense of being a scholar  he truly was a world-class “physician scientist” and teacher.As one of the longest-serving deans at Harvard University — and the first Jewish Dean — he reinforced the recognition of HSDM as part of the Faculty of Medicine and the University. At one of the first Faculty of Medicine staff meetings held soon after Paul became Dean  the then Dean of HMS  introduced a matter of general interest for the faculty. When the Dean was asked by Paul what role the School of Dental Medicine would play in this area  the dean answered  “I forgot about the School of Dental Medicine.” Paul countered  “Please don’t ever forget the School of Dental Medicine again.” And to his credit  he only rarely did.Paul improved HSDM in many ways. Not only did he expand its education program with new courses in critical thinking and research methodology and add new and innovative clinical internships in Harvard-affiliated hospitals  but most important  he also increased its endowment  international reputation  and acceptance of women and minorities. Simultaneously  he aggressively pursued funding from the National Institutes of Health  foundations  and other sources  thereby providing new opportunities for faculty and students  such as training grants for advanced graduate study by clinical scholars  He also appreciated the role of the behavioral sciences in the diagnosis  etiology  and managements of dental disease in his research and curriculum development.With publications and presentations numbering in the hundreds  he was a prolific contributor to science  medicine  and education. As a scientist  he was renowned universally as a leader in the biology of bone destruction. While his research began with questions about the cause of bone loss associated with periodontal disease  he went well beyond that. He was one of the first to champion medical management of periodontal disease and developed improved diagnostic procedures such as the use of nuclear medicine to detect bone activity in sites susceptible to periodontal disease. Throughout the 1960’s he developed a critical and acclaimed experimental system for observing bone resorption in vitro at the cellular level  in relation to the mouse calvarium model. He readily adapted this system to studies of general medical and metabolic problems. His work was published in a seminal paper in the New England Journal of Medicine “Some current concepts of bone physiology ” in 1962.As an outstanding researcher and clinician in medicine and dentistry  Dr. Goldhaber recognized the rapid advances in all the biomedical sciences  realizing that dentists as well as physicians could not learn what was needed in four years of professional school. Although medical students continued their training as interns  residents  and fellows  general practice residencies for dentists at that time were the exception rather than the rule. Thus  to assure that HSDM graduates would be properly trained as leaders of the future  he initiated a five-year program. In addition to more clinical training  the extra year provided an opportunity for students to study throughout the world  to complete a more significant mandatory original research project and/or pursue a complementary professional master’s degree from the Harvard School of Public Health  Harvard Kennedy School of Government  or Harvard Graduate School of Education. Although he initially questioned the idea of the double D.M.D./M.D. program for dentists  he soon recognized the reality that specialists such as maxillofacial surgeons would better serve society with both degrees  hence the successful implementation with Harvard Medical School of the combined program.Perhaps his greatest accomplishment as dean and professor was the number of students who became deans and/or assumed leadership positions at academic institutions around the world. At least a dozen future dental school deans and nearly fifty other notable academicians  clinical scholars  academic health center administrators  and scientists graduated from doctoral or postdoctoral programs associated with HSDM during his time in office. He was incredibly proud of these former students who became leaders in dental medicine  as well as in academic health center administration  as he in turn was grateful to those who had mentored him.Although Paul Goldhaber held strong views  he welcomed disagreement and received considerable pleasure from debates with worthy opponents. He always spoke his mind and never gave false compliments. On the lighter side  he liked heavy opera  especially “The Pearl Fishers ”  and even heavier corned beef sandwiches and half sour pickles. Many years ago  Paul and a colleague were walking on Longwood Avenue. They heard a couple of students talking  unaware of their presence. One of them said to the other  “Don’t worry about the Goldhaber and Epstein exam [at that time those two were the entire department]. They ask the same questions every year.” Paul stopped  confronted the abashed students  and said  “Yes  but the answers are different every year.”In summary  having been enriched by his keen intellect  devotion to scholarly activities  love for everything about Harvard  as well as his accomplishments in research and education  and most important his friendship  we are all greatly saddened by the loss of one of the giants of the health professions in the twentieth century.Respectfully submitted Donald B.

Theodore Sizer dies at 77,Onetime Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) Dean Theodore Sizer  who spent half a century as a teacher  education reformer  leader  author  and mentor  died Oct. 21 at his Harvard  Mass.  home. He was 77.“Ted’s contributions to education are numerous and far-reaching ” said HGSEDean Kathleen McCartneyin a statement to the Ed School community. “As a member of the HGSE faculty  as dean  and as a visionary in education  Ted made an enduring impact through his teaching and scholarship  but also his unsurpassed wisdom and insight. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife  Nancy  his four children  and all of Ted’s family and friends.”In 1964  at only 31  Sizer (M.A.T. ’57  Ph.D. ’61) was named dean. Leaving the Ed School in 1972  he took over Phillips Academy in Andover. After nine years there  Sizer joined Brown University as a professor and founded two instrumental educational organizations: the Annenberg Institute for School Reform and the Coalition for Essential Schools.To read thefull obituary.
Mary Lee Ingbar  pioneer in field of health economics  dies at 83,Mary Lee Ingbar  Radcliffe ’46  Ph.D. ’53  M.P.H. ’56  who was a pioneer in applying quantitative and sophisticated computer analysis to the developing field of health economics in the 1950s and 1960s  died in Cambridge  on Sept. 18.Ingbar was especially interested in the relationships between cost  quality  and outcomes of medical care.  She brought insights from the fields of econometrics and operations research to bear upon the variability of the costs of medical care from one health care setting to another; to this end  she developed what in all likelihood was the first comprehensive statistical and econometric computer software program for analyzing hospital costs. In this work  she collaborated closely with Professor John Dunlop of Harvard (later U.S. secretary of labor) and Lester D. Taylor.  She and Taylor wrote “Hospital Costs in Massachusetts” (Harvard University Press  1968)  one of the first econometric studies of hospital costs ever to be published.In the early 1970s  while associate professor of health economics at the University of California  San Francisco  Medical School  Ingbar was a member of the California Hospital Commission  where she participated in the design and implementation of an innovative program for detailed reporting of hospital expenses and health outcomes  which allowed comparisons of costs and efficiencies of care  and helped to establish the oversight of then-emerging forms of health care delivery  such as health maintenance organizations.In the late 1970s and 1980s  Ingbar worked to advance the use of computerized databases to track health care events  costs  and outcomes in medical care delivery systems that were growing increasingly large and complex. During these years  she held professorships at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and at the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.Ingbar remained a principal research associate of the Department of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School for the remainder of her life.  She served as an Overseer for the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and as a member of the Corporation of Partners Healthcare System. Ingbar was very active in the American Public Health Association (APHA); she was a member of the APHA Governing Council and a chairperson of the APHA Medical Care Section. She was consultant on health economics to many organizations  and in recent years served on the Council of the Alumni Association of the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.Ingbar was born and raised in New York City. Her mother  Ruth P. Mack  was a noted economist. Her stepfather  Edward C. Mack  was a professor of English literature at the City College of New York.  John E. Mack  her stepbrother  was a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and received the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T.E. LawrenceMary Lee Ingbar was married to Sidney H. Ingbar  an internationally recognized expert on thyroid gland disease and William Bosworth Castle Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. She is survived by her three sons  David Ingbar  M.D. ’78  of Minneapolis; Eric Ingbar of Carson City  Nev.; and Jonathan Ingbar of Portland  Ore.Donations in honor of Mary Lee Ingbar may be made to theLung Cancer AllianceandHigh Horses Therapeutic Riding Program. A memorial will be held at a later date.
Economist Duesenberry dies at 91,James Stemble Duesenberry  an eminent economist who was an authority on monetary policy and a faculty member of Harvard University’s Department of Economics for more than half a century  recently passed away at his home in Cambridge at the age of 91.Duesenberry came to Harvard in 1948 as assistant professor of economics and became associate professor in 1953.   He received tenure in 1955  and became professor of economics.An economic theorist who strove to affect policy and improve economic conditions  Duesenberry was a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors from 1966 to 1968  in Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration.  From 1969 to 1974 he was chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  and he led the bank during the construction of the First National Bank Building in downtown Boston.“Jim Duesenberry was a very insightful man who thought deeply about problems in a way that was relatively unconstrained by the fashionable conditions of the day ” said Benjamin Friedman  William Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy  who was a colleague of Duesenberry’s.  “He thought that the purpose of economics was to speak to the way the economy behaves and what policy can do to improve economic performance.”In 1969  Duesenberry was named William Joseph Maier Professor of Money and Banking.  He was chair of the Department of Economics from 1972 to 1977  and led the department at a time when some called for greater intellectual diversity among the faculty.  He retired in 1989  and became William Joseph Maier Professor of Money and Banking Emeritus.Duesenberry’s first book  “Income Consumption and the Theory of Consumer Behavior” (Harvard University Press)  was published in 1949.  He is also the author of “Business Cycles and Economic Growth” (McGraw-Hill  1957)  “Money and Credit: Impact and Control” (Prentice-Hall  1964)  “Capital Needs in the Seventies” with Barry Bosworth and Andrew Carron (Brookings Institution  1975)  and “Money  Banking and Economy” with Thomas Mayer and Robert Z. Aliber (W.W. Norton  1981).Born in Princeton  W.Va.  Duesenberry received his B.A. in 1939  his M.A. in 1941  and his Ph.D. in 1948  all in economics from the University of Michigan.Duesenberry was a research fellow with the Social Science Research Council in 1941.  During World War II  Duesenberry was a statistician in the Air Force  and reached the rank of captain.  He was an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946  and in 1954  he was a Fullbright fellow at Cambridge University.Duesenberry is survived by his son John of Brookline  Mass.  and daughters Holly of Gouldsboro  Maine  and Peggy of Stirling  Scotland  as well as four grandchildren.
Memorial service to be held for Hastings,A memorial service for Hanna Machlup Hastings  former House master and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) administrator  will be held at 2 p.m. on Oct. 17. The service will take place at Pforzheimer House (56 Linnaean St.) in the Holmes living room. A reception will follow.Hastings  who died peacefully in her sleep on June 15 after a long struggle with Parkinson’s disease  moved to the Boston area after her husband Woody was appointed to the Harvard faculty. In 1976  she and her husband were appointed co-masters of North (now Pforzheimer) House at Harvard — a post they held for 20 years. During that time Hanna completed an M.Ed. at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and served as director of student affairs at HSPH for 10 years.
Charles McCabe,Dr. Charles McCabe  senior surgeon and senior physician in Emergency Services at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School  died July 7  2008  after a protracted battle with melanoma  lymphoma  and multiple sclerosis. He was 60 years of age.“CJ ” “Charlie” or “Doc”  as he was known by all of those who loved him  was born on February 10  1948 in Asbury Park  New Jersey. A phenomenal athlete  he played football  basketball and baseball in high school before entering the University of Notre Dame  graduating in 1970. He then returned to New Jersey for his medical degree  graduating from the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry in 1974 having decided on a career in surgery. His wife  Rose  explains that one of the happiest days of his life was when he learned that he had matched for the surgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH); he entered his surgical residency in 1974 and proceeded to enter the cardiothoracic training program at the same hospital. On the cusp of graduation  illness — in the shape of multiple sclerosis — forced him to accept a different calling; that of teaching to medical students and residents the science  the art and the humanity of surgery. For the next 30 years  he immersed himself in this teaching to become the icon that — for many residents and students — formulated and shaped their surgical careers.He soon became a fixture in the MGH Emergency Department. Surgical residents performing their Emergency Department rotations and medical students (from Harvard Medical School and beyond) would come to “McCabe Rounds ” held in the MGH ED every morning at 6 a.m.  to go over the surgical cases that had been seen in the previous 24 hours. On every case he had a teaching point; sometimes it was the nature of the presentation of the surgical case; sometimes it was a point of operative technique or a discussion of the surgical complications. He considered every patient unique and that within every patient-physician interaction there was an opportunity for learning.He became the quintessential teacher of surgery at Harvard Medical School and for many future leaders of surgery he was their first mentor. Medical students returned his affection; he was named the Harvard Medical School Teacher of the Year on several occasions. Dr. Daniel Federman  the Carl W. Walter Distinguished Professor of Medicine and former Dean for Alumni Relations and Clinical Teaching at the Medical School said of Dr. McCabe  “He was the spokesman for surgical excellence in his teaching of students and residents.” and added that the school created a special faculty prize for sustained excellence in teaching  because he won — or was nominated for — awards so often.Charlie loved MGH — it was his second home. He knew everyone in the hospital and would always provide a word of encouragement to those in need. He was especially fond of his colleagues in the Police and Security Department at the hospital  as well as the EMS paramedics and EMT’s. They would always stop by his office after they had delivered a patient to the Emergency Department. Due to this interest  he became the State Medical Director for Massachusetts from 1983 to 1992 overseeing a dramatic growth in the scope and importance of the pre-hospital arena within the Commonwealth. His contributions and involvement led to the initiation of an annual award given by the State to the physician who has made the most outstanding contribution to Massachusetts EMS — the McCabe Award.He remained active clinically throughout his career; and even when his disability became severe  he would be seen in his wheelchair providing advice and counsel to the MGH ED faculty. Charlie was one of those mature physicians who had “seen it all;” and both junior and senior faculty would seek him out when facing particularly challenging cases.Charlie was a prodigious reader and writer. He was on the editorial board of several journals and every edition of the Journal of Emergency Medicine had “Pearls from the Literature” — a précis of new developments and papers that he knew were important for the practicing clinician. One could be certain that he had read all of the articles that he quoted; and you could be sure that he would only quote articles that were academically accurate and clinically important.But even more than his professional accomplishments  Charlie was a humanitarian:“It’s a beautiful day.”When anyone asked Dr. Charles McCabe how he was feeling  he always answered with that unique phrase. His optimism was contagious and he was quick to remind all that life was a precious gift that should be enjoyed to the fullest. He was a realist and — much more than he ever let his friends know — understood when the end was near. Typical for Charlie — he organized his own farewell. At the time of his last hospitalization  he summoned his colleagues and friends to his room to bid them farewell over his last few days. He insisted that at his memorial service  everyone was to wear bright and pastel colors; it was to be a celebration of life and not of his passing. We all attended as he wished; the church was packed and the crowd overflowed into the street — the street had to be closed. The celebration of his life was everything that Charlie would wish it to be.He leaves behind his wife of 37 years  Rose  and his daughter  Krista. He also leaves his two sisters  Charlene and Marybeth  and his brother  Jay.Respectfully submitted Alasdair Conn  chairpersonWilliam ColemanCharles Ferguson
Liem  professor of ichthyology  dies at 74,Henry Bryant Bigelow Professor of Ichthyology Karel Frederik Liem  an expert on the functional anatomy  evolution  and physiology of fishes and curator of ichthyology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ)  died on Sept. 3 at the age of 74. Liem had devoted 37 years of his life to research and to the education of students at Harvard  and he won teaching awards from the University of Illinois and from Harvard. Liem also served as co-master of Dunster House with his wife  Hetty  for 12 years.Born in 1935 in Jakarta  Indonesia  to a Chinese father and Dutch mother  Liem received a bachelor’s and then a master’s degree from the University of Indonesia  finishing in 1958. He was awarded a Ph. D. by the University of Illinois in 1961. Liem taught at the University of Leiden in Holland and at the University of Illinois  and held a curatorial position at Chicago’s Field Museum. He was recruited in 1972 by the MCZ. For many years Liem co-taught the large introductory evolutionary biology (“Bio 2”) course at Harvard.  His lectures were celebrated among students for their depth and eloquence  for the way Liem filled the blackboard with free-flowing multicolored drawings  and  above all  for the humor he traded freely with his students.Liem leaves behind his wife  Hetty Khouw Liem; a son  Karel F. Liem Jr.; and a daughter  Erika Liem. A memorial gathering is planned at the MCZ later this fall.
Ernest Edward Williams,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on May 19  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Ernest Williams was a man of many contrasts. Biology at Harvard in the third quarter of the last century was full of outsized personalities—titans in the field with strong opinions and no reservations about expressing them. In such company  Williams appeared a wallflower  seemingly wishing to be anywhere but in the midst of their arguments. Yet  one-on-one  Williams had an incisive wit and a dry sarcasm—discussions with him were always stimulating and provocative as he never missed a chance to challenge one’s thinking  sometimes quite pointedly.To some  Williams’s work came across as old-fashioned. His subject  systematics — the study of the evolutionary relationships of species—is among the oldest in science  and his papers — florid and opinionated and  above all  long—recalled an approach to scholarship no longer in vogue. Yet much of his work was boldly innovative; some papers are still widely cited  and in several cases his work was well ahead of its time  presaging approaches to the study of evolutionary biology that were not to catch on for several decades.Ernest Edward Williams was born January 7  1914  in Easton  Pennsylvania  the only child of middle-aged parents. Like many boys  particularly of that time  he grew up loving nature and spent many hours capturing salamanders and other creatures. After attending Lafayette College  Williams joined the Army  serving in Europe during World War II. Upon his return  Williams entered graduate school at Columbia University  where he was the last graduate student of the great anatomist William King Gregory.Williams’s doctoral thesis focused on the structure of the neck vertebrae of turtles and how variation among species reflects their evolutionary heritage. The work demonstrated the combination of careful attention to detail with the ability to interpret results in the broader context that was to characterize Williams’s career. More than fifty years later the work is still foundational in understanding the evolution of turtle diversity.In 1950  after completing his degree  Williams moved to Harvard  where he initially served as a laboratory coordinator for the anatomy course of the legendary paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer  then subsequently was appointed as an assistant professor and made coordinator of a General Education course on evolution. The Museum of Comparative Zoology’s Curator of Herpetology  Arthur Loveridge  retired in 1957  and Williams was appointed to take his place.  In 1970 Williams rose to the rank of professor and in 1972 became Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology.Williams initially focused on continuing his work on turtle systematics  leading to a series of publications including a still-important treatise published with Loveridge in 1957. Williams soon realized  however  that the museum’s collections were inadequate for the detailed analysis he conceived  which required large samples from many populations. This recognition that the museum’s herpetological collections were wide in scope  but lacking in depth  led Williams in two directions. First  it compelled him to work greatly to expand the Herpetology Department’s holdings  ultimately leading to a quadrupling of the department’s collections (to more than 300 000 specimens) by the time he retired as curator in 1980  making the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) one of the greatest herpetological repositories in the world. Second  it led Williams’s attention to focus on lizards in the genusAnolis  a very species-rich group from the Caribbean and Central and South America. A previous curator of herpetology and director of the MCZ  Thomas Barbour  had extensively collected anoles in the Caribbean; Williams  whose focus was much more evolutionarily-oriented than most systematists of the day  recognized that this group could be a model for studying large-scale evolutionary and biogeographical phenomena.And  indeed  they were  and still are. Williams recognized that anoles have diversified for the most part independently on each of the major islands of the Caribbean (Cuba  Hispaniola  Jamaica  and Puerto Rico); most remarkably  the end-result of these evolutionary radiations has been very similar  with the same set of habitat specialists — which Williams labeled “ecomorphs ” a term now widely employed in evolutionary biology — evolving independently on each island. Such convergence of entire faunas is a rare phenomenon andAnolishas become a textbook example.Williams’s work on anole evolution synthesized a wide variety of fields  including biogeography  functional morphology  population genetics  behavior  and ecology. Yet  Williams was a systematist by training  with little background in most of these areas. The primary means by which Williams orchestrated this broad-based investigation of anole diversity was his ability to identify the best organismally minded graduate students in Harvard’s biology department  regardless of their specific interests. As a result  the list of Williams’s graduate students reads like a Who’s Who in ecology and evolutionary biology.At a time when the MCZ’s curators had little say in curricular matters  Williams pioneered a highly popular course on vertebrate biology. This course  which Williams taught for many years  helped keep organismal biology alive at Harvard and was a crucial step in the creation of the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB).Williams was not the most gentle-hearted of advisors. Gruff and very critical  he had high standards  expected students and colleagues to meet them  and was not shy about letting them know when they had not. Words of praise were not handed out liberally  but were cherished when received. With undergraduates  however  Williams showed a different side  being supportive and encouraging when needed and available at any time for discussion and advice. A number of Harvard undergraduates who worked with him have gone on to become evolutionary biologists  and several have continued to work on anoles  in many cases following up on ideas he initially conceived.Williams remained active after his retirement from the Harvard faculty in 1984  continuing his evolutionary and systematic studies. Eventually  he moved back to his native Pennsylvania  where he died in 1998  taking his encyclopedic font of knowledge with him. Nonetheless  his spirit and ideas live on in the form of his many academic descendants  which include many prominent active scientists  several members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences  a high-ranking U.S. government official  and the current curator of herpetology of the MCZ.Respectfully submitted A.

Leon Eisenberg  pioneering child psychiatrist  dies at 87,Leon Eisenberg  the Maude and Lillian Presley Professor of Social Medicine Emeritus at Harvard Medical School (HMS)  died on Sept. 15 at the age of 87. A child psychiatrist  Eisenberg is known around the world for innovative research in autism  groundbreaking advances in pediatric clinical trials and psychopharmacology  and integration of social experience into the study of disease. He also was a leader of the Medical School’s affirmative action program  established in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968. Recently  Eisenberg had advocated for a rigorous code of ethics to avoid conflicts of interest in medicine and for depression screening in the primary care setting. In June  he was recognized by Children’s Hospital Boston with an endowment in his name.Born in Philadelphia in 1922  the son of Russian Jewish immigrants  Eisenberg grew up to be bookish and inquiring. He recalled in an interview the experience of listening to English translations of Hitler’s speeches on the radio. “Because of that extreme threat ” he said  “I remember talking to my father and both of us agreeing that the only thing they couldn’t take away from you was what you knew inside your head.” His father dreamed that his son would go to medical school  and Eisenberg could not remember wanting anything else.When his turn came to apply in 1942  medical schools had stingy quotas for Jews  he said. Eisenberg was turned down by all the schools he had chosen despite his nearly straight A’s in college. In despair  his father intervened with a Pennsylvania state legislator. Days later  a letter came saying that Eisenberg had been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.Eisenberg graduated as valedictorian of his medical school class. Yet he was denied  along with the seven other Jews who applied  an internship at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. He went to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York  where he discovered psychiatry. He was drawn to the field’s promise to “get in and understand things — myself and other people.”He was also intrigued by his first reading of Freud’s “The Interpretation of Dreams.” “It seemed such exciting and out-of-the-way stuff ” he once said. But he soon found psychoanalysis “politically unacceptable ” and asked  “How could you use a treatment that would take so long per person when the burden of mental illness was so high?”In 1952  after a two-year stint in the Army teaching physiology to military doctors  he began a residency in child psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University  where his doubts about psychoanalysis were encouraged by the great psychiatrist Leo Kanner.Just 10 years earlier  Kanner had identified 11 boys with an unusual constellation of traits: extreme social isolation  an inability to look people in the eye  a preoccupation with objects and ritual  and hand-flicking and other repetitive movements. Eisenberg would join him in his exploration of the newly identified psychiatric disorder  autism  paying special attention to the social and family setting of the children in which it appeared.“What is original and powerful about Leon’s conceptualization is the understanding that the biological and social are part of one thing ” said Felton Earls  professor of social medicine at HMS and professor of human behavior and development at the Harvard School of Public Health. “Biology is not compartmentalized from social reality. Very few people think like that.”Though Eisenberg suspected a genetic basis to the then rarely diagnosed disease  it would be years before the tools existed to look at it. In subsequent years  he turned his attention to more common childhood problems  such as school phobia  looking once again at the social setting in which they occurred.In 1962  Eisenberg launched the first randomized  placebo-controlled clinical trial of psychiatric medicine with children. “As simple as it seems  as straightforward  child psychiatry had gone on for 40 years before somebody did a randomized clinical trial ” said Earls.Only months after arriving to head the Psychiatry Department at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1967  Eisenberg was asked to join a small committee  including HMS professors Jon Beckwith  Ed Kravitz  David Potter  and Ed Furshpan  that was working to raise the number of African-American students at the School. Because of his experience with anti-Semitism  Eisenberg maintained a deep awareness of what it felt like to be excluded. His identification with those who face prejudice was at the heart of what he later considered his greatest achievement  the administrative restructuring that opened doors at the Medical School to a fuller  more diverse range of students. This push for affirmative action was galvanized by the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King.Eisenberg was asked to chair the HMS commission on black community relations and to chair the HMS admissions committee for seven years of the early affirmative action program. “It was a wonderful place to see to it that the plan was implemented ” he said.“Leon Eisenberg is one of the seminal figures in American medicine and in psychiatry of the past half century ” said Arthur Kleinman  the Esther and Sidney Rabb Professor of Anthropology at Harvard and professor of medical anthropology at HMS  who entered the Psychiatry Department soon after Eisenberg arrived. “He is surely one of Harvard’s greats.”Eisenberg leaves his wife  Carola  an HMS lecturer on social medicine and former dean of students at the School; children Kathy and Mark Eisenberg and stepchildren Alan and Larry Guttmacher; grandchildren Nadja and Jerzy Eisenberg-Guyot  Joshua and Rachel Guttmacher  and John and Kathleen Thornton; daughters-in-law Kristin Guyot  Blake Adams  Terry Caffery  and Brigid Guttmacher; and sisters Essie Ellis and Libby Wickler.

Robert Timmons McCluskey,Robert T. McCluskey  a pioneer in the field of immunopathology  died June 29  2006 at the age of 83. He was the Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology  emeritus at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and former pathologist-in-chief at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).Dr. McCluskey “Mac” was born January 16  1923 in New Haven  Conn.  where he was raised with his older brother Donald.  He received his A.B. degree from Yale in 1944 and his M.D. degree from New York University (NYU) in 1947.  His training in pathology at King’s County and Bellevue Hospitals was followed by military service in Germany.  He returned as a faculty member in Pathology at the NYU School of Medicine under the direction of Lewis Thomas  who had created one of the premier pathology departments.  It was here that Mac met future Nobel Laureate Baruj Benacerraf  who became a lifelong friend. Other notables at NYU at the time were Stuart Schlossman  Gloria Gallo  and Chandler Stetson. Mac’s career blossomed and in 1962 he was appointed professor of pathology and director of the laboratories at NYU. In 1968 he was recruited to be chairman of pathology at the State University of New York at Buffalo  where he met Giuseppe Andres  who became a close friend and collaborator.In 1971  Benacerraf attracted Mac to Boston with his wife Jean and children James and Anne  to become the S. Burt Wolbach Professor and Chairman of Pathology at Children’s Hospital. Here he again crystallized a strong immunopathology group including Atul Bhan  Eveline Schneeberger  and Bernard Collins  all of whom stayed with him throughout the rest of his career.While serving on the search committee for Dr. Benjamin Castleman’s successor  Mac found himself a candidate for the position and in 1974 he became chief of pathology at MGH and the Mallinckrodt Professor of Pathology. In 1982 the Benjamin Castleman Professorship of Pathology was activated and Mac became the first incumbent. During his 17 years as leader of the MGH Department of Pathology  he expanded the staff and scope of the department  strengthening research  especially in immunopathology  and more than tripling the research space. Mac was a consummate politician and administrator  quiet  determined and with patience to await the opportune moment. As a result  he succeeded in consolidating the myriad clinical laboratory fiefdoms at the MGH into a single division of Laboratory Medicine. He did not tolerate any whispers of dishonesty. He also did not take on battles until the circumstances made winning more than likely. By the end of his term as chief  due largely to his superb administrative skills  the department was strong in all three branches of pathology — anatomic  clinical  and investigative — a solid base for the next chief  Robert Colvin  to build upon.Mac’s major scientific contributions were related to the immunopathogenesis of renal diseases  and while mostly basic  his insights invariably had applications to human disease. Over the course of 56 years as an investigator  he published 206 papers.Mac’s earliest investigative work was on permeability properties of the vascular endothelium in atherosclerosis with Sigmund Wilens. This led him to ask how vessels were injured by immune complexes. In the early 1950’s immune complex disease had emerged as a new mechanism of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis through the work of Frank Dixon and Frederick Germuth  but little was known of the factors involved. In a series of elegant experiments in mice with Benacerraf  Mac showed that preformed immune complexes themselves could initiate glomerular and vascular inflammation  through release of vasoactive amines. Later studies with Andres and John Klassen showed that immune complexes can deposit in the tubular basement membranes and cause autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis.The clotting system in glomerulonephritis was another of Mac’s early interests. With Pierre Vassalli  he showed fibrin deposition was a universal feature of glomerular crescents  a hallmark of the most severe forms of glomerulonephritis in patients.  Inhibition of the clotting system in animal models of glomerulonephritis had a beneficial effect  and this finding led to extensive clinical trials of anticoagulation for glomerulonephritis with crescents.Another early and continuing interest of Mac’s was the function of T cells in allergic diseases. His seminal study with his wife Jean and Benacerraf showed that only a minority of the T cells in a delayed hypersensitivity reaction were antigen specific  contrary to the dogma of the time (1963). This led to the concept of lymphokines and their ability to recruit T cells independent of specificity. His later studies showed that T cells could mediate tubulointerstitial nephritis to autologous or exogenous antigen and  with Bhan  showed that T cells contribute to glomerular inflammation  another concept that was heretical at the time.One of Mac’s lifelong goals was to find the autoantigen of membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN).  He worked extensively on a form of MGN produced by immunizing rats with an extract of autologous kidney. He identified the autoantigen and showed that it was expressed by the glomerular podocytes and tubules. With John Smith he cloned the antigen  now termed megalin. Unfortunately megalin turned out not to be the autoantigen of human MGN  but Mac pursued its function vigorously into his 70’s  discovering that it was a member of the LDL receptor family that bound to thyroglobulin and played a role in thyroid disease. His persistent quest for the function of megalin  even though it was not what he originally expected  shows his curiosity and joy in discovery.In the clinical realm  Mac was well known for his pioneering application of immunofluorescence to renal biopsies. He wrote a classic paper on the subject with Albert Coons at HMS  who invented the immunofluorescence technique. Mac was a key instigator of the WHO classification of lupus glomerulonephritis  which although modified by others many times over 30 years  has largely returned to his original formulation. With Ed Franklin of NYU  he described the new syndrome of mixed cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis  now known to be due largely to hepatitis C virus. Mac also wrote the classic study of the natural course of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis with David Baldwin and the first definitive description of drug induced allergic interstitial nephritis mediated by T cells.With John Niles  Mac investigated the pathogenesis of Wegener’s granulomatosis  a severe inflammatory glomerulonephritis and vasculitis that curiously has no detectable immune deposits. Mac’s interest was prompted by a report that this disease was associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). He led a group with Amin Arnaoult that cloned an autoantigen that is one of the targets of ANCA  protease-3.  This discovery led to a widely used diagnostic test for this family of diseases  as well as a new strategy to monitor disease activity. Mac was a key member of the Chapel Hill group that developed the currently used classification system for vasculitis. As an example of his iconoclastic bent  he showed that the usual cause of “Goodpasture’s syndrome” was not anti-GBM antibodies but ANCA. He also felt strongly that a positive ANCA test obviated the need for a renal biopsy  the very basis of his career.Mac worked hard to establish the nascent field of immunopathology. He wrote extensively about the techniques and interpretation in clinical practice  created and directed a two day biennial course on the subject at the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) meeting for 14 years  founded and was editor-in-chief of the journal Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology  and helped the new subspecialty get official recognition as a member of the original immunopathology test committee for the American Board of Pathology. He authored many definitive and critical reviews of his field  such as the chapter on immunologically mediated renal diseases in 3 editions of Pathology of the Kidney by his good friend Robert Heptinstall.  Mac’s clinical acumen was also reflected in 39 clinicopathological renal case discussions in the Case Records of the MGH in the New England Journal of Medicine.Mac was a leader in academic pathology and nephrology  serving as president of the USCAP and the International Academy of Pathology  councilor of the American Society of Nephrology  and member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the National Kidney Foundation. Among his awards are a Lifetime Achievement Award and Founders Award from the Renal Pathology Society  a society that had developed from his informal Kidney Club. He was the recipient of the Solomon A. Berson Medical Alumni Achievement Award (1985). He was a patient and much appreciated teacher of the pathology residents and fellows  who choose him at age 81 for the annual MGH Residents Teaching Award.Two awards are named in his honor. At the MGH  the Department of Pathology sponsors the Robert T. McCluskey Fellowship  which is given annually to an outstanding resident interested in research in immunopathology. At the Yale School of Medicine  his brother Donald McCluskey established in 2006 the Robert T. McCluskey Endowment that funds an early stage investigator for four years to pursue an idea of his or her choice  without restrictions.Mac was a remarkable human being. He was an avid reader of Shakespeare and was always ready with a pithy Elizabethan quote. For a decade he sponsored regular dramatic readings of Shakespeare with his friends on his porch  favoring the tragedies. His impeccable German was heard from time to time in a stirring rendition of Die Lorelei.  His piercing intellect  self-effacing manner  curiosity  and dry wit were his characteristic traits  as well as an uncanny ability to deflate the pompous with a choice remark.Mac’s life exemplified the joy of science. He loved nothing more than a good idea and an experiment to test it. He had the highest standard of truth  always thorough  thoughtful and skeptical. As Heptinstall noted in an award nomination letter for Mac  “I should like to record that when Mac assumed emeritus status at Harvard at the age of 70  rather than succumbing to the torpor of retirement on Cape Cod  he learned recombinant DNA technology and applied for — and obtained — an R01 to unravel the secrets of gp330.  This  I feel  shows his true character.”Mac bore the last months of his illness with enormous dignity and courage  working at the MGH until three months before he succumbed to prostate cancer. He kept his good humor until the end  enjoying conversations and letters from colleagues all over the world who had contacted him to say how much his friendship and guidance meant to their careers. His keen insights and delightful company will be missed the countless friends and colleagues and family.Respectfully submitted byBaruj BenacerrafNancy L. HarrisE. Tessa Hedley-WhyteRobert H.

Thomas Carlyle Jones,Thomas Carlyle Jones  known to his friends as Carl or T.C.  passed away at the age of 95 after a brief illness. The veterinary profession lost one of its most influential and respected leaders and the American College of Veterinary Pathologists lost its founder  as it was through the effort and vision of Carl Jones that led to the establishment of this venerable institution in 1948.Carl was born in Boise  Idaho  on September 29  1912. Dr. Jones’ interest in animals began at the age of 11 when he lived on a dairy farm; worked there one summer and later  while in high school  worked on a general farm during summer vacations. His first scientific interest was in dairy husbandry while attending the University of Idaho in his home state. After entering veterinary school at Washington State College in Pullman  Washington  his interest shifted to the diseases of dairy cattle. While at that institution he worked  from the second year  as a histology technician in the Department of Pathology. It was here that Hilton A. Smith  who was his professor of pathology  established Carl’s love of veterinary pathology and where the two began a professional relationship to last the rest of their lives. Upon his graduation from veterinary school with highest honors in 1935  Carl entered the U.S. Army for a distinguished career in the Veterinary Corps for 25 years. While serving at the Presidio at Monterey  Calif.  Carl published his first article  “Modified horseshoeing for road marches ” following the ceremonies for the grand opening of the Golden Gate Bridge. Apparently that was the last time horses were welcome at the Golden Gate Bridge.In 1938 and 1939 Carl served at the Army Veterinary School and then from 1939 to 1946 Carl served at the U.S. Army Veterinary Research Laboratory at Front Royal  Virginia. Here  as the officer in charge of research he conducted studies on equine influenza (equine viral rhinopneumonitis)  equine periodic opthalmia and equine viral arteritis. While stationed in Virginia  Carl sought consultation with the then Army Medical Museum (AMM)  later the Army Institute of Pathology and then the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Here he established many professional relationships with medical pathologists including James E. Ash with whom he published on periodic ophthalmia. Ash  who was the Director of the AMM  was influenced by Carl’s desire that the AMM establish a registry of veterinary pathology. The fact that Dr. Ash was married to the daughter of Dr. Denny Udall a professor of medicine at the New York Veterinary College at Cornell University also influenced his interest. The registry of veterinary pathology came into being in 1943. In 1946  after the end of World War II  Carl was appointed chief of the veterinary division and Registrar of the Registry of Veterinary Pathology of the AMM.While at the AMM Carl pursued his vision for a college of veterinary pathologists. Working with William H. Feldman  who had been appointed a consultant to the AMM by Dr. Ash  Carl’s tireless energy and efforts gained approval of the American Veterinary Medical Association for the establishment of a specialty group. Following a meeting of 15 veterinary pathologists in Chicago in 1948  the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) was born with 42 charter members. Carl served as the ACVP’s first secretary-treasurer with William Feldman as the first president. He remained secretary-treasurer through 1950 and again from 1954 through 1960 and served as president in 1963. Carl wrote the ACVP constitution and in 1951 arranged the first examination.Dr. Jones remained at the AMM until 1950 when he was stationed to West Germany to serve as Chief of the Veterinary Department of the Fourth Medical Field Laboratory. While in West Germany  he was the first American to be elected to their veterinary pathology association. Following his tour of duty in West Germany  he returned to the United States to once again serve as Chief of the veterinary division at the AFIP from 1953 to 1957. In 1954 Dr. Jones with C.A. Gleiser published the classic text “Veterinary Necropsy Procedures.” Also during the 1950’s Carl began work with his former mentor  Hilton Smith  in writing a textbook of veterinary pathology. This was first published in 1957 and immediately became the standard textbook for veterinary pathology in schools of veterinary medicine and for those aspiring young pathologists preparing for the ACPV examination.Dr. Jones retired from the Army as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1957. His career in the Army was distinguished with many awards  including the Hoskins Medal  the Legions of Merit and the Certificate of Merit from the AFIP. In 1957 he began a new career as director of pathology at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital and as assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School. He revitalized the Department of Pathology at Angell and obtained funding for an additional floor added to the hospital devoted to the Department. Through Harvard Medical School’s Department of Pathology  he established a National Institutes of Health supported training program in veterinary pathology. This program  still in existence at the School’s New England Primate Research Center  is the longest running National Institutes of Health training program supported by the Division of Research Resources. At HMS and Angell he not only concentrated on diseases of dogs and cats  he continued his interest in diseases of laboratory animals that he began while at the AFIP. In 1953 he had established the first course on diseases of laboratory animals at the AFIP which became an instant success and continues to this day. In 1963 he was promoted to Associate Professor of Pathology.In 1967 Carl left the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital to assume a full time position at the New England Regional Primate Research Center in Southboro  Mass.  an integral component of Harvard Medical School. Here he was named as associate director and promoted to professor of pathology. With the death of Hilton Smith  Dr. Jones was joined by Dr. Ronald D. Hunt in preparing three more editions of the textbook “Veterinary Pathology.” In 1978 Dr. Jones joined Kurt Benirschke and F.M. Garner in editing a two-volume set on “Pathology of Laboratory Animals.” In the 1980’s Dr. Jones was invited by the International Life Science Institute to participate with Dr. Ulrich Mohr  a medical pathologist in Hanover  Germany  to organize a series of short courses on pathology of laboratory animals with each course devoted to a body system or species. These were predominantly held in Hanover  Germany; but also in Japan and the United States. Each course resulted in a monograph edited by T.C. Jones  U. Mohr and R.D. Hunt.After Carl’s wife  Dorotha Anne Bratt  died he left Harvard and New England and moved to Washington D.C. in 1994. Here he worked on the sixth edition of “Veterinary Pathology” which was published in 1996. He ultimately moved to Santa Fe  N.M. with his close friend and partner Joyce Blalock.Dr. Jones’ unique and invaluable abilities have been sought by countless institutions throughout his career. A list of a few of his past affiliations and honors include: member of the Graduate Council  George Washington University; research associate in pathology  Cancer Research Institute  New England Deaconess Hospital; alumnus of the year (1963) College of Veterinary Medicine  Washington State University; chairman  Council of Research  American Veterinary Medical Association; consultant to the National Institutes of Health  Division of General Medical Sciences  and National Cancer Institute; consultant and member of the Scientific Advisory Board  AFIP; member  Committee of Animal Health of the Agricultural Board of the National Academy of Sciences; consultant in pathology to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; associate editor  Pathologia Veterinaria; chairman  advisory board of Veterinary Specialties  American Veterinary Medical Association; consultant  West Roxbury and Providence Veterans Administration Hospital; consultant on Comparative Pathology  World Health Organization; and member  subcommittee of Comparative Pathology  National Academy of Sciences. A most distinguished honor was his election as president of the International Academy of Pathology. In 1971 he was awarded an honorary doctor of science from the Ohio State University and he was named a distinguished member of the ACVP.Dr. Jones leaves his son Don Carl Jones of Madison  Wis.; his daughters Sylvia Garfield of West Lebanon  N.H. and Ann L. Willis of Heights Town  N.J. and eight grandchildren  Todd Jones  Karin Myers  Eric Jones  Andrew Garfield  James Garfield  Avery Willis  Kingsley Willis and Goreleigh Willis.Respectfully submitted Ronald D.

Harvard Business School Professor Jesse W. Markham dies at 93,Former Harvard Business School (HBS) Professor Jesse W. Markham  an economist whose work focused on price theory and industrial organization  died in his sleep on June 21 in Nashua  N.H.  at an assisted-living home. He was 93.By the time he joined the HBS faculty in 1968 from Princeton University  where he had been professor of economics  Markham was a well-known proponent of the “rule of reason” to determine whether a merger should pass muster under federal antitrust laws. “Unlike those who advocated following arbitrary guidelines regarding industry concentration and market share ” he said in a 1993 interview at the School  “I preferred to look at each case on its own merits.”A major study Markham undertook at HBS supported that point of view. Published in 1973  Conglomerate Enterprise and Public Policy was a detailed examination of more than 200 large corporations that had diversified during the merger mania of the 1960s. Although companies such as Textron  Gulf & Western  and International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) were acquiring a mixture of other firms during that decade  Markham found no enhancement of “market power” in any of the diverse industries in which these conglomerates operated.It was the opportunity to deal with these kinds of problems that led Markham to accept Dean George P. Baker’s invitation to teach and do research at Harvard Business School. “I came here because the theories on which public policy was being built in economics didn’t square with the realities of the marketplace ” he once observed. “I wanted to work in an environment where my colleagues  students  and contacts were close to managerial decision making.”Appropriately  Markham’s first classroom assignment at HBS was in the School’s Advanced Management Program (AMP)  where he taught a survey of international trade problems and public policies affecting American business. In the M.B.A. program  he offered a second-year elective called “Marketing and Public Policy ” and from 1978 to 1982 he served as head of “Creative Marketing Strategies ” a field study course that put student teams to work on issues facing actual clients.Markham was born in Sharps  Va.  on April 16  1916. He traced his interest in economics to his sophomore year at the University of Richmond  where he won praise from a professor for his work in an introductory class. Encouraged to continue his studies in the field  he opted to major in economics rather than engineering. Excelling in the classroom and on the baseball diamond  he received his bachelor’s degree in 1941 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He began graduate school in economics that fall at Johns Hopkins University.When a fellowship enabled him to spend part of the year doing research in Boston  Markham sat in on some courses offered by the Harvard Economics Department. Although World War II interrupted his education in 1942  his experience in Cambridge made a lasting impression. After three years as an officer in the U.S. Navy  where he saw combat as a gunnery officer on a heavy cruiser  he decided to return to Harvard to resume his academic career. He earned a master’s degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. two years later.Markham’s first faculty appointment was at Vanderbilt University. In 1953  however  as he was about to take a position at Princeton  the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) selected him to be its chief economist. “At a time when Congress had passed an act putting arbitrary constraints on corporate mergers ” Markham said  “the Eisenhower administration saw me as a voice in favor of a standard of workable  as opposed to perfect  competition. I could advocate the benefits of letting certain firms work together to foster innovation  which buyers value just as much as temporary price advantages — the traditional yardstick of competitiveness.”Leaving the FTC in 1955  Markham finally took his place at Princeton  where he taught for more than a decade  except for stints as a visiting professor in the Harvard Economics Department and at HBS. Three years after heeding Baker’s call to stay at Harvard permanently in 1968  Markham was named the School’s Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration. He retired from the active faculty in 1982  but went on to teach for two years at Emory University. He was also a member of the Harvard Extension School faculty for many years. “I have always been energized by my work with students ” he explained.Markham authored 12 scholarly books and more than 150 articles. In 1994  Harvard Business School honored him with a Distinguished Service Award. The citation he received read in part: “Honored scholar and master of merger policy  you have been trusted by professors and presidents to analyze the pros and cons of corporate combinations. … Your love of teaching has been legend  your admirers legion  and your publishing prolific. Never a retiring sort  you have been a rich resource to all of Harvard  a steady guide in the constant search for VERITAS.”Markham is survived by his wife of 65 years  the former Penelope Anton; three children  Elizabeth (Betsy) McLean of Merrimack  N.H.  John James Emmanuel II of Boston  and Jesse William Jr. of San Francisco; a niece  Penny Boling of Manchester-by-the-Sea  Mass.; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
HSPH’s Hanna Machlup Hastings dies at 78,Hanna Hastings  former House master and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) administrator  died on June 15 at the age of 78. She suffered from an advanced stage of Parkinson’s disease.Her husband  J. Woodland “Woody” Hastings  is the Paul C. Mangelsdorf Professor of Natural Sciences in Harvard’s Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.Hastings  the daughter of Mitzi and Fritz Machlup  was born in 1930 in Vienna  Austria. In 1935  her family emigrated to the United States  and Hastings was later educated at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington  D.C.  and Swarthmore College. After graduate work at Johns Hopkins University  she earned advanced degrees from the University of Illinois  Boston College  and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Hanna and Woody were married in the early 1950s and had four children.The two were House masters at North (now Pforzheimer) House for 20 years  stepping down in 1996. During that time Hastings was director of student affairs at HSPH and a member of the Harvard Medical School Admissions Committee.Hastings  an avid exerciser  had a passion for cycling  skiing  and swimming. Fluent in German and French  she engaged in music  theater  art  and politics  and traveled widely.A memorial service is planned for the fall at Pforzheimer House.
I. (Israel) David Todres,(Israel) David Todres  Professor of Paediatrics (Anaesthesia) at Harvard Medical School  died at his home of lymphoma on Sept. 26  2008. He was 73.Born in South Africa where his parents immigrated from Lithuania  David obtained his undergraduate and medical school education at the University of Cape Town. As a medical student in the late 1950’s  he worked with a pioneering pediatrician and anesthesiologist who were treating neonatal tetanus in babies with tracheostomy and curare  which was one of the first successful uses of mechanical ventilation in a series of neonates. After his postgraduate training  largely in pediatrics  he spent several years in England in anesthesiology  first at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford including in its adult intensive care unit and then at the Hospital for Sick Children in London. After briefly returning to Cape Town to serve as a Consultant in Pediatrics and Anesthesia  he moved to Montefiore Hospital in New York City in 1969 and became the Director of both pediatric anesthesia and the medical-surgical intensive care unit and an Associate Professor of Anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.In 1971 he relocated to Boston to become one of the co-founders of the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). It was a daring thing to do since the MGH at that time had no obstetrical service and only a small pediatric service. The impetus was that the MGH Department of Anesthesia had a few years earlier established the first respiratory care unit in the country  helping demonstrate the enormous benefit of intensive care for adults. It certainly seemed appropriate to extend this concept to infants and children  and David helped develop at the MGH one of the early and premier intensive care units for children in the world. He was deeply involved in all aspects of patient care and was widely known as a master clinician and teacher. In recognition  he soon was appointed the units’ Director and served in that role for the next twenty years.David developed a special interest and expertise in bioethics because of the complex problems that were becoming apparent as increasing technologic innovations were used to treat younger  smaller and sicker children who were surviving illnesses that had previously been fatal. Calm under all circumstances  his wise and reasoned approach to sick patients went well beyond invasive catheters  laboratory values  and drug lists and always addressed the cultural values of the family. He was a deeply spiritual man  knowledgeable in his Jewish faith as well as other faiths  for which he had profound respect. He incorporated this into his approach to medicine and  through the example of his own gentle manner and everyday humility  he taught residents how to communicate with patients and their families in the most trying of circumstances. Rather than focus on the negative  David approached life with unending optimism whether dealing with critically ill children or his own  ultimately fatal  illness which included multiple rounds of chemotherapy  radiation and a stem cell transplant. He established a pediatric-oriented bioethics program at the MGH and was an active participant in the bioethics program at Harvard Medical School. Until the time of his death  he served as the Chief of the Ethics Unit of the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children.David was board-certified in pediatrics  neonatology  anesthesiology  and critical care medicine and was a Fellow of the Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of England. He was the author of more than 150 original reports and review articles. In addition  he was one of the co-authors of the book “A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children” now in its 4th edition and another  “Critical Care of Infants and Children.” In the later stages of his career he devoted increasing time to the Program in Medical Education at Harvard Medical School where he directed the Steering Committee for the Comprehensive Examination (OSCE) for fourth-year medical students. He served on numerous national committees including the Task Force of the American Heart Association for Advanced Pediatric Life Support and the Committee on Bioethics of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. He received widespread recognition in the form of many prestigious awards  including the first Distinguished Career Award from the Critical Care Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Grenvik Family Award for Ethics in Critical Care Medicine as well as the Presidential Citation from the Society of Critical Care Medicine.Finally  David was well versed in classic literature and loved the arts whether visiting museums or dabbling in painting and sculpture. His relationships with trainees at all levels revealed his unusual warmth  from resident interviews  to clinical rounds  to the book group he established to explore medicine  art and culture. His lectures were replete with deep knowledge and delivered with so much enthusiasm it was impossible not to get interested in the topic. With his incomparable South African accent  shock of curly gray hair  and wonderful smile  he made an indelible impression on all who had the great pleasure of getting to know this most kind and gentle man. He is survived by his wife of nearly twenty years  Judith Sharlin  and their son Hillel  of Waban  MA; three children from a prior marriage (Jonathan of Atlanta  GA  Nadia of Readsboro  VT and Rachelle and her son  John Jeremiah of Malden  MA)  and his brother  Hymie of Perth  Australia. A memorial lectureship in pediatric medical ethics has been established at the MGH in his honor.Mark Rockoff  M.D. (Chair)Ronald Arky  M.D.John Downes  M.D.Michael Epstein  M.D.Edward Lowenstein  M.D.Jonathan Todres  J.D.Robert Truog  M.D.
Jack H. Mendelson,Jack H. Mendelson  M.D.  Professor of Psychiatry (Neuroscience) at Harvard Medical School and Co-Director of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center at McLean Hospital died on August 15  2007  after a brief illness; he was 77 years old. Jack devoted his research career to clinical  behavioral  and biological studies of alcoholism and drug abuse. He was a true titan of the field. After undergraduate training at the Johns Hopkins University  Jack received his medical degree from the University of Maryland  then did an internship at Boston City Hospital and a psychiatry residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was the first Chief of the National Center for Prevention and Control of Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health  then Chief of Psychiatry at Boston City Hospital  Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School  and founder and co-director (with his colleague and beloved wife  Nancy Mello  Ph.D.) of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center at McLean Hospital. He made nearly 500 contributions to the scientific literature. In his case  quantity was matched by quality; he published papers in Science  Nature  and the New England Journal of Medicine  and won numerous awards  among them the Founders Award of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry  the Hofheimer Prize of the American Psychiatric Association  and  with Nancy Mello  the Jellinek Memorial Award for Research on Alcoholism  the Distinguished Research Award of the Research Society on Alcoholism  and the Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award for Innovative Research on Drug Abuse from the College on Problems of Drug Dependence. The McLean Hospital has established an annual research award for excellence in behavioral and biological research on substance abuse in Jack’s honor. The National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse of the NIH has established a memorial lectureship to honor Jack  which indicates the level of esteem in which he is held.As a teacher  Jack was extremely skilled in making complex concepts understandable to students  trainees  and colleagues in psychiatry and other medical specialties. In so doing  he not only broadened their perspective on the clinical and scientific complexity of substance use disorders  but also placed these disorders firmly within the scope of work of all practicing physicians. For postdoctoral students and young physicians with a more enduring interest in alcohol and drug abuse research  Jack was an enthusiastic mentor  generously sharing data  giving them an opportunity to write up their findings  reviewing their work with a critical scientific eye  and encouraging their efforts with unflagging optimism. Many went on to successful academic careers of their own  fortified by the solid grounding in research methodology and the untiring support they received as fellows and junior faculty members in the laboratories that  for almost four decades  have remained on the cutting edge of research in this field.To appreciate the impact of Jack’s work on the field of addiction research  it is useful to consider how alcoholism and addiction were viewed before Jack conducted his landmark studies. For example  alcoholism was grouped in the diagnostic nomenclature with personality disorders  and was seen as a symptom of some underlying deep-seated psychological problem rather than a disease in its own right. Jack’s critical research  in which he observed alcoholics in the act of drinking  began to change all of that. He demonstrated through rigorous human laboratory studies that alcoholic drinking caused dysphoria and other psychiatric symptoms  and was not merely a result of other problems. He clearly demonstrated the degree of suffering that alcoholics experience  and sensitized the field to appreciate that. This led to the beginning of more integration of alcoholism and its treatment into mainstream medicine  as well as a more empathic rather than judgmental view of individuals with alcohol dependence.Jack had a similar view of opioid dependence  and was involved in some of the groundbreaking work on the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine  demonstrating its potential therapeutic value in the treatment of heroin addiction. Twenty years later  buprenorphine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence  representing the first time that opioid agonist treatment could be prescribed by physicians as part of general medical practice. Jack was also involved in the early studies of the opioid antagonist naltrexone  which is an effective treatment both in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol dependence. These are just a few of the highlights of Jack’s research career.As impressive as the actual research discoveries that Jack Mendelson made was the way that he accomplished them. Jack realized that a multiplicity of factors influenced the development  clinical course  and response to treatment of substance abuse and dependence. He also recognized that greater scientific understanding was and still is an essential precursor to eradicating the stigma associated with these disorders and for developing effective  evidence-based treatment approaches. Along with several generations of scientific colleagues and students  Jack brought innovation and scientific rigor to a study of the problems of substance use and dependence. His work shed light on the complex interplay between brain mechanisms and behavior in the development of these clinically complex problems. He and Nancy were among the first to explore the role of neuroendocrine factors in the development of substance dependence. Key to his success was an appreciation of the need to approach this complex set of disorders from a variety of perspectives  and he encouraged innovative scientists in a variety of fields to join his efforts. Thus  the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center has over the years included psychiatrists  psychologists  sociologists  anthropologists  pharmacologists  chemists  biochemists  radiologists  obstetricians  and endocrinologists. By including scientists from a wide variety of theoretical perspectives  Jack was able to achieve exciting discoveries and help elucidate the nature of this group of disorders.It is common  when describing someone who has passed on  to say that he loved life. But Jack Mendelson really loved life  and it showed. His devotion to Nancy  his children  and grandchildren  was obvious  and he loved to have fun. He traveled frequently  often to exotic locations. He loved giving hotel and restaurant recommendations  and he was never wrong about these. He was an avid photographer  gardener  and cook. Jack enjoyed entertaining his staff at his and Nancy’s home in Rockport. They even provided buckets and shovels for the young children who would come to their annual summer parties – a very thoughtful touch.No tribute to Jack  however  would be complete without mentioning his jokes. Jack had an endless store of wonderful stories and an even larger collection of jokes. Many of his jokes were brilliant  and many were  as he would admit  awful  usually based on bad puns that would elicit simultaneous groans and laughter. But the pleasure was less about the jokes than about the joke-telling  and Jack appeared to enjoy telling the bad jokes as much (or more) than the good ones. There was a rhythm to the joke-telling; as the punch line approached  he would often lean forward a bit and speak a little more softly  as if the listeners were about to be let in on an important secret. Then the punchline was delivered with a twinkle in his eye. That was classic Jack Mendelson. He was indeed both a titan and a mensch. We will miss him.Submitted byRoger Weiss  M.D.  ChairBruce Cohen  M.D.  Ph.D.Shelly Greenfield  M.D.  M.P.H.Roger Meyer  M.D.Steven Mirin  M.D.
Donald James Martino,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences October 21  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Donald Martino was one of the leading American composers of the twentieth century. Born in Plainfield  New Jersey  he began lessons on the clarinet and other wind instruments at the age of nine  and he remained a clarinetist all his life  even as he grew to be a many-sided musician  teacher  and  above all  composer of significant instrumental and vocal works. After attending Syracuse University  he did his graduate work at Princeton in the 1950s  where he studied with Roger Sessions and Milton Babbitt. Thereafter he taught at Princeton  Yale  the New England Conservatory of Music (where he was chairman of the Composition Department from 1969 to 1980)  Brandeis University  and finally at Harvard  where he was the Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music from 1983 until his retirement ten years later. He was active as a guest lecturer  and was Composer-in-Residence at Tanglewood  the Composers Conference  the Yale Summer School of Music  the Pontino Festival in Italy  the Atlantic Center for the Arts  the Ernest Bloch Festival  and the Festival Internacional de Música de Morelia  Mexico. His many commissions came from  among others  the Paderewski Fund; the Fromm  Naumburg  Koussevitzky  and Coolidge Foundations; and from the Chicago  Boston and San Francisco Symphonies  along with other performing organizations.In Florence  where he lived from 1954 to 1956 on a Fulbright scholarship  Martino studied with the eminent Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola  and the blend of lyricism and rigor that Dallapiccola instilled into his own music may have formed a partial model for the direction of Martino’s mature works  which blend these features in a musical language of high originality and expressivity. In an interview for his sixtieth birthday  Martino offered the view that  in utilizing the full resources of the chromatic scale  in his own highly personal adaptation of the so-called “twelve-tone system ” he wanted to write music that “would sing and think  too.” Despite frequent misunderstandings by critics and others of where he stood as a composer  he asked that if future listeners “look and listen to my music  they will judge that it’s really pretty old-fashioned and traditional stuff… I used to bridle at that realization but I’ve come to view it tenderly of late. When I listen to a Brahms Intermezzo or his C Minor Piano Quartet I don’t analyze it  I sit and weep. That’s what I’d like my audience to do…”Having established a significant profile through works such as Pianississimo and his piano masterpiece Fantasies and Impromptus  the Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra  Paradiso Choruses and the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra  Martino composed Notturno for an ensemble of six players for which he was awarded the 1974 Pulitzer Prize. One critic described the work as “nocturnal theater of the soul” and Martino expressed his pleasure “with that poetic description.”Martino’s musical appetite was voracious and democratic. In his early teens  he studied with the local bandmaster  an Italian immigrant  who awakened his love for Italian opera and bequeathed to the composer a large collection of Italian opera transcriptions from the late nineteenth century. Many decades later  these transcriptions fired Martino’s imagination and he made his own arrangements of them  whose objective  in Martino’s words  “has not been to stubbornly confirm the authenticity of the music as much as it has been to recreate the authenticity of my youthful experience.” Jazz also ran in his veins. One of his Plainfield  New Jersey  acquaintances was the great jazz pianist/composer Bill Evans; they occasionally played music together in the early 1950s. Recently-heard recordings of the fourteen-year-old Martino playing jazz clarinet caused his lifelong friend Gunther Schuller to remark “at fourteen he played better than Artie Shaw and I speak with authority.”The list of Martino’s students is long  and includes many of the most prominent names in American composition today. His teaching encompassed not only profound insights into the music of Schoenberg  Berg  Beethoven  and Brahms  but also a single-minded insistence on the same high levels of musical craftsmanship that he observed in his own composition. This craftsmanship had to start at the most basic level of harmony and instrumentation; one of the pedagogical tools he developed for his own students  a comparative edition of 178 chorale harmonizations by J. S. Bach  is still used by many today  as is his “Stringograph ” which he invented to help non-string players compose for the violin  viola  and cello.Dissatisfied with the publishing world for new music  Martino  together with his wife  Lora  founded his own company  Dantalian  Inc.  to produce  promote  and distribute his music. By the way  “Dantalian” has nothing to do with the words “Dante” or “Italian ” but refers to a medieval talisman that Martino came across in the 1960s. He was a major force in the world of new music for many years  a devoted teacher and colleague  and a wholly committed composer. His music is not easy listening because he would not give in to facile productivity  but rather reflects his need to go to deeper levels and to write music that was strong enough to last. His music stands  and will stand  for a very long time as among the most expressive and memorable of our time  and not only by American composers.Martino was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His many awards include two Fulbright scholarships; three Guggenheim awards; grants from the Massachusetts Arts Council  the National Institute of Arts and Letters  and the National Endowment for the Arts; the Brandeis Creative Arts Citation in Music; First Prize in the 1985 Kennedy Center Friedheim Competition for his String Quartet (1983)  and most recently  the Boston Symphony’s Mark M. Horblit Award. He died of cardiac arrest following an attack of hyperglycemia off the coast of Antigua while on a Caribbean cruise  and is survived by his wife  Lora Martino; a daughter  Anna Maria  of Branford  Connecticut; and a son  Christopher  of Boston.Respectfully submitted Lewis LockwoodJohn StewartAnne C.

Shukri F. Khuri,Dr. Shukri F. Khuri passed away peacefully at the age of 65  surrounded by family and friends  on September 26  2008  at his Westwood home  after courageously battling brain cancer for more than eighteen months. A gifted and spirited surgeon and researcher  his absolute love for life enabled him to achieve remarkable professional success and effectively pursue his passions for family  friends and various interests.Born in Jerusalem  Dr. Khuri fled with his parents to Syria and then to Beirut  Lebanon. He later attended the American University of Beirut (AUB)  graduating with distinction from college and medical school. In addition to excelling academically  he had a passion for the arts and was a producer of student musicals. The theatre is where he met Randa Domian  who later became his wife  lifelong supporter and best friend.He completed his surgical residency at the AUB hospital in Beirut  training in research at Johns Hopkins Hospital  and cardiac surgery at the Mayo Clinic. He was recruited in 1976 to the West Roxbury Veteran’s Administration (VA) surgical service  where he soon expanded the surgical research laboratory and became a major contributor in the field of cardiac surgery. Two years later  he ascended to the role of chief of cardiac surgery  and in 1984  became chief of surgery for the next twenty years. Under his leadership the cardiac surgery program became the largest in the VA system and the first program in any specialty to be designated a program of excellence by the Department of Veterans Affairs.The affiliation of the West Roxbury VA and Harvard University was one of the first of its kind between a university and a VA hospital. This affiliation strengthened over the years  and when Shukri became chief of surgery  Dr. John Mannick  then chairman of surgery at the Brigham and Women’s hospital  appointed him vice-chairman of the department  a position he maintained under the tenure of Dr. Michael Zinner. In 1987 Shukri rose to the rank of Professor of surgery at HMS.Dr. Khuri was a master clinician  an inspiring teacher and mentor  a competent administrator and a prolific researcher and innovator. He was the consummate surgeon-scientist. The scope of his research interests was limitless  and his ability to attract very competent professionals from other disciplines to work harmoniously with him was exemplary.With Dr Bob Kloner  then a cardiology fellow assigned by Dr. Eugene Braunwald to work in Shukri’s laboratory  he developed the pH meter and showed that it could be used to monitor a reduction in pH as the first marker of myocardial ischemia. With Dr. Robert Valeri of the Naval Research Laboratory  he identified platelet dysfunction during cardiopulmonary bypass. With Dr. Joanne Ingwall at Harvard and Dr. Leo Nuringer at MIT  using nuclear magnetic spectroscopy  he studied changes in high-energy phosphates during myocardial ischemia. With his colleagues in the surgical research laboratory and Helmant Thatte PhD  he developed the GALA solution to preserve the endothelium of the saphenous vein before its use in coronary bypass  and the LAZARUS solution to resuscitate and preserve the donor heart before transplantation.Dr. Khuri was a major contributor to the surgical package in DHCP (Decentralized Hospital Computer Program) which is now the most comprehensive electronic medical records system in the world. He also installed the first automated data management system in a surgical intensive care unit in the VA and in New England.Shukri’s crowning achievement came in 1994. Under his guidance as co-founder and chair  and with a large multidisciplinary team of collaborators including Dr. Jennifer Daly  now at Partners Health Care  the landmark NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Project) became a reality within the VA. This project was the first validated  outcome-based  risk adjusted  and peer controlled program for the measurement and improvement of the quality of surgical care. The NSQIP was adopted by the American College of Surgeons in 2001  and has now extended to over 215 hospitals in the private sector. Since its inception the 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity within the VA have dropped by 47% and 43% respectively.Shukri also had a loving family and a beautiful home. With Randa  his two daughters and son  they regularly hosted delicious dinners and social events for friends  colleagues  neighbors and guests. He was senior warden in his church  and with Randa  created a chapel devoted to peace in the Holy Land. He worked closely with his alma mater and served as president of the New England AUB Alumni Association. He worked ardently with many local groups to create and sustain dialogue between Israelis  Palestinians  and Jewish and Arab Americans to promote peace and justice throughout the world and especially in the Middle East.He published over 380 peer reviewed articles  was a reviewer for several scientific journals  and served on the editorial board of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. He belonged to many professional organizations and served as president for three years of the Massachusetts Affiliate of the American Heart Association  and as vice-president of the American Surgical Association in 2005-2006.He was the recipient of numerous prestigious honors and awards  all richly deserved  including the Paul Dudley White award of the American Heart Association  the 1998 Frank Brown Berry Prize  honoring an outstanding physician in the federal healthcare system  and posthumously  the Joint Commission’s Ernest Amory Codman Award for outstanding contributions by an individual in performance measurement.Dr. Khuri’s scope of interests and activities was no less remarkable than his research. He was at ease discussing history  politics  philosophy  religion  music  theatre  arts  movies  and sports- truly a man for all seasons.His courage  optimism  love of life and love of his work were vividly on display during his difficult battle with his illness. Even during radiation and chemotherapy treatments  he obsessed over his work  his plans for tomorrow and his next research project  while keeping his good humor  cheering his family and enjoying the music he loved. He was truly a profile in courage.He was a humble man who  inspired by his deep Christian faith  was always kind and considerate with his colleagues and subordinates  yet relentless in his pursuit of excellence  be it in photography  carpentry  or peace and justice for all his fellow human beings. His love for the beauty of life was infectious  and he was simply a wonderful person to be around. He was a brilliant researcher  yet a role model husband  father  grandfather  and mentor to over sixty residents and fellows. He cherished his work  but  more so  family and friendships as his extended loving family  and his many loyal friends and admirers will attest.Dr. Khuri’s initiatives and achievements improved the surgical service  the Boston VA medical center  the Department of Veterans Affairs  and American surgery. For all of his contributions and for Shukri the man  the memory of his work and his life will remain indelible.Dr. John MannickDr. Michael ZinnerDr. Joseph LoscalzoDr. Kamal ItaniDr. Ernest Barsamian  Chairperson
Dimitri Hadzi,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences February 10  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.All of us here know at least one sculpture by Dimitri Hadzi — if not the towering Thermopylae at Government Center plaza  then Omphalos in Harvard Square. For Dimitri the Greek titles weren’t unusual. He was from a recently immigrated Greek-American family and took pleasure in saying “I’m a Greek and Greeks have to carve.” And carve he did  as well as cast—scores of major works  ranging in scale from the monumental to the miniature  many in public places  many in private collections and museums.Dimitri Hadzi was born in 1921 in New York City. As a child he was sent to a Greek after-school program  where he received instruction in Greek language  mythology  history  and theater. His artistic ability won him a drawing prize and his strength in math and science gained him admission to Brooklyn Technical High School. Upon graduating he worked as a chemist by day while continuing to study chemistry by night. On July 4  1942  he enlisted in the Army Air Force and served in the South Pacific  where an officer encouraged his efforts at drawing. After the war  he returned to New York  decided to turn away from chemistry  and became a student of painting and sculpture at Cooper Union. At the age of 29  a Fulbright Scholarship took him to Athens where he studied the history of Greco-Roman sculpture while learning the technical demands of carving in stone. The GI Bill subsequently allowed him to continue his studies in Rome  where he set up his first studio. While there he married the art historian and archeologist Martha Leeb and had two children  Cristina and Stephen.Within a few short years Dimitri’s work in bronze was shown at the Museum of Modern Art. Along with Louise Nevelson he represented the U.S. in sculpture at the 1962 Venice Biennale. A flood of commissions and exhibitions followed  including one-man shows in New York and Rome. The Whitney  Guggenheim  Hirshhorn  and Cleveland museums purchased his work. Princeton  MIT  and Yale acquired and installed major pieces  Lincoln Center commissioned K458 The Hunt  and the Sun Life Insurance Company in Baltimore commissioned Helios  a suspended piece in bronze. In 1968 a retrospective was mounted at Temple University of Dimitri’s fifteen years in Rome. More gallery shows ensued  as did a residency at Dartmouth  the completion of Arcturus  a 25-foot bronze for the plaza of the Reserve Bank in Minneapolis  and Willamette River Oracle in Eugene  Oregon  Dimitri’s first monumental work in stone.In 1975 Dimitri left Rome to come to Harvard  soon becoming our first tenured professor in the studio arts. As a teacher  he laid out a demanding curriculum in both sculpture and printmaking  emphasizing drawing and modeling from the figure  always encouraging his students to follow their own paths of aesthetic discovery. He occupied the fifth-floor studio of the Carpenter Center  which Corbusier had designed for our senior artist  filling it  as well as his East Cambridge studio  with projects in all stages of exploration and completion. Following his divorce  a friendship blossomed with the charming and urbane Assistant for Exhibitions at the Carpenter Center  Cynthia von Thuna  and in June 1985  the two were married.In both of Dimitri’s studios he worked in stone and wood  he modeled  he cast works in bronze  he etched  he drew. His teaching seemed to spur his own achievements. He created the large-scale River Legend for the Federal Office Building in Portland  Bishop’s Triad for One Dallas Center  and Propylaea  a huge granite fountain in Toledo. In 1983 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters  and shortly after  completed the heroic sculptures in Harvard Square and Copley Place and others for Appleton  Wisconsin and Carleton College. This work  as with everything he created  was marked by a meticulous craftsmanship  a mastery of materials that drew on his knowledge of chemistry and his later studies of geology  and a sensitivity to the subtleties of color rooted in his early work as a painter.Retirement from teaching in 1989 did nothing to diminish Dimitri’s productivity. He created major pieces for San Francisco and Birmingham  Alabama  mounted one-man shows in New York  Tokyo  Houston  Los Angeles  and Chicago  and collaborated with his friend Seamus Heaney on an illustrated book of poems  Keeping Going. In the winter of 2006 the Kouros Gallery in New York organized an exhibition entitled Dimitri Hadzi at 85  but Dimitri was too ill to attend. He died shortly afterward on April 16  2006.Dimitri was a thoroughgoing modernist. At the same  the entire history of western sculpture from Praxiteles to David Smith informed his work. As with the best of his contemporaries  his sculptures evoked the past while insistently probing its connection to the present. A sustained dialogue between figuration and abstraction energized them. His forceful yet sophisticated three-dimensional compositions were born from an intuitive understanding of effects that can be called forth by the interaction in space of forms  colors  and textures.Dimitri chose Rome  with its myriad connections to antiquity  as the place to form himself and explore his identity as an artist. When  in the “eternal city ” he created bronze doors for its Anglican church  he across the centuries joined the venerable guild of artists who  like Lorenzo Ghiberti in Florence  strove to give dignity to the place of entry into a sanctuary. His artistic life was one of unceasing invention and productivity  enriched by friendships with his most eminent artistic contemporaries. He was an artist of enormous ambition and achievement  and together with his forebears  will be remembered in the bronze and stone he shaped for the ages.Respectfully submitted Christopher KillipEduard SeklerAlfred Guzzetti  Chair

Dean Tosteson dies at age 84,Daniel C. Tosteson  the Caroline Shields Walker Distinguished Professor of Cell Biology  who served an extraordinary two decades as dean of Harvard Medical School  from 1977 to 1997  died peacefully on May 27 after a long illness. He was 84 years old.“He is a Harvard legend whose imprint on the university  and on medical education in particular  will be evident for many years to come ” said President Drew Faust.“Daniel Tosteson was a towering figure in the modern history of Harvard Medical School ” said Jeffrey S. Flier  the Medical School’s current dean. “His vision and leadership brought major and enduring changes in HMS education  research  and the School’s relationship to the world. Since I assumed leadership of the School  I met with him many times  and despite his increasing disability  his passion for education  research and the Medical School never waned. He will be sorely missed.”By all accounts  Tosteson was an exceptional leader. His greatest legacy is the New Pathway  a radical restructuring of medical education launched in 1985 that combined several innovations being tested separately at other medical schools.Part of Tosteson’s rationale for the New Pathway was his belief that medical students would learn better if they were responsible for their own learning. In lieu of learning primarily through lectures and texts  Harvard medical students began studying cases that guide them toward acquiring the core knowledge of medicine through their own efforts. In small groups  they analyze each case  seeking the information they need. They thereby cultivate skills and attitudes to decode unfamiliar medical situations and scientific understanding to deal with fields in which progress keeps accelerating.Harvard was not the first medical school to institute problem-based learning  but its program was comprehensive and has since been emulated by medical schools all over the United States  as well as abroad.“Dan’s clear objective was to prepare students to be lifelong learners as our knowledge of biomedical science expanded ” said S. James Adelstein  the Paul C. Cabot distinguished professor of medical biophysics at HMS  who served as executive dean for academic programs during most of Tosteson’s tenure. “He felt it was important to work not only on the knowledge base  but also on the attitudinal base  establishing attitudes toward learning and toward patients.”Besides revolutionizing teaching  Tosteson kept the content of the curriculum more than current by anticipating future scientific developments. He was one of the first to foresee the revolution in molecular biology  and he positioned Harvard to move forward accordingly.In 1980  he established the Department of Genetics  one of the first in the nation  “and reorganized the departmental structure on the School’s Boston Quadrangle  strengthening existing departments and creating the new Department of Cell Biology and that of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology ” saidPhilip Leder  the John Emory Andrus professor of genetics and former chair of the Genetics Department. In addition  while many others were debating the role of functional genomics  Tosteson implemented a plan to develop this nascent field  which investigates the function of genes in the living organism.Tosteson also invested in graduate education. He expanded the size of the PhD program and established the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program  which enables students to pursue doctoral work with faculty members in one of five basic science departments at HMS or in its 17 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.In addition  he expanded HMS’s scope beyond clinical and basic science  creating theDepartment of Health Care Policy and that of Social Medicine (now called Global Health and Social Medicine).To help attract new faculty  Tosteson renovated most of the Medical School’s existing buildings  which had remained untouched since their construction in 1906. He also had several new ones constructed  including the Warren Alpert Building for basic research.To finance these initiatives  Tosteson boosted HMS’s endowment from $128 million to $1.1 billion. At a time when other academic institutions eschewed collaborations with industry  Tosteson pursued support from corporations with strong programs in biomedical research and development  even while he protected the intellectual independence and discoveries of Harvard’s faculty. At the same time  Tosteson oversaw development of the School’s first conflict-of-interest policy that has served as a national model.Tosteson opened the Medical School to a range of innovative initiatives. With Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise of Italy  he established the Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation to support multidisciplinary  basic research by leading scientists at HMS and Italian institutions.Under Tosteson’s leadership  HMS also established a publishing venture  nowHarvard Health Publications  which helps faculty authors with the support and publishing expertise to produce and disseminate high-quality medical and health care information for a lay audience through books  newsletters  and electronic services.“Dan Tosteson was a man of action ” said Marc Kirschner  chair of the Department of Systems Biology at HMS. “He was inspired by a vision through which he reinvented medical education  completely renovated the aging physical structure of the Medical School  created new departments and then hired the very best scientists to lead them. Despite his outward formality  I will remember Dan as a passionate and loving person who created a unique community at Harvard  largely through his selfless commitment and fueled by his tireless personal efforts.”Throughout his administrative career  Tosteson maintained his position as a laboratory researcher at the forefront of membrane phenomena. This work has led to a better understanding of degenerative diseases including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.A Milwaukee native  Tosteson attended Harvard College and was a 1949 graduate of Harvard Medical School. He completed his medical residency at New York’s Presbyterian Hospital and held fellowships at Brookhaven National Laboratories  the National Institutes of Health  and Cambridge University in England. He served on the faculty at Duke University Medical School for 14 years  first as a professor and then as the chair of physiology and pharmacology. The two years prior to coming to HMS as dean  he was dean of the Division of Biological Science and vice president of the University of Chicago Medical Center.Over his long career  Tosteson received numerous awards and honors  including the Abraham Flexner Award for Distinguished Service to Medical Education from the Association of American Medical Colleges  the Harvard Medal for extraordinary service to Harvard University  and honorary degrees from New York University  Johns Hopkins University  the Université Catholique de Louvain  Duke University  Emory University  and Ludwig Maximilians University. Last year  Tosteson received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Harvard University in recognition of his outstanding achievements.Tosteson was a member of several scientific and scholarly societies  including the Institute of Medicine  the Association of American Physicians  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  where he served as president from 1997 to 2000.In addition to science  poetry was an important part of Tosteson’s life  and he kept a large portrait of Robert Frost in his office. “He believed strongly in the perfectibility of humans ” Adelstein said  “but science was only one tool; the humanistic side was equally important.”Tosteson is survived by his wife  Magdalena Tosteson  a lecturer on biophysics in the HMS Department of Cell Biology  of Chestnut Hill  Mass.; sons Joshua of Brooklyn  N.Y.; and Tor of Lyme  N.H.; and daughters Heather of Chattanooga  Tenn.; Ingrid of Chestnut Hill; and Zoe Tosteson Losada of Caracas  Venezuela.A memorial service will be held to honor the life of Tosteson at the Memorial Church  Harvard Yard  Cambridge on Sept. 30 at 3 p.m. Please join us as we recognize his many contributions to HMS and to the advancement of medical education and science.
Ernest May  Harvard professor and eminent historian of international relations  dies at 80,Ernest May  a renowned historian of international relations and foreign policy and professor of history at Harvard University  died on June 1 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from complications following surgery  according to his family. He was 80.An esteemed member of the Harvard community for more than 55 years  May came to Harvard in 1954  was named associate professor of history in 1959  and became professor of history in 1963.May served as dean of Harvard College from 1969 to 1971  during a time of upheaval and unrest on many college campuses. In 1969  under May’s deanship  Harvard College began its first comprehensive re-examination of undergraduate education in 25 years. From 1971 to 1972  May was associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.“Ernest May was a wonderfully distinguished scholar and historian. He was beloved and admired by the Harvard community  and widely respected for his caring leadership as dean of Harvard College ” says Michael D. Smith  dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and John H. Finley Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard.May served as chair of the Department of History from 1976 to 1979. In 1981  May was named Charles Warren Professor of American History.May was also a member of the faculty at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard (HKS)  and a member of the board of directors of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. He was director of the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics from 1971 to 1974.“Ernest May was a man of uncommon wisdom and humanity — a rare gem whose sparkling insights influenced many of us ” said HKS Dean David T. Ellwood. “He played an absolutely vital role in the Kennedy School and the University and was a world-renowned international historian  who devoted his life to teaching people how to use history to make effective policy decisions. We all mourn the loss of our friend  and we will miss him dearly.”“Ernest was widely recognized as the leading international historian in the country ” says Graham Allison  Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at the Harvard Kennedy School and director of the Belfer Center. “No historian in recent memory so successfully bridged the chasm between history and public policy. Ernest demonstrated that the best source of insight into current policy choices is to be found in a sound analysis of history. It is hard to visualize Harvard without him.”Born in Fort Worth  Texas  in 1928  May received his A.B. in 1948 and Ph.D. in 1951  both from the University of California  Los Angeles.May’s first book  “The World War & American Isolation 1914-17 ” was published by Harvard University Press in 1959  and won the George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association for the best work of that year.May was co-author  with John Caughey and John Hope Franklin  of “Land of the Free” (Franklin Publications; Benziger Bros.  1965) an eighth-grade textbook that changed the way American history was taught by emphasizing primary sources and a more modern worldview.May was also the author of a dozen other books  including “Thinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers” (Free Press  1986)  written with Richard Neustadt. In 1988 he received the first Grawemeyer Award for “Ideas Improving World Order ” with Neustadt.“Professionally  within the field of America’s relations with the outside world  Ernest was the leading historian of the second half of the 20th century ” says Philip Zelikow  White Burkett Miller Professor of History at the University of Virginia. “As a teacher  his influence has been even more wide-ranging  leading Harvard’s Arts and Sciences faculty during difficult times and becoming a founding pillar of the Kennedy School of Government  while molding generations of other scholars now teaching around the world.“But above all  as a person  it is hard to think of anyone who was at once so luminous and so beloved by so many students and colleagues. We may regret his absence in our scholarly conversations. But we will miss  and miss  his gentle spirit.”With Zelikow  May was co-author of “The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis” (Harvard University Press  1997)  which analyzed detailed transcriptions of meetings and phone calls that took place during the Cuban missile crisis. The book was later turned into a feature film.In 2002  May was awarded the American Historical Association’s Award for Scholarly Distinction  for pioneering research in international relations. From 2002 to 2004  May was senior adviser to the 9/11 Commission.“Ernest May himself had much to do in broadening the field  for he was a passionate researcher in the archives of many countries ” says Akira Iriye  Charles Warren Research Professor of American History at Harvard. “He was interested not just in the top governmental leaders but also in public opinion  as he strongly believed that in a democratic country  foreign policy decisions ultimately reflected the public’s perspectives and interests.”May is survived by his wife  Susan B. Wood of Cambridge  Mass.; son  John E. May of Wenham  Mass.; daughter S. Rachel May of Syracuse  N.Y.; and daughter Donna L. May of Los Angeles. He is also survived by three grandchildren.
Judah Folkman,Judah Folkman was born Moses Judah Folkman in 1933. The son of a rabbi  he became inspired to become a physician as a young boy when visiting ailing members of the congregation with his father. He soon became fascinated with science and medicine  and as a high school student he devised a perfusion system in his basement that maintained the viability of a beating rat heart for days after surgical removal. This led to his admission at age 15 to nearby Ohio State University  where Judah worked part-time all four years in the surgical laboratory of Dr. Robert Zollinger. He quickly mastered surgical skills and became an active participant in the exciting world of academic surgery. Judah entered Harvard Medical School at 19  where he was welcomed into the laboratory of Dr. Robert Gross  then Surgeon-in-Chief at Children’s Hospital. There  he invented the first implantable heart pacemaker. Based on his scientific contributions  Judah was elected to the AOA and received the Boylston Medical Prize  Soma Weiss Award  and Borden Undergraduate Research Award in Medicine  when he graduated magna cum laude from HMS in 1957.Judah became a surgical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital where he had his first introduction to Pediatric Surgery under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hardy Hendren. Midway through his residency  Judah married the love of his life  Paula Prial  who was to become the mother of his wonderful daughters  Marjorie and Laura  and his closest confidant for the remainder of his life. Soon thereafter  Judah enlisted in the United States Navy to fulfill his military obligations for two years. He did research on artificial blood substitutes at the National Naval Medical Center. In the course of this work  he invented the first implantable device for sustained drug-release that was later known as Norplant  which he donated patent-free to the World Population Council for use as a contraceptive. While in the Navy  Judah also observed that tiny fragments of tumor could remain viable  but would not grow beyond approximately one millimeter in diameter  when implanted into an isolated perfused thyroid. This led to his provocative proposal that tumors must stimulate growth of new blood capillaries to provide oxygen and nutrients necessary for their continued proliferation and expansion æ a process known as “tumor angiogenesis”. He also reasoned that cancer growth might be held in check by inhibiting this processJudah Folkman returned to MGH to complete his training in 1962  and became Chief Resident. There  he jury-rigged materials to create a renal dialysis system for a patient with acute renal failure  and saved the patient’s life. He assumed his first faculty position as an Assistant Professor of Surgery on the Harvard Surgical Service at the then Boston City Hospital in 1965. In a tiny laboratory in the basement of the Sears Surgical Building  he began in earnest his career-long study of tumor blood vessels that would ultimately open up the new field of vascular biology. Based on his keen intelligence  outstanding clinical skills and scientific promise  Judah was soon selected to succeed Gross as the Surgeon-in-Chief at Children’s Hospital. However  he chose to acquire six months of additional Pediatric Surgery training under Dr. C. Everett Koop at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia  before he assumed this position at the unprecedented young age of 35 in 1967.As faculty member and surgeon at HMS and Children’s Hospital  Judah was known as a talented and caring surgeon  a gifted teacher  and a master of differential diagnosis. Crowds of students and residents swarmed around him on rounds because of his ability to meld modern biology with clinical practice  and he was the recipient of numerous HMS teaching awards for his introductory lectures to first and second year students. His devotion to patients and families was legendary  as was their appreciation of his technical skills and personal warmth. Judah even made time for those he had never met but who sought his counsel  returning phone calls every day when he returned home from the lab late at night  to be sure that he addressed each patient’s needs. When as a young man  Judah told his father that he would become a physician instead of a rabbi  his father responded  “then you will become a rabbi-like doctor”; and that is exactly what Judah did.Despite his heavy administrative burden and extensive surgical responsibilities  Judah remained passionate about his mission as physician-scientist  and continued to expand his research efforts focused on tumor angiogenesis. In 1974  Judah changed academic medicine and Harvard University by accepting the first large industrial-funded research grant from Monsanto Company to support his cancer research. As a result  for the first time  Harvard permitted its faculty to submit patents covering medical inventions. Judah’s successful experiment in corporate funding also paved the way for industrial support of academic research laboratories at universities and research institutions across the nation  which is commonplace today.In 1981  Judah elected to relinquish clinical leadership of the department of Pediatric Surgery to work full-time in his burgeoning laboratory. Although Judah lacked formal expertise in biochemistry or cell biology  he had an uncanny ability to ask penetrating questions  and he had a single-mindedness and tenacity of purpose that was beyond description. He initially attracted HMS students  and gradually postdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists  to work in his Surgical Research Laboratory in the Enders Building at Children’s Hospital  and systematically began to build the case for the tumor angiogenesis hypothesis.Judah’s angiogenesis theory was initially met with great skepticism because he proposed that cancers secrete a ‘tumor angiogenesis factor’ to stimulate neovascularization  but it had not yet been identified or purified. He realized that the major obstacle was the lack of bioassays to identify this activity. As a great innovator  Judah developed multiple new experimental systems to measure and study angiogenesis factors  including the first capillary endothelial cell cultures  in vitro angiogenesis models  and sustained release polymers for testing of putative angiogenesis modulators in rabbit corneas. The availability of these assays led to the purification of the first tumor angiogenesis factor  basic fibroblast growth factor in 1984. This discovery was followed by the isolation and cloning of multiple angiogenic factors by researchers around the world  which confirmed the critical role of angiogenesis for tumor growth as well as many other diseases. Thanks to Judah’s perseverance  admonition quickly became admiration and  as he used to say  “my critics soon became my competitors”.Judah’s tumor angiogenesis hypothesis launched an era of discovery and validation  during which his team at Children’s Hospital discovered numerous additional angiogenic factors  as well endogenous molecules that inhibit capillary growth  including angiostatin  endostatin  and angiostatic steroids  and they began deciphering the molecular basis of angiogenic control. This work led to development of numerous anti-angiogenic drugs  some of which entered human clinical trials  including TNP-470  Thalidomide  and Endostatin. There are now multiple angiogenesis inhibitors approved for clinical use  which are benefiting more than one million people worldwide. Judah’s impact on cancer alone was impressive in that the FDA now recognizes anti-angiogenesis as an entirely new modality for the treatment of cancer  along with chemotherapy  radiation therapy and surgery. Equally impressive is that angiogenesis inhibitors have restored sight in patients who are blind due to age-related macular degeneration; these drugs have become the clinical standard of care in Ophthalmology.Judah authored some 400 peer-reviewed papers and more than 100 book chapters and monographs. Over 38 000 articles have been published on angiogenesis  the field that he pioneered. He received scores of awards and honors for his distinguished research  including the National Institutes of Health’s Christopher Columbus Discovery Award in Biomedical Research  American Cancer Society’s Medal of Honor for Basic Science  Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Award For Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research  HMS’s Warren Alpert Prize  Canada’s Gairdner Foundation International Award  Israel’s Wolf Foundation Prize in Medicine  Germany’s Ernst Schering Prize  the Italian Association of Cancer Research in Rome’s Gold Medal  the United Kingdom Society for Endocrinology’s Dale Medal  and Switzerland’s Dr. Josef Steiner Cancer Research Award. Judah also was elected to the National Academy of Sciences  Institute of Medicine  American Academy of Arts and Sciences  American Philosophical Society  and membership on the President’s Cancer Advisory Board  in addition to receiving numerous honorary degrees from leading universities around the world. The research lab he founded with a single assistant when he arrived at Children’s Hospital in 1967 had  by the time of his death  grown into a 125 scientist-strong Vascular Biology Program. And  more than 1000 labs around the world are now pursuing angiogenesis research  yielding thousands of angiogenesis-related publications each year.Judah’s contributions in the laboratory have permanently transformed our thinking about cancer and many other diseases  and they have pointed the way to novel strategies for their treatment. But Judah also was known for illuminating lectures that left his listeners spellbound  whether experts or novices  and that created innumerable new scientific converts as he traveled around the globe spreading his vision. His lecture style was enthralling  his enthusiasm contagious  and his self-deprecating humor a foil for the seriousness of his subject. Judah always shared his latest insights and unpublished data because he did not see his scientific competitors as enemies  but as potential allies. To Judah  the enemy was the disease he was trying to cure  or the technology he strived to develop to overcome obstacles that stood in his way.Judah Folkman was an inspirational leader in everything that he did. For those of us who were blessed with the chance to work closely with him  we remember Judah best for his warmth  his humor  and his incredible mentoring skills. He mentored from the first light of day until his head hit the pillow and probably thereafter in his dreams. Most of all  however  Judah mentored by the example of his perseverance  his willingness to move in different directions  and his sheer boyish delight in discovery. Whereas most people saw a lump of coal and spurned others who strived to look further  Judah walked forth boldly  turned it over and found a diamond. He did this with experiments  but more importantly  he did this with people  whether patients  students  technicians  workmen  colleagues or competitors. His death on January 14  2008 was a terrible loss to our community  and to the entire world. We will all miss him greatly.Donald Ingber  MD  PhD (Chair  Folkman Memorial Minute Committee)Patricia Donahoe  MDMichael Gimbrone  MDW. Hardy Hendren  MDMichael Klagsbrun  PhDMarsha Moses  PhD
William Curry Moloney,William Curry Moloney was born in Boston on December 19  1907. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester and then Tufts Medical School and took up the practice of Hematology on the Tufts service at Boston City Hospital in 1932. He was married to the late Josephine O’Brien for more than 50 years and they had four children William Jr.  Thomas  Patricia and Elizabeth.When he was eight years old he saw Babe Ruth pitch for the Red Sox at Fenway Park just before the Babe was traded to the Yankees. Although he did not live long enough to see the Red Sox win the World Series and the end of the “Curse of the Bambino”  he did witness revolutionary changes in our understanding and treatment of patients with hematologic disorders. He was a devoted Bostonian and only left the Hub for service in World War II and for occasional medical or scientific expeditions.He joined the Army Medical Corps in 1942 and was sent to the European Theater where he set up a field hospital laboratory and transfusion service. On his way home from the war he stopped in Cambridge and met the famous English scientists Race and Sanger and learned of their work on the Rh blood group and its role in Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn. Although he returned to the full-time staff at Boston City Hospital  caring for indigent Bostonians  he maintained a small private practice and provided the first Rh typing service in Boston at his office on Bay State Road. The availability of Rh typing for pregnant women allowed him to predict which women were at risk of having jaundiced or hydropic babies and helped to facilitate exchange transfusions and eventually ways to prevent Rh immunization.Although Moloney began his career as a generalist  he developed an intense interest in patients with hematologic malignancies  particularly those with acute leukemia  which was essentially untreatable in the 50s and early 60s. He tried available chemotherapy that had been successful in children with acute leukemia and  when it failed  provided his patients with compassionate end of life care. He did this intuitively and skillfully before the field of hospice care had been “invented”. Although he was not able to “cure” most of his patients  he became an authority on the treatment of leukemia in pregnancy and was one of the first to show that termination of pregnancy was not a necessity. He also became renowned for his skills in blood cell morphology and was widely sought to review difficult to impossible bone marrow samples. He was proud of his diagnostic skills  but lamented the lack of more sophisticated technology to analyze leukemic samples and complained that we were  “Stranded on the rocks of morphology.”Bill Moloney had certain traits  which remained unchanged throughout his long life. First  he was an astute and observant clinician. Long before the advent of computerized databases  Moloney had his own instantly updatable record of clinical encounters  which he kept in a small  worn loose-leaf notebook tucked into the pocket of his long white coat. The book contained lists of patient names  with dates  diagnoses and treatments. More than one review paper written with one of his fellows began by thumbing through the notebook. When questions arose on rounds  Bill would often open the book and review his recent experience with the disease under discussion.In 1952 he was invited to become Chief of the Hematology Division of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and went to Hiroshima to monitor the long-term effects of radiation on Japanese survivors living varying distances from ground zero. He published on the high incidence of chronic leukemias  primarily chronic myelogenous leukemia that occurred 8-10 years after exposure to radiation from the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The work in Japan made him understand both the power and the perils of atomic energy. He decided that  on balance  when used properly  it could benefit mankind and when he returned to the US he consulted for the nuclear power industry and lobbied for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.The Harvard Faculty who worked with Bill Moloney at Boston City Hospital included the late Drs. William B. Castle and James Jandl who admired his legendary clinical skills and his ability to analyze complicated bone marrows. Patients were segregated by disease type at the Boston City Hospital. Jandl and Castle eagerly sought patients with various forms of anemia and Moloney and his group took on the more difficult patients with hematologic malignancy. In order to make sure that fellows on the Harvard Thorndike service  as well as his own fellows from Tufts  were well trained in morphology  he initiated an informal late afternoon bone marrow morphology course that was a rite of passage for any new hematologist. The cases were difficult and even the best clinicians would be unlikely to diagnose more than fifty percent of the unknown cases correctly. Bill Moloney would unerringly guide the neophytes to just the right portion of the microscope slide where the diagnostic cells were located. He made it look easy.At the age of 60  when most men are thinking of retirement  Bill Moloney was recruited by George Thorn  then Hersey Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chairman of Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital  to develop a patient-oriented Hematology Service. Dr. Thorn was within a few years of his own retirement and wanted a short-term stop gap appointment so that the next Chairman would be free to reorganize the clinical services. Moloney remained active at the Brigham for another three decades where he developed a popular clinical service  continued his clinical research and inspired a new generation of hematologists. He was appointed Clinical Professor and then full Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and served as chief of hematology from 1966 to 1976. The new Chairman  Eugene Braunwald  encouraged him to stay on the staff where he received continued accolades from residents and fellows.Although work was the main focus of his long life  he developed a passion for tennis during his stay in Japan and played regularly at the Badminton and Tennis Club on Hemenway Street. One of the few events able to interrupt rounds or office consultations was a call from his regular tennis partner. Moloney had been advised by George Thorn to not give up tennis no matter how busy he was with his patients. Dr. Thorn told him that he occasionally left the hospital in the late afternoon for an important match and that nobody missed him. Given Moloney’s work load and patient responsibilities  most of his matches were scheduled for the early evening.Although Moloney admired science and was convinced that cures for leukemia and related disorders would only be found through basic science discovery  he felt that the proper place for a physician was with his patients and his students. He began each of his long days at the microscope with his fellows reviewing new cases and hearing about the status of inpatients. He spent the rest of the morning seeing new consultations in his cramped office and then gathered the entire team of fellows and junior faculty for several hours of rounds. He would visit each of the extremely sick hospitalized patients  asking probing questions  sharing his experience with the trainees about previous cases  prescribing therapy or consoling those for whom there was no therapy. He was an Irishman in the best sense of the word and always had a kind word  a gentle smile or a great story appropriate for any occasion. Despite the fact that  for many years  virtually all of the patients on his leukemia service died  he was able to inspire young people to enter the field with the understanding that there was a pressing need to care for current patients while they worked to develop future cures.For many years Bill lived with his beloved wife Josephine in a large home in Jamaica Plain. Shortly after he came to the Brigham they sold the house and bought a summer home in Chatham. Although they had a series of pieds a terre near the hospital over the next twenty years  their true home was now in Chatham where Bill canoed on the estuary near their home and assisted with gardening. He developed severe osteoarthritis with massive Heberden’s nodes on both hands. Despite the discomfort  his arthritis never prevented him from picking up a tennis racket or helping Josephine maintain her garden. The acquisition of the Chatham home changed his professional life a bit. In order to beat the traffic to the Cape he tried to start Friday rounds earlier but inevitably stayed until decisions were made for each patient and the fellows and faculty were satisfied.During Moloney’s tenure at the Brigham there was a remarkable transformation in the cancer field at Harvard. Largely ignored as a clinical discipline at the major teaching hospitals  by the early 70’s it was an area of growing clinical interest. As new leadership came to Boston to develop oncology  including Samuel Hellman who created the Joint Center for Radiotherapy and Emil (Tom) Frei  who became the first President of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute  Moloney befriended them and initiated important collaborations. He helped to carry out one of the first trials of the new drugs daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside in acute myelogenous leukemia in adults and saw remissions go from <10% to over 50%. He partnered with David Nathan to develop a joint Pediatric-Adult bone marrow transplant service and administered new combination chemotherapy regimens to patients with Hodgkin’s Disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Somehow  he was once again in the right place at the right time with an open mind  willing patients and valued clinical skills.Although he served as chief of hematology for only ten years  he remained one of the dominant hematology clinicians until his death in 1999. He never really retired  just took on a series of important but somewhat less taxing assignments. After he stopped seeing patients  he continued to review and provide the official interpretation for bone marrow aspirates. He insisted that marrow samples be sent to his Chatham home by courier so he could keep up with reviews during brief vacations and long weekends. At the age of 91 while undergoing treatment for a particularly stubborn lymphoma he moved into an assisted living facility in Brookline.Since he was near the Longwood Medical Area  he had frequent visitors from the Brigham who came to talk and often took him out to dinner. In addition to faculty and physician colleagues  a devoted trio  a nurse  a social worker and a secretary from the Brigham also visited him regularly. Shortly before he died  he commented that the residents at his assisted living facility were not impressed with the Harvard luminaries who came to see him  but wanted to know what he did to attract such lovely young women. Bill Moloney simply smiled.Respectfully submitted Robert I. Handin  ChairpersonEugene BraunwaldH. Franklin BunnDavid NathanDavid Rosenthal
Renowned Lincoln historian David Herbert Donald dies at 88,David Herbert Donald  Charles Warren Professor of American History and Professor of American Civilization Emeritus  died Sunday (May 17) of heart failure at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was 88. Donald  a leading historian of Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War  was born in 1920 in Goodman  Miss.  then a segregated town  to Ira Unger Donald and Sue Ella Donald  a cotton planter and former schoolteacher  respectively. In his early years  Donald thought of himself as a musician rather than a historian.He earned a B.Sc. from Millsaps College in Jackson  Miss. After graduating  Donald hitchhiked north to Indianola  Miss.  where he interviewed for the job of high school band teacher  a position funded by sales from a Coca-Cola machine.“The man who interviewed me told me I could have the job and I went to gather whatever I had and started to follow him out of his office ” Donald recalled during a 2005 interview with the Associated Press (AP). “He said  ‘You forgot your hat.’ And I said  ‘I don’t wear a hat.’ And he said  ‘You teach in my school  you’ll wear a hat.’ So I didn’t take the job.”He briefly studied sociology and history at the University of North Carolina before eventually earning his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. There  he was research assistant to the great Lincoln scholar J.G. Randall.During his long career  Donald wrote more than 30 books  two of which garnered Pulitzer Prizes: “Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War” and “Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe.” But he is best known for his work on Lincoln  and his admiration for the former president shone in his biography “Lincoln ” which is widely heralded as the best of all Lincoln biographies.Donald came to Harvard in 1973.“We  his students  knew we could never equal him ” recalled historian and writer Troy Gil ’88 in an article for the History News Network. “He was so dedicated  intelligent  and accomplished in his lecturing and his writing. To watch David Donald as he conjured up the Jacksonian era  what he called ‘the Age of Ambiguity ’ to hear him map out the road to disunion  to see him in action dominating the lecture hall or the seminar room  was intellectually inspirational — yet professionally intimidating.”Donald’s was so respected by Lincoln experts that an award was created in his name. The David Herbert Donald Prize awards those for excellence in Lincoln studies — in 2005  Donald was the first recipient.He married Aida DiPace in 1955. The Donalds had one son  Bruce Randall  a professor of computer science and biochemistry at Duke University.“When I started out  I wasn’t interested in Lincoln  and frankly found him a tiresome old fellow who was rather long-winded  told too many stories  was kind of a rough  frontier sort ” said Donald during his AP interview. “As I grew older  I realized the jokes and stories he told were really very funny and they always had a point to them. And I watched the way he worked with people and what an extraordinarily adept politician he was. … He was much more sensitive and human than I had thought before.”At the time of his death  Donald was working on a character study of John Quincy Adams.Donald was buried in Lincoln Cemetery on Wednesday (May 20).
Omeljan Pritsak,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 5  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Omeljan Pritsak was a man of seemingly inexhaustible energy  broad erudition  and total dedication to scholarship in a broad range of fields. While he will probably be best remembered at Harvard and in the Ukrainian diaspora community as the co-founder and long-time director of Harvard’s Ukrainian Research Institute  his energy  erudition  and scholarship also found expression in a prodigious output of scholarly work and in institution-building in several countries and many scholarly fields. He was founder  editor  or an early stalwart of a number of periodical and monographic series—first in Germany  then in this country  and  ultimately  in his native Ukraine. His prodigious range and productivity is only partially captured by the published bibliographies of his works.Pritsak was born on 7 April 1919 in Luka  in the Sambir region of Ukraine  and completed his secondary education at the Polish “First Gymnasium” of Ternopil’  where for some years he was the only Ukrainian student. His higher education  with a concentration in Ukrainian and  increasingly over time  Turkic history and philology  took place at the University of L’viv  at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv  and  after World War II (during which he became first a Red Army soldier  then a prisoner of war  then an Ost-Arbeiter)  at the Universities of Berlin and Göttingen  the latter of which awarded him a doctorate in 1948.Pritsak was invited to visit Harvard University for the academic year 1960–61 and returned to Harvard as Professor of Linguistics and Turcology in 1964. He retired in 1989.By the time of his arrival in Cambridge  Pritsak had already become an internationally recognized specialist in historical and comparative Turkic and Altaic linguistics and a leading authority on the history and cultures of the Eurasian steppe. He was the first scholar to solve problems of succession in Turkic tribal royalty  especially in the first Turkic Islamic dynasty of the Karakhanids. At Harvard  he turned increasingly to the analysis of the Ukrainian past in its larger context  drawing on his training in the relevant oriental languages to flesh out that history with material previously underrepresented or unknown.In 1967 Pritsak proposed the creation of a firm foundation for the development of Ukrainian studies at Harvard through the establishment of three endowed chairs (history  literature  and philology) and a research institute. This project was accomplished thanks to the efforts of the Ukrainian Studies Fund  which raised the necessary funds within the North-American Ukrainian diaspora community. The Ukrainian Research Institute was founded in 1973 and Pritsak became its first director. In 1975 he was named to the new Hrushevs’kyi Chair in Ukrainian history.In most of his work  Pritsak was very much a structuralist. Therein lay the basis of his close collaboration with Roman Jakobson (1896–1982)  especially in the International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics (The Hague: Mouton)  which Jakobson edited in the mid-1960s. Pritsak also took a very pronounced structuralist view of genealogy and chronology—although his interest in these fields may have originated with some adolescent discoveries about his own birth and parentage.He could overreach himself  as specialist reviewers of his The Origins of Rus’ (Harvard 1981) have been quick to point out. He was impatient with critics  spending very little energy in engaging with their views. He insisted that the cultural history of the East Slavs (and for him political institutions were a part of cultural history) must be viewed in the broadest Eurasian terms  taking fully into account the experiences of Scandinavian  Turkic  Baltic  and other Slavic peoples and sources in their languages.The great majority of those who challenge Pritsak’s conclusions on the origins of Rus’ themselves view history in primarily “national” categories  but—despite his dedication to Ukrainian history—he explicitly did not. It is true  however  that when asked by one of those signed below why his projected book on the Origins of Rus’ would be in six volumes  he is said to have replied  “Because Ochmanski’s ‘Origins of Poland’ is in three.”In one of his last general articles on the subject  he was particularly direct: “The history of Ukraine is not the history of the Ukrainian ethnic mass (ethnicity is not a historical subject) but the objective view  measured in linear time  of all types of states and communities which existed on the present territory of Ukraine in the past.”Nor was he a “Normanist ” as is sometimes alleged. While his inaugural lecture in the Hrushevs’kyi Chair began with the story of the uproar caused by Gerhard Friedrich Müller’s 1749 lecture  “Origines gentis et nominus Russorum ” and his later work stressed the role of Scandinavians (among others) in the founding of “Kyivan Rus’ ” he steadfastly insisted that the entity that emerged in the eighth and ninth centuries was multi-ethnic and multicultural at its core.After retirement  Pritsak became more involved in the post-Soviet struggle for the revival of academic historical studies in Ukraine  spending increasing amounts of his time there (despite a serious cardiac condition that had led to surgery as early as 1977). He became the first elected foreign member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences  and revived the Institute of Oriental Studies in Kyiv  introducing new university-level programs in that field and many other neglected areas of historical scholarship. Sadly  however  even a man of his astuteness and dynamism was unable to escape the tangled webs of post-Soviet academic politics and intrigue: these years were filled with disappointments.By that time  however  Pritsak’s major work had been accomplished. It has transformed our understanding of East Slavic history. Never again will any serious historian of the region be able to treat the history of this space as anything but the history of—in his words—a “multiethnic and multilingual” society.Omeljan Pritsak is survived by his wife Larysa Hvozdik Pritsak; by his daughter  Irene Pritsak (by his late first wife  Nina née Nikolaevna Moldenhauer); and by two grandchildren  Lailina Eberhard and Michael Wissoff.Respectfully submitted Michael S.

Jeremy Randall Knowles,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 5  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Jeremy Knowles  former Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences  a longtime professor of chemistry and biochemistry  and a world leader in the study of catalysis by enzymes  died of cancer at his home in Cambridge  on April 3  2008  at the age of 72. He was deeply respected and admired by colleagues at Harvard and around the world.Jeremy Randall Knowles was born in Rugby (UK) on April 28  1935  and received his secondary education at Magdalen College School in Oxford just after World War II. After serving in the Royal Air Force as a Pilot Officer from 1953 to 1955  he attended Balliol College  Oxford  graduating with First Class Honors in 1959 and then continued at Oxford to the Ph.D. degree in physical organic chemistry in 1961. After postdoctoral work at the California Institute of Technology  Jeremy returned to Oxford and held various posts before becoming University Lecturer (1966–1974). He held visiting professorships at Yale (1969 and 1971) and at Harvard (1973) before joining the Harvard Faculty as Professor of Chemistry in 1974. Five years later  he was named Amory Houghton Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry.During his early independent career at Oxford  Jeremy’s research interests turned from traditional organic chemistry to the understanding of protein catalysis at the atomic level of detail using the principles and methods of physical organic chemistry. He quickly became an international leader in this new and fast-moving field  one being propelled by an explosion of knowledge and the first glimpses into the three-dimensional structure of proteins as a result of the combined power of computers and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Jeremy’s interests went beyond structure for  as he remarked in 1966  “Taking a photograph of a horse does not necessarily tell you how fast it can run.” His move from Oxford  where his father served on the faculty  to Harvard  was astonishing to some  but perhaps not to those who knew him best. His description of the move to Harvard revealed an eagerness to discover and take on weighty challenges that would surprise few who knew him.Why am I going? Having been in Oxford for so long  I was very happily settled  both departmentally and socially  and Oxford is a splendid place to live. But the challenge of a new and exciting environment in the end became dominant. Am I going to stay? The mark of a very good department (also of a very bad one) is when its turnover among staff is very small. I think it’s true that  despite alluring offers from elsewhere  nobody in the history of Harvard’s Chemistry Department has ever left  except for one man—Conant—who left to become President of Harvard!As fate would have it  Jeremy would later follow the path of Conant to high administrative office  in Jeremy’s case as Dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1991–2002 and 2006–2007).Once at Harvard  Jeremy’s research program thrived and grew to encompass a wide range of subjects from the chemical end of the spectrum—including entirely new general methods for probing fundamental chemical reaction pathways—to the understanding of enzyme catalysis in biochemistry  and to distinctly biological topics. For instance  in the last area he provided the first direct evidence for the importance of the hypervariable regions of the immune system’s antibodies.In the early 1970s  Knowles’s work led to the first complete description of the energetics of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction using extraordinarily subtle and elegant analyses and experiments. This research attracted great attention since it showed that the enzyme had reached the limit of catalytic efficiency in the sense that further lowering of the energy barriers of the chemical steps could not result in faster rates of conversion of biochemical substrate to reaction product. The precision and rigor of thinking behind these advances is quite remarkable even from the vantage of the present  three decades later. Jeremy’s scientific work reflects the qualities so apparent to those who knew him: a powerful and deep intellect  a relentlessly logical and thorough style of research  and great care in selecting and executing projects.In the classroom  Jeremy was no less effective. His courses and lectures became very popular with science students at both undergraduate and graduate levels. They have been described as exacting and challenging  but clear  engaging  and witty. Jeremy’s research students were devoted and highly motivated. Many graduates from his laboratory have gone on to positions of leadership in academia and in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. Jeremy’s influence and wisdom were of great value in his departmental home  Chemistry  which he chaired from 1980 to 1983  and in his other Harvard affiliation  the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He was an extraordinarily well organized  efficient  eloquent  and perceptive administrator  a consensus builder  and a sympathetic colleague.Jeremy’s professional contributions were recognized by many honors and awards including the Charmian Medal  the Bader Award  the Repligen Award  the Prelog Medal  the Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry  and the Nakanishi Prize. He was awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society and was an honorary fellow of Balliol College and of Wadham College  Oxford. He received honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich  and he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 1993. For nearly a decade he was a Trustee of theHoward Hughes Medical Institute  where he was deeply engaged in both the Institute’s scientific and educational activities.In 1991 Jeremy assumed office as Dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Jeremy’s acceptance of this post  in several respects more than a full-time occupation  came as a surprise to many of his friends because he was so devoted to teaching and research. To others  it seemed a very logical move given Jeremy’s multiplicity of skills  his personal warmth and  above all  his devotion to Harvard.He took up what he later called a “wet-weather deanship ” marked by significant academic challenges and substantial financial deficits. Although the early Knowles era was one of comparative frugality  academic challenges were met and the deficit was retired. Renovation of the eleven freshman dorms and the gathering of seventeen humanities departments into Barker and Boylston were only the beginning of a great run of physical improvements over his eleven years as dean. His deep concern for undergraduate education was manifest in the creation of the Educational Policy Committee in 1992  an early analytic report on the College administration and subsequent reforms  a review of the Core  and toward the end of his deanship  a reinvigoration of the Freshman Seminar Program. He later taught in the program he had revived: first a course on right-left asymmetries in science and then one on implications of the global use of antibiotics.By the late 1990s  money worries had eased with successful fund raising and gains in the financial markets. New faculty appointments were made. Science was strengthened by the creation of centers for genomics  nanoscale systems  systems biology  and brain science. The last of the buildings he planned were for the sciences  and he lived to see the Naito Laboratory  Bauer Genomics Center  the Northwest Science Building  and the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering rise along Oxford Street. The Center for Government and International Studies brought together the Government department with international research centers. Jeremy often said that he wished he had accomplished more for the graduate students and more for science sooner. Nonetheless  he was  not the least by the testimony of Harvard presidents past and present  a very good dean  and perhaps one of the truly great ones.One of the undersigned (Neil L. Rudenstine) characterized Jeremy’s tenure as dean:Deans and leaders like Jeremy come only rarely. He had a penetrating mind. He had wit and charm and taste. Above all  he understood the nature of a university and what it meant to search for knowledge  or discover even a single truth. The standard could never be too high. Many other things mattered  of course. But if learning  teaching  and research were not the heart of the matter  why were we here? Once he had decided to leave his lab and serve the University in more than chemistry  nothing less than all his energy and stamina would do. He was no less a friend. If there was a need for more than mere intelligence or skill  he was there  with his strength and his commitment.Harvard’s President Drew Faust wrote:Jeremy was my friend and mentor. He set the standard for selfless service  inspiring us with his dedication even as he delighted us with his wit and intelligence. The purpose of deans  he once remarked  is making things right  and he gave himself fully to that effort. We are profoundly in his debt.Jeremy was called back to be dean again  in 2006. Living with illness  he nevertheless carried off his last year as dean with characteristic focus and grace. Former President Derek Bok  who with Rudenstine and Faust called Jeremy a friend  said:His final year of service as a dean must surely rank as one of the most selfless acts of loyalty in Harvard’s history. Under very trying circumstances  he succeeded in restoring a badly needed sense of momentum and progress at a critical time for his Faculty. We all owe him an enormous debt.Jeremy Knowles had an extraordinarily large circle of friends and admirers at Harvard  worldwide in the sciences  and beyond  and at many educational  corporate  and philanthropic institutions. He is survived by his wife Jane  a gifted person and wonderful friend to so many at Harvard; three sons  Sebastian  Julius and Timothy; and seven grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Andrew G.

Business School’s Milton P. Brown  retail and marketing expert  90,Harvard Business School (HBS) Professor Emeritus Milton P. Brown  an expert in retailing and marketing who for almost half a century influenced thousands of M.B.A. students and executives through his skills as an extraordinarily talented teacher  died on April 25 in Exeter  N.H. He was 90 years old.“Milt Brown had an almost magical ability to engage students and get them involved in meaningful discussions about important issues in a case study ” said Walter J. Salmon  the Stanley Roth Sr. Professor of Retailing Emeritus at HBS.Like all great teachers  Brown had a keen interest in his students. He “knew everyone’s name before the first day of class ” recalled Stephen A. Greyser  the School’s Richard P. Chapman Professor of Business Administration Emeritus and once a student in Brown’s first-year marketing class.Although Brown was an early proponent of the use of computers and innovative management techniques in retailing  he always emphasized the importance of customer service and simply observing where change was happening in the marketplace and then trying to adapt to it as quickly as possible. “Unlike managers in many other businesses ” he said in a 1988 interview  “retailers can’t test-market their goods or formulate long-range plans that predict what will be in fashion in five years. Decision making is helped by the availability of more sophisticated data  but retailing is still an ad hoc  trial-and-error operation. If the red ones don’t sell  you mark them down and try some blue ones.”According to Greyser  Brown “focused students’ attention on the consumer in terms of the buying process and its implications for selling and marketing programs. He had an instinctive capability to push people to try to understand how customers thought.”During his career  Brown served as a director of some 17 companies. He said that his experience in the boardroom made him a better teacher in the classroom. “I was constantly facing new issues ” he explained. “In addition  the executives I met often made themselves available to visit my classes and talk with my students.”For more than two decades  he was also chairman and CEO of the Harvard Coop  founded in 1882 to provide books and merchandise to the Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology communities. Advising the Coop’s president  who watched over the day-to-day operations of the stores  Brown saw the Coop grow to encompass a number of branches and become one of the largest and most successful retail cooperatives of its kind in the country.Brown taught his first marketing class at HBS as a young instructor just after the end of World War II at the unexpected request of his mentor  the legendary HBS Professor Malcolm P. McNair  who organized the School’s first marketing and retailing courses and helped pioneer the development of case-method teaching. “I was paralyzed with fear  but I did it  although I never strayed more than six inches from the notes I had laid out all over the desk at the front of the room ” Brown once recalled.Brown began to develop a teaching style that was rigorous  dramatic  and lively. The case method satisfied his penchant for pragmatic experience rather than the development of theory. “I’ve always felt that when it comes to business  theory is relatively shallow ” he said. “By analyzing hundreds of cases  our students participate in a wide array of business experiences and decisions. My role was to help them see issues they might have missed without me  but not to give them answers.”Brown’s teaching also left a lasting mark on many senior executives in the School’s Advanced Management Program (AMP). One executive he inspired was a newspaper editor who wrote about Brown’s classroom technique in a column: “When Professor Brown wanted to make a point about the pervasiveness of Gold Toe socks in a case discussion about the men’s hosiery business  he asked how many students wore Gold Toes [so called because of their gold thread marks across the toes]. In seconds  70 men kicked off their shoes. Brown had eased back onto a desk  slipped off his loafers  and was wiggling his Gold Toes. ‘See that? See that?’ he asked enthusiastically.”Brown was a prolific case writer. During his HBS career  he published more than 150 cases  many of which became “excellent teaching vehicles for many years ” Salmon noted. He was well known among his research assistants as a stickler for precise English usage.From the 1940s through the early 1960s  Brown was involved in the research that went into a series of published annual statistical studies on the cost of doing business in retailing. Initiated by McNair in 1920 with the publication of “Operating Results of Department and Specialty Stores ” these 50- to 60-page booklets  commonly known as the “Harvard Reports ” were influential in the evolution of the retail industry into a service-oriented  cost-effective business.Born in Yonkers  N.Y.  on Jan. 19  1919  Milton Peers Brown grew up in Rochester  where he excelled in his studies from elementary school until his graduation from high school in 1936. He was also an accomplished musician  playing the flute and piccolo in school bands and orchestras.Although his mother was a high school teacher and his grandfather a professor  Brown never intended to pursue a career in the classroom. Entering Harvard College in the fall of 1936  he majored in economics. Beyond the classroom  he played intramural football until a knee injury took him off the gridiron permanently. He fared much better  though  as a member of the Harvard marching band. He first became interested in retailing in 1937  when he worked in a department store in Rochester the summer between his freshman and sophomore years at Harvard College.A member of John F. Kennedy’s class at Harvard College  Brown graduated cum laude in 1940 and entered HBS the next fall. To help pay his way  he sold his two instruments and accepted an offer from the Harvard Band to become its drillmaster. In that position  he earned $100 for planning the band’s half-time show formations at football games.After Pearl Harbor  Brown registered for the draft with all his classmates in the reading room of Baker Library  but because of his bad knee and nearsightedness  he didn’t pass the physical. An offer to become McNair’s research assistant kept him at the School after he earned his M.B.A. in 1942.“I had been thinking about going into retailing  but hadn’t been able to find a job ” he told an interviewer. “I thought I’d spend just a year or two with McNair and then leave  but I became more and more involved in my work  started teaching  liked it  and ended up staying on the faculty for 45 years.” Along the way  he met and married Joan Hawley  the daughter of an HBS faculty colleague  Henry C. Hawley. Promoted to full professor in 1958  Brown succeeded McNair as the Lincoln Filene Professor of Retailing in 1963. He retired from the active faculty in 1987 and received the Harvard Business School’s Distinguished Service Award in 1989.In 1973  Brown joined the Advisory Committee of the Navy Resale and Services Support Office (NAVRESSO). Created after World War II  the committee was made up of seven distinguished civilians who advised the top managers of the U.S. Navy’s worldwide network of commissaries and exchanges.Longtime residents of Weston  Mass.  Brown and his wife retired to Exeter  N.H. They spent summers in North Lovell  Maine  in a summer home they had both designed. In retirement  Brown made good on his promise to be “unemployed but not inactive.” Besides his duties with the Coop and NAVRESSO  he continued to serve on several boards  including that of Dunkin’ Donuts.In addition to his wife  Brown is survived by two daughters  Janet Slayton and Pamela Nahass  both of Millis  Mass.; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.Burial will be private. A memorial service is planned at 2 p.m. on July 25 in Lovell United Church of Christ in Center Lovell  Maine. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made in Brown’s memory to Seacoast Hospice  10 Hampton Road  Exeter  NH 03833.
Hendrik Samuel Houthakker,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences March 10  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Hendrik Samuel Houthakker  the late Henry Lee Professor of Economics  Emeritus  at Harvard University  lived a very rich and full life that brought him into contact with some of the great events of our time. He was born in Amsterdam in 1924 and lived through the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands. He received his doctorandus degree in economics at the University of Amsterdam in 1949 and immediately joined the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Cambridge.In 1950 Houthakker published a paper that assured him a permanent place in the history of economic thought  presenting his famous Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference. The force of this stunning contribution is well captured by Robert Pollak in the following words: “Economics  unlike mathematics  has relatively few classic well-posed problems whose solutions can make professional reputations. The original revealed preference problem was one of them.” Houthakker’s paper was cited in 1963 when he received the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association  awarded every other year to that economist under 40 who has made the most significant contribution to economics. The paper was one of two major themes in Pollak’s essay  “Houthakker’s Contributions to Economics ” written on the occasion of his election as Distinguished Fellow of the Association in 1988.From Cambridge Houthakker went to the Cowles Commission on Economics at the University of Chicago. His contributions to economics continued at a breathtaking pace and included the first of his important empirical studies of consumer demand  The Analysis of Family Budgets  with S. J. Prais. Houthakker’s empirical findings  like his theoretical work  have become an enduring part of economics. He moved to Stanford in 1954  where he met his wife  Anna-Teresa  and then to Harvard in 1960.It would be difficult to exaggerate Houthakker’s contributions to the Department of Economics at Harvard. He was a mentor to generations of junior faculty. He taught a wide variety of courses  beginning with econometrics and mathematical economics and later including international economics and financial economics. He served for twenty-one years as the sole editor of the Review of Economics and Statistics  then as now one of Harvard’s two leading journals of economics. Houthakker read many of the manuscripts himself  assigned the best to referees  and made the final editorial decisions. When he stepped down he was replaced by a committee. He was also acting chairman of the Department of Economics in 1987–88.A short description of Houthakker  written on the occasion of his passing by his friend and former colleague Andreu Mas-Colell  now professor of economics at the University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona  captures him well:“I was privileged to be his colleague at Harvard  where he received me with much kindness and I discovered a gentle man with very broad intellectual and social interests. My own proclivities led to many exchanges on revealed preference and aggregation theory. I distinctly recall them as most enlightening.”Houthakker was appointed to be a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1969 to 1971 by President Richard Nixon. This period included the collapse of Bretton Woods  the system of fixed parities for international currencies established after World War II. Writing about the secrecy with which the policies to resolve the financial crisis were formulated and implemented  Houthakker penned the following words  which now seem prescient:“In any democracy it is difficult to carry out policies without public awareness  public criticism  and public cooperation wherever possible. Under the U.S. Constitution  congressional involvement is even more essential  no matter how time-consuming and politically hazardous.”One of Houthakker’s interests  known to only a few of his colleagues and friends  was the social and ethical aspects of economics. In 1992 he organized a symposium on the centennial of the papal encyclical  Rerum Novarum  translated by the Vatican as “Capital and Labor.” This was written by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 and presented the papal view of capitalism  socialism  and the role of the state. In 1991 Pope John Paul II wrote the encyclical  Centesimus Annus (“In the Hundredth Year”). This brought the papal view up to date through the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the ongoing collapse of the Soviet Union. Chapter 5 presented an emphatic and elaborate statement of approval for the transition to democracy and a market economy then under way.Pope John Paul II had been a close friend of Anna-Teresa and Hendrik Houthakker since the 1970s  a story recounted in the biography His Holiness by Carl Bernstein of Bernstein and Woodward  and Marco Politi  the Italian journalist. The authors quote Houthakker on his conversations with John Paul II  then the Cardinal Archbishop Karol Wojtyla  “I tried to talk with him about the merits of capitalism and democracy  but I had a feeling I wasn’t getting anywhere.” The conversations between Houthakker and the Cardinal  later the Pope  eventually bore fruit. The symposium was a success and led to a book  Social and Ethical Aspects of Economics: A Colloquium in the Vatican  published in 1992.The symposium was among the services to the church acknowledged in Houthakker’s election as Knight Commander with Star in the Papal Order of Saint Gregory in 2003. The papal knighthood was added to the long list of honors he received  including Presidency of the Econometric Society in 1967  Vice Presidency of the American Economic Association in 1972  membership in the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  corresponding membership in the Netherlands Academy of Sciences and honorary degrees from his alma mater  the University of Amsterdam  and the University of Fribourg. He was devoted to economic research from his youth in Amsterdam until the very end of his life  and he received the honors that his originality  depth  and breadth of interests merited. He is survived by his wife of 52 years  Anna-Teresa  and his children Louis  Jan Nicholas  and Isabella Romana.Respectfully submitted Guido ImbensAndreu Mas-ColellJames StockDale Jorgenson  Chair
Rudolf Arnheim,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences March 10  2009  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Rudolf Arnheim  Professor of the Psychology of Art  Emeritus  in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies  experienced the culture and history of the twentieth century deeply and profoundly. A towering figure in the field of visual studies  Arnheim was born in an age when many remembered life without telephones. During his long and prodigiously productive scholarly life  Arnheim would witness the emergence of cinema  radio  and television. He was among the first theorists to write in significant ways about these new media of the twentieth century. A pioneer in the psychology of art with path-breaking books on visual perception and artistic creativity  Arnheim was also among the first to recognize the importance of film as a major art form. The first of his fourteen books  Film as Art (1932)  is still taught in university courses throughout the world. His most influential work  Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye  was published in 1954 and enlarged and revised in 1974. It has been translated into fourteen languages and is acknowledged to be one of the most influential art books of the last century.Known as Rudi to his many friends  Arnheim was born in 1904. In this year  Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Martin House in Buffalo  NY; Paul Cézanne painted Mont Sainte-Victoire; and the first motion picture house opened in Pittsburgh  PA. Arnheim’s father owned a small piano factory in Berlin and only permitted him to attend university if he spent half his time at the office learning the business. “As you can predict ” he related in one conversation  “I went more and more to the university and less and less to the office.” At the University of Berlin  Arnheim majored in psychology and philosophy with secondary emphases in the histories of art and music. There he studied with the great Gestalt psychologists Max Wertheimer  Wolfgang Köhler  and Kurt Lewin. After completing his doctorate in 1928 at the age of twenty-four with a thesis on expression in human faces and handwriting  Arnheim worked as a film critic and cultural affairs editor for Die Weltbühne  attended the plays of Bertolt Brecht in their original productions  visited the first exhibitions of German Expressionist art  and interviewed the great Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein.An eyewitness to the twentieth century’s dramatic and violent history  Arnheim was a vocal and courageous critic of the rise of Fascism in Europe. When the Nazis came to power in 1933  one of their earliest acts was to forbid publications by Jewish authors. Arnheim’s book on film  published only months earlier  was withdrawn from circulation. He decided to leave Germany  moving first to Rome  where for the next six years he wrote about film under the aegis of the League of Nations. He also completed his second book  an early study of radio. When Mussolini withdrew from the League of Nations and adopted Hitler’s racial politics  Arnheim left for London  where he served as a translator for the British Broadcasting Corporation.Arnheim came to the United States in the fall of 1940  arriving with only ten dollars in his pocket. Max Wertheimer arranged a position for him as a visiting lecturer on the graduate faculty of the New School for Social Research. His career in the new country quickly flourished. In 1942 he received a major grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue research at the Columbia University Office of Radio Research on the public effects of soap operas. Two years later he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the role of perception in art  which became the foundation of Arnheim’s book Art and Visual Perception. In 1951 Arnheim was awarded a second grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to complete this path-breaking book  which maintains that perception is an active process inseparable from cognition and meaning making  and that artistic expression is a form of reasoning in which perception and thought are indivisibly intertwined.Arnheim taught psychology at Sarah Lawrence College for twenty-six years. When Harvard established the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies in 1968  Arnheim was invited to join the faculty as Professor of the Psychology of Art. The appointment was also supported by the Departments of Psychology and Fine Arts. Arnheim taught at Harvard for six years before retiring in 1974. He then moved to Ann Arbor with his wife Mary and taught for ten more years as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan. Although his time at Harvard was comparatively short  his cross-disciplinary intellectual influence and his humanity were powerfully felt. Arnheim was a devoted teacher  always easy to approach and willing to spend time with his students. His large lecture course on “Perception and Expression in Art and Design” became the theoretical backbone of the department. It was usually oversubscribed  as was his advanced seminar on “Visual Thinking ” which attracted students from across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Arnheim was active in the American Society for Aesthetics and served twice as its president. For three terms he was president of the Division on Psychology and the Arts (a field which he practically invented) of the American Psychological Association. In 1976 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Despite being a firsthand witness to some of the most tragic moments of modern history and experiencing the personal sadness of outliving two wives and a daughter who died in childhood of Hodgkin’s disease  Rudi loved life and humanity. Almost to the end of his 102 years  he enjoyed reading  conversing  writing  sketching  listening to music  and playing his violin. He loved art  but never pursed the career of an artist. In 1989 Arnheim wrote  “[M]y life has been one of contemplation rather than of action; and since I watch the artists  who are contemplators  I am twice-removed from active life ‘perchè guardo quelli che guardano.’ I am…the little owl perched on the shoulder of Athene.”Respectfully submitted James AkermanEric RentschlerEduard SeklerD.

Brendan Maher  scholar  former GSAS dean  dies at 84,Brendan A. Maher  the Emeritus Edward C Henderson Professor of the Psychology of Personality in the Department of Psychology  died in his Durham  N.C.  home on March 17  at the age of 84.Maher  a highly regarded scholar in the field of schizophrenia  made extensive contributions to the empirical study of psychopathology and is regarded by many as the primary architect of a laboratory-based approach to the study of mental illness.Maher arrived at Harvard as a lecturer in 1960  leaving in 1964 to assume a professorship at the University of Wisconsin  Madison. He later served as dean of the faculty at Brandeis University  before returning to Harvard in 1972. During his long career  Maher taught Harvard undergraduate  graduate  and Extension School students; served as the chair of the Psychology Department on two occasions; and served as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.Maher  who will be remembered by many students and colleagues for his wisdom  humor  stories  and gentlemanly manner  is survived by his wife Winifred “Barbara” Brown Maher  five children  and five grandchildren.A memorial service is being planned for sometime in September.
Samuel H. Beer  Harvard scholar  dies at 97,Samuel Hutchison Beer  the distinguished Harvard political scientist  died in his sleep at the age of 97 on April 7.For years  Beer was the world’s leading expert in British politics  but he also studied the American political system  and was active in American politics as a lifelong Democrat and chairman of Americans for Democratic Action from 1959 to 1962.In 1944  Beer fought in the U.S. Army in Normandy  earning a Bronze Star; his peacetime hobbies included rock climbing and skydiving.Beer was born July 28  1911  in Bucyrus  Ohio  and graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.A. in 1932. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College  Oxford  from 1932 to 1935. He received his Ph.D. in political science in 1943 from Harvard. He married Roberta Frances Reed on June 22  1935.He worked on the staff of the Democratic National Committee and as occasional speechwriter for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 and 1936. He was a reporter for the New York Post in 1936 and 1937 and a writer at Fortune magazine in 1937 and 1938.After his wartime duty as captain in artillery  Beer served in the U.S. military government in Germany in 1945. While at Oxford he had traveled to Germany and noticed the rising threat of Nazism; after the war he was able to pursue his interest in the question of how so civilized a country  governed as a democracy  could lose so much.When he returned to Harvard to teach in 1946  he gave a course on that topic and became the leader of an approach to comparative government that made sense of facts through the ideas of political  social  and economic theory. He began a Harvard course  “Western Thought and Institutions ” that was as much history as political science  and as much political theory as comparative government. He continued this famous course for more than 30 years  to the benefit and admiration of thousands of Harvard students.Beer’s first book was “The City of Reason” (1949)  a study in the tradition of Oxford idealism that sees the reason inherent in human things rather than hovering above and critical of irrationalities. Avoiding the vague complacency of such a view  he launched the thorough study of British politics that made him celebrated in Britain as the man who knew British politics better than the British did. In 1965 he published the book that secured his reputation  “British Politics in the Collectivist Age ” combining an analysis of postwar British socialism with the hard facts of political parties and pressure groups.His study of American politics was crowned by the publication of his major work  “To Make a Nation: The Rediscovery of American Federalism ” in 1993. In it he stressed the original national purpose behind the idea of states’ rights  often abused to diminish the American nation.Always a partisan outside but never inside the classroom  Beer took a leading role in opposing the student rebellion of the late ’60s at Harvard  criticizing the politicization of universities. In 1998 he also criticized the politicization of impeachment  testifying to the House of Representatives in the case of President Bill Clinton.At Harvard  Beer served as the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government from 1971 and was chair of the Department of Government from 1954 to 1958. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1997. Retiring from Harvard in 1982  and with vitality intact  he moved to Boston College to become the first Thomas P. O’Neill Jr. Professor of American Politics  in part to honor his friend  the former speaker of the House of Representatives. Beer was also elected president of the American Political Science Association in 1977  and was made a fellow of the British Academy in 2000.Tributes from his Harvard colleagues emphasize his personal qualities.“His famous course Social Sciences 2 excited and nourished many thousands of minds ” says Stanley Hoffmann  the Buttenwieser University Professor at Harvard.“His teaching was memorable for the virtue he conveyed in it  and he was as manly a man as a professor can be ” added Harvey Mansfield  Beer’s former student and the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Government at Harvard.“A person of great moral as well as physical courage  Sam Beer displayed a greatness of spirit that made him larger than life ” said Peter Hall  Beer’s former student and the Krupp Foundation Professor of European Studies at Harvard.After the death of his first wife  Roberta  in 1987  Beer married Jane K. Brooks in 1989  who survives him. He is also survived by two daughters  Katherine Swingly Beer of Cambridge  Mass.  and Frances Fitzgerald Beer of Toronto; and by two stepdaughters  Alison Brooks of Washington  D.C.  and Camilla Brooks of New York City.  He also leaves six grandchildren  three step-grandchildren  and one great-grandchild. A son  William  died in 1991.
Morris Simon,Morris Simon  MB  BCH  died suddenly and unexpectedly on January 17  2005  one day after his 79th birthday. At the time of his death he was professor emeritus at Harvard Medical School and working regularly in the Department of Radiology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  as he had for almost a half century. Retirement was a non-kosher word for him  and when he became an emeritus professor in 1997 he continued his daily activities as a senior radiologist with practically unabated intensity  vigor and interest in research. At the end of his life he had succeeded with his own often declared wish “to die with his boots on!”.Dr. Simon was born in Johannesburg  South Africa in 1926. After attending Witwatersrand University and Medical School  Morris and his wife Josie moved to London in 1951 where he began his training in x-rays (the terms radiology and imaging were yet not in fashion)  becoming a senior registrar at Guys and at the Bromley Group Hospitals. It was in this position that he already at a young age made himself known internationally as an erudite chest radiologist. The in radiological circles legendary Dr. Felix Fleischner  head of Radiology at Beth Israel Hospital from 1942-1960  invited Morris to join him in his department and the radiologic faculty at the Harvard Medical School in Boston in 1958. Dr. Simon remained actively involved in that institution and the post-merger Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for the remainder of his life.Morris Simon had found in Dr. Fleischner a charismatic leader and soon became his right hand. He returned dedicated support and unfailing loyalty to his chief. He was instrumental in the preparation of a “Festschrift”  a collection of essays in honor of Dr. Fleischner in 1967 that attracted contributions from leading chest physicians from many disciplines and countries. It became the model for the well-known and still existing international chest scientific society  formed in 1969 and named in his name  shortly after his death in the same year. Dr. Simon was an organizer  founding member and president of the Fleischner Society. This was the first formal specialty society in Radiology and it served as the basis for virtually all of those that followed.In many ways Dr. Simon represented a bridge in Boston radiology from the era of Felix Fleischner  Richard Schatzki  Alice Ettinger and Larry Robbins  all practicing leaders in radiology at the different teaching hospitals  to the years when radiology developed via angiography  ultrasound technology  Ct and MRI into the modern clinical discipline that represents medical diagnostic imaging. Morris became acting and subsequently director of the BIH Radiology Department in 1960 and served as Radiologist-in-Chief 1963-1970. However  less attracted to the administrative responsibilities of such a position and more appropriate considering his keen interests and involvement in radiologic research and clinical teaching  he was appointed as the department’s Director of Clinical Services in 1970  a position he held until 1993.Morris Simon was foremost known as a chest radiologist who applied profound knowledge in circulatory physiology  vascular anatomy and rheologic mechanics to the interpretation of radiologic images  which in those days consisted of static radiographs and observations made on the fluoroscopic screen. One of his early publications proposed a theory that analysis of the appearance of lung vessels in chest x-ray films could detect incipient failure of the left heart. He had adopted the insight gained from circulatory experiments and incorporated them in the image analysis. Morris assumed that the lung vasculature of the patient in upright position would represent a water manometer reflecting the balance between existing pressure  flow and caliber of the blood vessels at different heights from the lung base up to the apical top while exposed to the air pressure that existed in the unobstructed airways. Knowing that the hydrostatic pressure competes with the low-pressure pulmonary circulation he explained the prominent blood flow through the dependent portions and explained the relative narrow appearance of lung vessels in the barely perfused apical areas. Even mild elevation of the left heart filling pressure  in the order of 5-10 mm/hg would dramatically change the upper lung vasculature  which now is distended fully  a phenomenon that can be identified before the stages of more severe failure with interstitial and alveolar edema develop. This description of this observation  later also known as “Upper Zone Redistribution” or “Cephalic Flow Diversion”  became a very important diagnostic concept to the modern oriented diagnostic radiologists who integrated knowledge of circulatory pathophysiology in the interpretation of static images.Dr. Simon was invited to join the evaluation panel for pulmonary angiograms in the first nationwide collaborative urokinase pulmonary embolism trial in the early 70’s. Realizing that this disease was most often a complication of thrombosis in the peripheral venous circulation  he made  perhaps his most important  contribution to clinical and experimental research when he conceived  developed and completed a vena cava filter device that made use of Nitinol  an alloy with thermal memory newly invented by NASA. This “memory metal”  made of an alloy of nickel and titanium  was originally created for aerospace applications. Depending on its composition and temperature  Nitinol can change its shape and Dr. Simon conceived of using this characteristic to permit percutaneous catheter introductions of a small caliber wire into the inferior vena cava  which  when extruded into the warmer body  would transform itself into a filter  assuming whatever shape and size had been previously established. The Simon-Nitinol Filter was subsequently modified into stents and a closure device for atrial septal defects. The Simon Vena Cava Filter is still among the most used devices of this kind today.Other medical technical approaches that attest to his innovative mind were the development of a catheter steering device that was successfully applied to perform peroral cannulation of the liver- and pancreatic-duct for diagnostic purposes. Noteworthy and appreciated by his surgical colleagues was the design of a localization wire for improved surgical approaches to small breast masses. Interventional radiologists benefited from his creation of a replication model of the human aorta so useful in the exploration and teaching avenues for complex selective vascular catheterization approaches.Still other medical innovations made by him included the Simon-Leeming medical Classification and its incorporation as the basis of the coded language information processing system (CLIP). The method was used in the whole institution  the Beth Israel Hospital  for many years and allowed retrieval of reported data based on anatomy  pathology and image findings. In this respect Morris was a visionary and at least 20 years ahead in the development of automated computer-based reporting systems  now a fundamental pillar in the organization of hospital based health care and epidemiologic research.Dr. Simon continued to make scientific contributions as a diagnostic pulmonary radiologist even as an emeritus professor. Technical innovations such as the Paddle-Wheel image display of the pulmonary vasculature when using CT. Morris logically merged his profound understanding of pulmonary anatomy with the technically determined image plane of the CT scanners and proposed and designed software programs that improved detection of small and localized vascular obstructions in pulmonary embolism. At the time of his death Dr. Simon was working on a device for semi-automatically dispensing multiple medications as a way of reducing errors  particularly in elderly individuals.In his closer professional environment all appreciated him as a most gentle  soft-spoken and always helpful friend and colleague. “I have never heard Dr. Simon to raise his voice in anger” is a quotation made by Dr. Mitchell T. Rabkin  the former president of the Institution. Such positive human qualities made him also a very successful and popular director of the department’s residency and student’s training program. Dr. Simon served as the Director of the Radiology Residency Training Program at BIH from 1964-1993. His remarkable contributions established agreement between New England radiology training programs to offer positions on a single day  which later led to the now well established matching program between all major academic training centers in the Nation. From 1971-1993 he was also director of the radiology clerkship for Harvard Medical Students at the BIH and from 1982-1993 chairman on radiologic education  a time at which radiologic imaging was playing an ever-increasing important role resulting in a one-month mandatory rotation in the Harvard curriculum.It would be a severe omission not to comment on Morris Simon’s extra professional accomplishments. To all his closer friends and those who had contacts with him he was known as a great humanitarian. Being born and raised in South Africa  Morris was exposed directly to the problems of human confrontation  injustices and discrimination. His compassion for the underdog  and in particular for the innocent victims of war  irrespectively on which side  was genuine and absolutely honest. The same holds for feelings about racial and gender discrimination. Friends and colleagues at the BIH and the Harvard Medical School will remember his courageous decision to make a trip to Hanoi in order to alleviate suffering and deliver medical support during the last years of the Vietnam conflict.Not widely known were his passionate interest and considerable accomplishments as a painter and sculptor. He shared deep interest in the arts together with his wife Josi and their four sons  Adam  Mark  Daniel and Jason. The whole Simon family was acknowledged as an anchor to the South African Diaspora and strong supporters of the art world in Boston. Morris was brilliant  generous and had an inner calm and peace.In January 2006  one year after Morris Simon’s death  the department of radiology at the BIDMC held  under the leadership of Herbert Y. Kressel  a memorial ceremony for Dr. Morris Simon in the attendance of his Wife and one of their son’s. The dedication of a most modern chest reading room as the “Simon Room”  containing not less than 6 modern computerized image display units  reflects the warm and respectful memory that all departments members share. His memory is also preserved in the department’s Paulin-Simon lectureship that supports an annual presentation of a scientific topic by a department member to be held at the radiology department at the Rambam Hospital  Tefchnion University in Haifa  Israel.Respectfully submitted Sven Paulin  chair Walter Abelmann Ferris M.

Nicolae Iliescu,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences December 9  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Son of Romania  student of Italy’s literature and culture  proud citizen of the United States  Nicolae Iliescu was all three  and each of these facets of his life experience helped to form the kind  erudite  and principled teacher who devoted his entire academic career to mentoring students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Iliescu was born in the village of Constantinesti  Romania. His father  a schoolteacher  also owned a farm where Iliescu helped with the daily chores. In later years he would say  only half in jest  that he was “a peasant at heart.” He had only begun his studies at the University of Bucharest when World War II broke out. Conscripted to fight for a regime he did not support  he served on the Russian front until the impending collapse of Nazi Germany and its Romanian sympathizers allowed him to escape into Austria. A series of fortuitous encounters with fellow refugees provided him with the means to travel  first  to Italy  where he earned a degree at the University of Padua  and then to America. He arrived in the United States in 1952  settling in Cleveland among its large Romanian population. Within a year he married and became the editor of a Romanian weekly newspaper called The Messenger. He was eventually to apply for admission to the Harvard Graduate School and in 1958 completed his Ph.D. in Italian with a dissertation on “The Italian Novel from Manzoni to Nievo.” The same year he was hired as an instructor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures  rising to the rank of full professor in 1968. He retired in 1989.Of the war years and Romania’s subsequent political vicissitudes  Iliescu did not like to speak  but their impact was sufficiently great to bring the colleague who worked most closely with him to write that “At the heart of the decisions he made in life lies a refusal to compromise in any way with the government that held sway in his native country.” In sharp contrast to that totalitarian regime stood the United States. Iliescu once told a prospective Harvard student  the son of a Romanian dissident  “[I]f you . . . can demonstrate integrity  leadership  and intellect  all doors are open  regardless of how you got into the United States or when.”Iliescu’s long peregrination toward a society where his talents might flourish offers interesting parallels to his most important scholarly work  a study of the influence of Saint Augustine on the Canzoniere of Petrarch. Although earlier scholars had already established resemblances between the saint and Petrarch  their research had focused on Petrarch’s letters and moral writings. In Il Canzoniere Petrarchesco e Sant’Agostino  Iliescu proposes that when the Italian poet recounts the story of his love for Laura  he is  in truth  like Augustine in his Confessions  relating a Christian’s struggle between earthly desires—often painstakingly explored in the text—and the quest to lead a purposeful  spiritual existence. For the numerous concrete examples of Augustine’s presence in the Canzoniere with which Iliescu buttresses his argument  the study was justly praised. Moreover  since these examples highlight stylistic as well as thematic material  the analysis was also recognized as giving new importance and depth to various features of Petrarch’s verse. “One of the most satisfying results of Professor Iliescu’s excellent study ” a reviewer wrote  “is that it helps us to see clearly that words and expressions that were frequently used rhetorically or lightly in the love lyric before Petrarch undergo a vital transformation in the Canzoniere.”Those inner struggles that Petrarch records in his Canzoniere resonated with Iliescu  whose deep faith and integrity had been sorely tested by the many dramas of his early life. A former doctoral student  reflecting on Iliescu’s teaching style and approach to literature  notes that for this professor “Literature was in a real  direct  and tangible way  about life—especially the moral choices life demands of us—and about how we are to make sense of it all. It is thus easy to understand why  above all  Dante’s Divine Comedy proved to be his favorite work  one that he taught for most of his nearly forty years in the department and that he continued to teach in the Harvard Extension School for several years even after his retirement.”His teaching and scholarship brought him honors from the Italian government  which awarded him the Premio della Cultura and the Medaglia della Cultura. He served as president of the Dante Society of America from 1972–79. Yet  we may believe that he appreciated no less the Festschrift that a group of past graduate students prepared for him at the time of his retirement. A gentleman of the old school  he could appear severe and reserved. In more private moments  however  he often revealed a fine sense of humor and considerable personal warmth which his students are quick to recall and laud. The affection was mutual. He made no secret of the sadness he felt when his teaching career ended. In consolation  he turned to his beloved Romania  which through his generosity and writing he tried to help recover from the long years of Communist domination.Nicolae Iliescu died of a heart attack on November 25  2007. He is survived by his wife Esther  two daughters  and brothers Octavian and Virgil.Respectfully submitted Dante Della TerzaFrancisco Márquez-VillanuevaDonald Stone  Chair
Business School’s Marshall dies at 86,Harvard Business School (HBS) ProfessorEmeritusMartin V. Marshall  a driving force in the development of the School’s Owner/President Management Program (OPM) for entrepreneurs and a marketing and advertising expert whose practice-oriented approach to teaching and course development left a lasting impact on countless Harvard M.B.A. students and business leaders  died on Feb. 16 in Napa  Calif. He was 86 years old.“Marty Marshall was a terrific teacher ” said Stephen A. Greyser  the School’s Richard P. Chapman Professor of Business Administration Emeritus  who was an M.B.A. student of Marshall’s and then a longtime friend and colleague. “Marty would home in on the topic at hand and not let students wiggle or wriggle off their previous statements ” Greyser remembered. “He pursued the point by pressing the students  but without being mean-spirited.” Marshall joined the HBS faculty in 1949 and was later named the first Henry R. Byers Professor of Business Administration. He retired from the active faculty in 1993.He produced some 200 cases and teaching notes as well as several books  including “Automatic Merchandising” and “Cases in Advertising Management.” He was best known for his work with OPM  where he had a loyal following among generations of entrepreneurs. Many OPM participants kept in touch with him long after they had graduated  often seeking his advice on difficult business decisions.Marshall began teaching in OPM in the late 1970s  when it was known as the Smaller Company Management Program (SCMP). As program head  he changed the curriculum after noticing that participants no longer represented just small companies  but firms that might be multimillion-dollar enterprises. He also helped devise a unique schedule spread over three years and changed the name of the program to reflect the common thread among participants — their role as both owners and managers.Marshall’s career was varied and full at HBS and beyond. He taught in almost every educational program at the School  including the Advanced Management Program for senior executives. He also initiated major on-campus executive education programs in marketing management — two for advertising and broadcasting professional organizations and the third catering to international businesspeople. “He provided a terrific linkage to the world of advertising and marketing ” noted Greyser.To expand his global view of business  Marshall worked with management schools in Europe  Japan  India  Mexico  and Australia. In addition  he led several important policymaking committees and was on the faculty of the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration (HRPBA)  a one-year graduate program for women taught by HBS professors at Radcliffe College until 1963. At the urging of his first wife  the late Rosanne Borden (herself an HRPBA graduate)  he spearheaded the effort in the 1960s to make the two-year M.B.A. program at HBS coeducational.When Marshall first came to HBS in 1943 as part of his U.S. Navy training  he had no intention of remaining for any length of time. An avid history buff who had read most of his college history texts while still in high school  he had intended to pursue a career in law.But service in World War II intervened. After enlisting in the Navy  he was sent to officers school at Columbia University  then reassigned to HBS  where he completed the first year of the M.B.A. program before going on active duty from 1944 to 1946. “Having been in lecture classes in college  I was astonished by the way HBS professors conducted case discussions. It was my first true experience in thinking — and I loved it ” he remarked with characteristic candor.Marshall’s management experience in military logistics and supply persuaded him to return to Harvard to complete his M.B.A. when the war ended. Earning his degree in 1947  he was asked to stay on at the School as a case writer in marketing  working with seminal HBS marketing faculty such as Melvin Copeland  Malcolm McNair  and Pete Borden. When Borden became ill unexpectedly (and eventually took a leave of absence)  he asked Marshall to teach his advertising class — a responsibility not normally entrusted to a case writer. Marshall embraced the challenge  and buoyed by the experience  embarked on a doctorate at the School  which he completed in 1953.Martin Vivan Marshall was born on July 22  1922  in Kansas City  Mo. He gained his first exposure to the basic principles of marketing while working as a stock boy at a Safeway grocery store. “In 1939  one of Safeway’s five milk suppliers offered me a few dollars a week to keep restocking his milk on the right side of the display case ” Marshall remembered. “When the milk kept moving out of the right side but not the left  I realized the supplier simply recognized that most people reach with their right hand to grab the closest bottle. That’s when I first became intrigued with human behavior and how it can be influenced — and with the basic concept of marketing.”Marshall received a Distinguished Service Award from HBS in 1998 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the School and the field of business education. The citation accompanying the award read in part: “You have provided people with directions for success in business and in life. Magnificent motivator and mentor  you have taught us all that education for executives should know no end.”Marshall was a consultant to several multinational corporations  including Sears Roebuck  Wal-Mart  Bank of America  and American Express. He also served on the board of Youth Services International  which provides care and developmental services for at-risk youth.In addition to his wife  Hildegard Doherty  Marshall is survived by his sister  Marietta Siegrist  of Overland Park  Kan.; three sons and two daughters-in-law  Martin D. Marshall and his wife  Debra Terzian  of Sudbury  Mass.  Michael Marshall and his wife  Susan  of North Salem  N.Y.  and Neil Marshall of Waltham  Mass.; two grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.Burial will be private. A memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers  memorial gifts may be made to the Professor Neil H. Borden-Rosanne Borden Marshall Financial Aid Fund  c/o Kerry Cietanno  Harvard Business School  Boston  MA 02163.
Elliot Forbes,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences December 9  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Elliot Forbes  Fanny Peabody Professor of Music emeritus  died January 10  2006  at the age of 88 at his home in his native city of Cambridge  Massachusetts. The descendant of a Boston Brahmin family  he had deep roots at Harvard University  going all the way back to Ralph Waldo Emerson  a great-grandfather. His father  Edward Waldo Forbes  was an art historian and director of the Fogg Museum. Elliot  affectionately known as El  was born August 30  1917  and grew up in Cambridge. After attending Shady Hill and Milton Academy  he received the A.B. from Harvard College in 1941.After college  El Forbes first taught at secondary schools before returning to Harvard in 1945 as a graduate student. He earned the A.M. degree in 1947. Professor Walter Piston  the noted composer  was one of his principal teachers. While a graduate student  Forbes served Professor G. Wallace Woodworth “Woody” as assistant conductor of the Glee Club. Choral conducting really was his passion  and it became his profession and primary function when in 1951 he was appointed director of the Princeton Glee Club. He taught at Princeton University for eleven years before returning to Harvard in 1958 to become conductor of the Glee Club and the Radcliffe Choral Society.Following in the footsteps of Woody and the Glee Club’s first conductor  Archibald T. “Doc” Davison  El prepared the Choral Society and Glee Club for their annual performance with the Boston Symphony Orchestra—what became more than a fifty-year-old tradition. As conductor of the Glee Club and the Radcliffe Choral Society he also toured extensively throughout the world and trained a generation of conductors  among them William Christie  founder and director of the baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants of Paris.As he had contracted polio in 1951  which mildly affected his conducting ever since  he decided to step down from his conducting post in 1970. In the following years he focused primarily on undergraduate teaching. His Music 2  dealing with basic principles of elementary composition through exercises in writing and analysis  became his signature course. There he taught many an enthusiastic non-concentrator how to engage in musical fantasies  invent sensible musical ideas  and work them out according to sound principles.Professor Forbes chaired the Music Department from 1972 to 1976 and became anemeritusprofessor eight years later  in 1984. That year also saw the publication of a festschrift  Beethoven Essays: Studies in Honor of Elliot Forbes  edited by Lewis Lockwood and Phyllis Benjamin. Harvard awarded him the Alumni Medal in 1991 and an honorary doctorate in 2003.As a scholar Forbes is best known for his revision and critical annotations of Alexander Wheelock Thayer’s Life of Beethoven  originally published in three volumes  1866–1879. Also a Bostonian and a Harvard alumnus  who graduated in the class of 1841  exactly a century before Forbes  Thayer had written the first authoritative biography of Beethoven. It had long become a true classic in the field and continues to retain its status thanks to Forbes’s revised edition of 1964.Besides editing the Harvard-Radcliffe Choral Music Series and publishing a number of scholarly articles El Forbes wrote two sequels to Walter Spalding’s 1935 book Music at Harvard  the first A History of Music at Harvard to 1972  the second A Report of Music at Harvard from 1972 to 1990. El Forbes  the quintessential Harvard man and himself deeply rooted in the university’s history  always felt a very deep commitment not only to furthering the institution’s progress but also to recording it.El Forbes continued to be a steady presence at Harvard for the more than twenty years of his retirement right up to his death. He regularly attended concerts given by the undergraduate student groups  joined the long table at the Faculty Club (for as long as it was there)  and in nearly half a century rarely missed Morning Prayers in Appleton Chapel. A much-loved figure on and off campus  El Forbes was  as the Reverend Peter Gomes so fittingly put it at his memorial service  “a man always preceded by his smile.”The day after graduation in 1941  El Forbes married Kathleen Brooks Allen  then a Radcliffe graduate student. She survives him  as does his sister  Anne Forbes of Groton  Massachusetts. Kay and El Forbes had three daughters  Diana Forbes Droste of Watertown  Massachusetts; Barbara Forbes Purser of Skye  Scotland; and Susan Forbes Johnson of Plymouth  Massachusetts; as well as four grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.Respectfully submitted Thomas Forrest KellyLewis LockwoodJameson MarvinChristoph Wolff  Chair
Dunster House composer-in-residence ‘Charley’ Kletzsch dies at 82,Charles F. “Charley” Kletzsch  Dunster House composer-in-residence for more than 50 years  died Jan. 15.Kletzsch was a well-known fixture at Harvard  recognized for his inspiring and unusual way of life. Born in Milwaukee on April 4  1926  Kletzsch entered Harvard College when he was just 16. He left college life to pursue music at the conservatory level  but returned five years later to complete his A.B. in 1951  after which he moved into Dunster House as a librarian. After earning an A.M. in music in 1953  Kletzsch remained at Dunster as a tutor before being named composer-in-residence. Shunned by his family for wasting his time with music  he lived in a small “secret room” in the Dunster House library  subsisting on a yearly salary of $1 000 until around his 40th birthday when he was bequeathed money by relatives.With newfound monetary freedom  Kletzsch indulged his love of travel — yet he always returned to Harvard. In a 1990 interview with The Harvard Crimson  he said  “I sat down to write a poem at the Alhambra in Granada  and what I wrote about was the students of Dunster House.”“He used to pick out students to read his poetry at concerts ” recalls Andrew Goodridge ’93. “I remember him saying to them  ‘If the Royal Shakespeare Company offered to read these poems  I would say no  because I want you guys to read them.’”Kletzsch retired from Dunster House in 2002. During his farewell ceremony  former students and friends remarked on his life’s achievements — how  for example  he was spurred to take up the cello  though he was 65 at the time.“His goal was only to play ‘simple phrases beautifully ’” says Goodridge.“He was thoughtful and gentle ” recalls Betty McNally ’86  former Dunster House administrator. “Dapper ” she adds  remembering his Lucite cane.Goodridge recalls visiting Kletzsch in the nursing home and playing Mozart sonatas. “Whenever possible  we would take a walk outside ” he says. “He was fascinated with nature and would stop to look at every flower  every leaf. That’s what was so special about Charley  he found beauty in things that the rest of the world seemed to overlook.”This fascination sustained Kletzsch throughout his life — even during the frugal years; he told the Harvard Crimson. “I learned that only two things really matter: love and beauty.”A service for Kletzsch was held on Jan. 20.
Samuel Huntington  81  political scientist  scholar,Samuel P. Huntington – a longtime Harvard University professor  an influential political scientist  and mentor to a generation of scholars in widely divergent fields – died Dec. 24 on Martha’s Vineyard. He was 81.Huntington had retired from active teaching in 2007  following 58 years of scholarly service at Harvard. In a retirement letter to the President of Harvard  he wrote  in part  “It is difficult for me to imagine a more rewarding or enjoyable career than teaching here  particularly teaching undergraduates. I have valued every one of the years since 1949.”Huntington  the father of two grown sons  lived in Boston and on Martha’s Vineyard. He was the author  co-author  or editor of 17 books and over 90 scholarly articles. His principal areas of research and teaching were American government  democratization  military politics  strategy  and civil-military relations  comparative politics  and political development.“Sam was the kind of scholar that made Harvard a great university ” said Huntington’s friend of nearly six decades  economist Henry Rosovsky  who is Harvard’s Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor  Emeritus. “People all over the world studied and debated his ideas. I believe that he was clearly one of the most influential political scientists of the last 50 years.”“Every one of his books had an impact ” said Rosovsky. “These have all become part of our vocabulary.”Jorge Dominguez  Harvard’s vice provost for International Affairs  described Huntington as “one of the giants of political science worldwide during the past half century. He had a knack for asking the crucially important but often inconvenient question. He had the talent and skill to formulate analyses that stood the test of time.”Huntington’s friend and colleague Robert Putnam  the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School  called him “one of the giants of American intellectual life of the last half century.”To Harvard College Professor Stephen P. Rosen  Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs  “Samuel Huntington’s brilliance was recognized by the academics and statesmen around the world who read his books. But he was loved by those who knew him well because he combined a fierce loyalty to his principles and friends with a happy eagerness to be confronted with sharp opposition to his own views.”Huntington  who graduated from Yale College at age 18 and who was teaching at Harvard by age 23  was best known for his views on the clash of civilizations. He argued that in a post-Cold War world  violent conflict would come not from ideological friction between nation states  but from cultural and religious differences among the world’s major civilizations.Huntington  who was the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor at Harvard  identified these major civilizations as Western (including the United States and Europe)  Latin American  Islamic  African  Orthodox (with Russia as a core state)  Hindu  Japanese  and “Sinic” (including China  Korea  and Vietnam).“My argument remains ” he said in a 2007 interview with Islamica Magazine  “that cultural identities  antagonisms and affiliations will not only play a role  but play a major role in relations between states.”Huntington first advanced his argument in an oft-cited 1993 article in the journal Foreign Affairs. He expanded the thesis into a book  “The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order ” which appeared in 1996  and has since been translated into 39 languages.To the end of his life  the potential for conflict inherent in culture was prominent in Huntington’s scholarly pursuits. In 2000  he was co-editor of “Culture Matters: How Values Shape Human Progress.” And just before his health declined  in the fall of 2005  he was beginning to explore religion and national identity.“His contributions ranged across the whole field of political science  from the deeply theoretical to the intensely applied ” said Putnam  author of a lengthy appreciation of Huntington in a 1986 issue of the journal PS: Political Science and Politics. “Over the years  he mentored a large share of America’s leading strategic thinkers  and he built enduring institutions of intellectual excellence.”And Putnam added a personal note. “What was most rare about Sam  however  was his ability to combine intensely held  vigorously argued views with an engaging openness to contrary evidence and argument. Harvard has lost a towering figure  and his colleagues have lost a very good friend.”Timothy Colton  the Morris and Anna Feldberg Professor of Government and Russian Studies at Harvard  remarked on his old friend’s breadth of intellectual interests. He used the American political experience as a pivot point (Huntington’s doctoral dissertation was on the Interstate Commerce Commission)  but soon deeply studied a globe-spanning range of topics.“He was anchored in American life and his American identity  but he ended up addressing so many broad questions ” said Colton  who had Huntington as a Ph.D. adviser at Harvard in the early 1970s. “His degree of openness to new topics and following questions where they take him is not as often found today as when he was making his way.”Huntington’s first book  “The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations ” published to great controversy in 1957 and now in its 15th printing  is today still considered a standard title on the topic of how military affairs intersect with the political realm. It was the subject of a West Point symposium last year  on the 50th anniversary of its publication.In part  “Soldier and the State” was inspired by President Harry Truman’s firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur – and at the same time praised corps of officers that in history remained stable  professional  and politically neutral.In 1964  he co-authored  with Zbigniew Brzezinski  “Political Power: USA-USSR ” which was a major study of Cold War dynamics – and how the world could be shaped by two political philosophies locked in opposition to one another.Brzezinski  a doctoral student at Harvard in the early 1950s who was befriended by both Huntington and Rosovsky  was U.S. National Security Adviser in the Carter White House from 1977 to 1981. In those days  said Rosovsky  the youthful Huntington  though an assistant professor  was often mistaken for an undergraduate.According to his wife Nancy  Huntington was a life-long Democrat  and served as foreign policy adviser to Vice President Hubert Humphrey in his 1968 presidential campaign. In the wake of that “bitter” campaign  she said  Huntington and Warren Manshel – “political opponents in the campaign but close friends” – co-founded the quarterly journal Foreign Policy (now a bimonthly magazine). He was co-editor until 1977.His 1969 book  “Political Order in Changing Societies ” is widely regarded as a landmark analysis of political and economic development in the Third World. It was among Huntington’s most influential books  and a frequently assigned text for graduate students investigating comparative politics  said Dominguez  who is also Antonio Madero Professor of Mexican and Latin American Politics and Economics. The book “challenged the orthodoxies of the 1960s in the field of development ” he said. “Huntington showed that the lack of political order and authority were among the most serious debilities the world over. The degree of order  rather than the form of the political regime  mattered most.”His 1991 book  “The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century” – another highly influential work – won the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order  and “looked at similar questions from a different perspective  namely  that the form of the political regime – democracy or dictatorship – did matter ” said Dominguez. “The metaphor in his title referred to the cascade of dictator-toppling democracy-creating episodes that peopled the world from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s  and he gave persuasive reasons for this turn of events well before the fall of the Berlin Wall.”As early as the 1970s  Huntington warned against the risk of new governments becoming politically liberalized too rapidly. He proposed instead that governments prolong a transition to full democracy – a strand of ideas that began with an influential 1973 paper  “Approaches to Political Decompression.”Huntington’s most recent book was “Who Are We? The Challenges of America’s National Identity” (2004)  a scholarly reflection on America’s cultural sense of itself.Samuel Phillips Huntington was born on April 18  1927  in New York City. He was the son of Richard Thomas Huntington  an editor and publisher  and Dorothy Sanborn Phillips  a writer.Huntington graduated from Stuyvesant High School  received his B.A. from Yale in 1946  served in the U.S. Army  earned an M.A. from the University of Chicago in 1948  and a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1951  where he had taught nearly without a break since 1950.From 1959 to 1962  he was associate director of the Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. At Harvard  he served two tenures as the chair of the Government Department – from 1967 to 1969 and from 1970 to 1971.Huntington served as president of the American Political Science Association from 1986 to 1987.Huntington was director of Harvard’s Center for International Affairs from 1978 to 1989. He founded the John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies  and was director there from 1989 to 1999. He was chairman of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies from 1996 to 2004  and was succeeded by Jorge Dominguez.Huntington applied his theoretical skills to the Washington  D.C.  arena too. In 1977 and 1978  he served in the Carter White House as coordinator of security planning for the National Security Council. In the 1980s  he was a member of the Presidential Commission on Long-Term Integrated Strategy.Huntington is survived by his wife of 51 years  Nancy Arkelyan Huntington; by his sons Nicholas Phillips Huntington of Newton  Mass. and Timothy Mayo Huntington of Boston; by his daughters-in-law Kelly Brown Huntington and Noelle Lally Huntington; and by his four grandchildren.There will be a private family burial service on Martha’s Vineyard  where Huntington summered for 40 years.In the spring  there will be a memorial service at Harvard. Details are pending.
Wilga Marie Rivers,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences October 21  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Wilga Marie Rivers was born on April 13  1919  in Melbourne  Australia. She remained in her native country for the early years of her education and obtained a B.A. honors degree from the University of Melbourne in 1939. An M.A. from the same university followed in 1949. Rivers would eventually come to the United States to complete her graduate work and earn a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1962. Twelve years later she joined the Harvard faculty as a full professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures  the first woman to hold that title. At the time of her appointment  Rivers had already established herself as an international authority on language learning and teaching  having taken her field beyond the behaviorist methodology of the 1960s and offered in its stead a new psycholinguistic approach to foreign language pedagogy. Throughout her career she would work tirelessly to make contributions to the field of applied linguistics and to the professionalization of language teachers at every level.Her first book  The Psychologist and the Foreign-Language Teacher  published in 1964  won notice as a result of its exploration of the relationship between the psychological processes of language acquisition and the rationale on which a specific methodology is based. While acknowledging the necessity of “making foreign language responses automatic at the manipulative level ” Rivers challenges the basic assumptions of the audio-lingual method (ALM) prevalent at the time and emphasizes the emotional  or affective  component of foreign language learning as well as the need to make material meaningful. Here  as in later books  Rivers focuses on the individual learner  criticizing ALM’s assumption that all students learn in the same way and that it is possible to learn a foreign language through repetition and drill without the expression of personal meaning. Her last chapter  consisting of recommendations for the teacher  represents a constant in Rivers’ writing: the desire to combine scholarly research and practical application in order to ensure that classroom practices rest on a sound theoretical foundation.Teaching Foreign-Language Skills  perhaps Rivers’ most important contribution to the field of applied linguistics  was published in 1968 and subsequently translated into Japanese  Romanian  and Portuguese. In addition  special editions were prepared for use by teachers in India  Pakistan  and Southeast Asia. A later revision completed in 1981 was also translated into Japanese. This book  even more than The Psychologist and the Foreign-Language Teacher  demonstrates her ability to identify and synthesize the multiple studies and theories of language and learning. It presents an exhaustive discussion of the four basic skills of listening  speaking  reading  and writing; as well as chapters on various methodologies and theories  on sounds and phonetics  technology  and cultural understanding. Little wonder that an editor at the University of Chicago Press  in writing to Rivers about the possibility of distributing the new 1981 edition  referred to the work as “the bible” of foreign language teaching.In the many tributes Rivers received over the years  her leadership and helpfulness are invariably mentioned. A former graduate student expressed a sentiment shared by many: “I have always been thankful to Wilga for her confidence in students  her unwavering support  and her generosity.” Rivers was also an equally dedicated mentor to younger colleagues in the language section of the Department  distributing articles on new or interesting approaches to language teaching  proposing these colleagues as conference speakers and  in general  inspiring them to improve their courses and their teaching. Unselfish in her support of the non-ladder language faculty  she included them as chapter authors in two of the volumes she edited. These efforts often extended beyond her department and even Harvard. Most notably  she created Sine Nomine  a group of college language teachers in the Boston area who gathered four times a year to discuss specific topics and profit from the opportunity to exchange ideas  to network  and to gain experience in making presentations.Wilga Rivers’ name was not associated with any specific language teaching methodology. Just as she felt that students’ individual differences and learning styles should be recognized  so she believed that teachers needed to adapt pedagogical approaches to their own personalities. This belief was due  at least in part  to her experiences as a student. When growing up in Melbourne in the 1920s and 1930s in an environment limited by means and geography  she was awed by the ability of a French teacher to motivate her students in the study of a remote culture and its language. In the first installment of her memoirs  Down Under/Up Top  Rivers asks: “How then did this young teacher arouse such enthusiasm for what to us was an esoteric subject? … [S]he loved young people and she loved teaching… [W]hen I started teaching French myself  I had in my memory a wonderful model that I wanted to emulate.”Rivers’ success spread well beyond the world of the school teacher who inspired her. She wrote approximately eighty articles on language teaching and learning and was the author  co-author  or editor of fifteen books  including a series of “practical guides” for the teaching of English  French  German  Hebrew  and Spanish. She was an invited or keynote speaker in over forty countries  even long after her retirement. Active in professional organizations  notably as the first president of the American Association for Applied Linguistics  Rivers received many prizes  served on a variety of advisory councils  consulted for both the Canadian and United States government  and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Middlebury.Wilga Rivers suffered a severe stroke in July 2005 and died on June 23  2007. She will be sorely missed by her many friends and colleagues throughout the world and by the profession she served with such unstinting devotion.Respectfully Submitted Elvira Di FabioDonald StoneJudith Frommer  Chair

Mortimer John Buckley,Mortimer John Buckley was born July 1  1932 in Worcester  Massachusetts to an Irish immigrant family from near Killarney. Mort attended the College of the Holy Cross and then Boston University Medical School  later being named a distinguished alumnus of both schools.Dr. Buckley did all of his surgical training at the Massachusetts General Hospital. During his general surgical residency  he spent two years participating in a clinical and research fellowship in the Clinic of Heart Surgery at the National Institutes of Health  where he worked with Dr. Andrew Glenn Morrow. Dr. Buckley returned to the MGH to complete his surgical training  finishing in 1966. He immediately joined the cardiac surgical staff at the MGH and the faculty at HMS  and remained with these institutions for the rest of his professional career until his retirement in 1998. During that career  he also helped to initiate or expand cardiac surgical programs at the Beth Israel Hospital  Mount Auburn Hospital  University of Massachusetts in Worcester  and University of Athens  Greece.Dr. Mortimer J. Buckley  MJB to those on the cardiac surgical service at the Massachusetts General Hospital  and Mort to his friends  was a cardiac surgical legend and a complex personality. Until his final illness  he was physically imposing  could be intellectually and professionally intimidating  and socially charming. The timing of Mortimer Buckley’s life  what he inherited from his parents and the skills he developed placed him in the enviable position of having the privilege and the capacity to be one of the true pioneers who helped to guide the rapid growth of cardiac surgery as a specialty.Professionally Mortimer Buckley combined raw intelligence  a prodigious memory  great technical facility  tenacity in the care of patients  an unbelievable work ethic  and absolute dedication to teaching with an inability to accept anything less than the complete commitment of his residents to learning and the total dedication of the staff to the welfare of the patients. For over thirty years he was relentless in his devotion to teaching residents to become cardiac surgeons and equally demanding in what he expected in return. While Mort could make accommodations for lesser degrees of intelligence or native surgical skills  he accepted nothing less than a resident’s absolute best efforts to try to be perfect – no cutting corners  no half-hearted attempts  only total involvement. Mort abhorred wasted talent.As a teacher  Mort Buckley was in part a product of his times  and  therefore  a demanding taskmaster. He would have been comfortable with Vince Lombardi  legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers  who said  “Success demands singleness of purpose.” Mort would also have understood Coach Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant of the University of Alabama  who said  “I make my practices real hard because if a player is a quitter  I want him to quit in practice.” As his residents quickly learned  Dr. Buckley was an intense competitor. In cardiac surgery he had to be; his opponent was death. In the care of patients Mortimer Buckley only played to win.While the operating room could be a tough learning ground  the rewards were invaluable. Residents learned a consistent  reliable  tested and safe approach to even the most complex cardiac surgical pathologies  and were assisted in doing a lot of operations  as long as they did them his way. While the atmosphere in Mort’s operating room could be intense  to most of his chief residents  he became a mentor  occasionally to some who did not get the message  a tormentor. Despite the intensity of training  during Dr. Buckley’s over twenty-five years as Chief of the Cardiac Surgical Unit  the residency was always over-subscribed. Over 70 cardiac surgeons were graduates of his training program  many of whom went on to be professors and Chiefs of their own cardiac surgical training programs. At a retirement dinner held in his honor  69 of his trainees were present as a measure of their loyalty to and appreciation of Mort.As Chief of the MGH Cardiac Surgical Unit  Dr. Buckley was a leader who had a vision for MGH cardiac surgery. He would confront cardiology  nursing  anesthesia  the department of surgery  the hospital administration  the state government or anyone else if he felt that it would benefit the MGH cardiac surgical program. In that process MJB earned  in turn  the loyalty of operating room nurses  perfusionists and cardiac intensive care and floor nurses  scores of who remained on the service for decades to work alongside Dr. Buckley and the rest of the team. The intensity of life on the cardiac surgical service was frequently broken with humor and good times. People worked hard and played hard. A defined mission and shared sense of purpose bred camaraderie.As a colleague  Dr. Buckley set a high standard of performance and expectation. His work ethic  excellent results and commitment to teaching set a valuable example for the rest of the staff. Although like all surgeons in high-pressure specialties  Mort could be on occasion difficult in day-to-day interactions  when a major problem developed  particularly for a colleague  no one was more effective than Mort at facing complex situations and resolving problems.As a surgeon  MJB was unflappable in the face of any cardiac surgical problem. He was equally comfortable managing the most difficult valvular  coronary  aortic or even congenital cases. Although he was an early leader in the field of myocardial revascularization  coronary artery bypass grafting was not Mort’s favorite operation. He was much happier with complex valvular or aortic cases  although he felt that his greatest reward lay in helping an infant achieve a chance at longer life. He was an excellent technician  a master at managing cardiac physiology and a genius at getting out of trouble.As a scientist  Dr. Buckley was an early innovator in the application of mechanical circulatory support  contributing to the development of the intra-aortic balloon pump and its clinical application to treat acutely ischemic and failing hearts. Along with his colleagues of that time  particularly Eldred Mundth and Willard Daggett  under the guidance of W. Gerald Austen  he pioneered the surgical treatment of cardiogenic shock and the mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction.Although much of Dr. Buckley’s innovative efforts were focused on treating coronary artery disease and its complications  he was equally comfortable with managing even the most complex valvular  aortic and congenital cardiac pathologies. Along with colleagues in cardiac anesthesia  he helped to establish the technique of deep hypothermia and hemodilution for the correction of congenital anomalies in infants. His bibliography of over 200 published articles spans the entire gamut of adult and congenital heart disease.As a young surgeon  Mort Buckley made important contributions to the cardiac surgical literature  but in his later years unfortunately he could not motivate himself to write about the lessons learned from thirty years of practice. Today his wisdom resides in the minds and hearts of the residents that he taught and continues to be passed to succeeding generations of residents taught by his pupils.Dr. Buckley served as Chief of the Cardiac Surgery Unit at MGH from 1970 through 1998  during which he enjoyed a distinguished career as Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and was a recipient of the American Heart Association’s prestigious Paul Dudley White Award and of the Abraham Colles Medal from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In 1995 Dr. Buckley was elected president of the prestigious American Association for Thoracic Surgery for his contributions to the specialty.Numerous cardiac surgeons around the globe invited Dr. Buckley to visit their programs to impart his knowledge and expand their understanding. Not only did he mentor surgeons in operating rooms from China to Venezuela  but his international residents from Greece to Korea brought their surgical skills  honed under his tutelage  back to their own countries to improve cardiac care.Outside of medicine one could see a different personal side to Mort Buckley  including his ability to be the world’s most charming raconteur. He had a well-honed Irish sense of humor and loved to tell stories. When not in the operating room  Mort Buckley enjoyed tennis and golf  but was his happiest out at sea  sailing with his family. As a host  he was kind  generous and deferential.Mort Buckley was totally devoted to his family. He adored Marilyn  his wife of forty-five years  who unfailingly supported him through the countless long days and late nights required to build and sustain a premier cardiac surgical program in Boston. Mort took immense pride in the success of his children – Kathleen  Deirdre  Kara and Tim. For all of the joy he gained from their accomplishments  he was even more proud of the people they had become. In later years Mort equally loved his ten grandchildren and their diverse personalities.Several years after retiring Mort acquired multiple myeloma. That terrible disease cut short a well-earned retirement  made his last years difficult and his last months painful. His courage in the face of those trials provided further inspiration and life lessons to his friends and pupils. Dr. Buckley died on November 24  2007 at the age of 75 in his home in Osterville on Cape Cod. His funeral service was celebrated at Christ the King Church  a large Catholic church on Cape Cod before a filled sanctuary. It was right and proper  no matter what their individual religious preference  that hundreds of Dr. Buckley’s friends gathered in a Catholic Church to celebrate the life of Mortimer J. Buckley. Throughout his life  Mort’s religion was very important to him; he was a Knight of Malta  a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre and a lifelong supporter of the Church. Mort once told one of his daughters that if he had not instilled in her the importance of her religious faith  then he had failed as a parent.During the height of Dr. Buckley’s career he was often described as being “larger than life.” Considering the success of his family  the scores of cardiac surgeons he trained who have gone on to great accomplishment and their continued dissemination of his teachings; we might argue that Dr. Mortimer J. Buckley’s legacy is even larger than death.Respectfully submitted Cary W. Akins  chairperson W. Gerald Austen Willard M. Daggett  Jr. Bruce W. Lytle
Distinguished mathematician Andrew Gleason dies at 86,Andrew Gleason  professoremeritusof the Mathematics Department  perhaps best known for his contribution to solving Hilbert’s Fifth problem  died Oct. 17 of complications following surgery. He was 86. Shing-Tung Yau  chair of the department  said  “Andrew was a great mathematician who solved many important problems in mathematics. He also provided a great service to the University as chairman of the Society of Fellows and as chairman of the department for a period of time. One-time president of the American Mathematics Society  he was a leader of the world’s math community. He trained countless graduate students  and proved an inspiration to them and others.”Born in Fresno  Calif.  Andrew Mattei Gleason moved with his family to New York while he was in high school. After graduating from Yale University in 1942  he enlisted in the Navy and served as a cryptanalyst during World War II  seeking to break Japanese and German codes. He re-enlisted in 1950 and served as a code breaker in the Korean War for three years.“Many mathematicians were code breakers  because it took a mathematical mind ” said his wife Jean Berko Gleason  whom he married in 1959.In 1946  Gleason was appointed a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows  a select group of young scholars who are given three-year fellowships to pursue their studies without formal requirements at Harvard.During this period  Gleason set about solving Hilbert’s Fifth  a problem that mathematician David Hilbert formulated in 1900. Gleason solved a key aspect of the problem with three others  winning the Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1952.By solving the problem  Gleason and his team made a tremendous advance in the understanding of symmetries  which are the basis of Hilbert’s Fifth  said Clifford H. Taubes  former chair of the Mathematics Department.“His biggest contribution was to solve this problem ” said Taubes. “Solving the problem said things were simpler than they could have been. Now [other mathematicians] … can focus on other parts of symmetry.”In 1969  Gleason was named the Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy  an endowed chair at Harvard.He served as head fellow of the Society of Fellows  helping select junior fellows from 1989 to 1996. He taught mathematics at Harvard until he retired in 1992.Gleason also worked on developing new mathematics curricula for students  particularly calculus courses. He was concerned with how children learn  as well.“He loved working with children; he was always engaged in math curriculum reform. He was interested in how children thought. He wanted children to understand how mathematics worked ” Jean Gleason said.Gerhard Gade University Professor Barry Mazur said of his longtime colleague  “His ardent interest in basic things — in things that really matter — his intellectual generosity  and the clarity of his thought  made a deep impression on everyone who knew him.”Shlomo Sternberg  the George Putnam Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics  recalled Gleason warmly: “Andrew Gleason was a world famous mathematician by the mid-1950s. Among mathematicians he was famous for his contribution to the solution of Hilbert’s Fifth problem. Among theoretical physicists and philosophers concerned with the foundations of quantum mechanics  he was famous for ‘Gleason’s theorem ’ elucidating a key point in quantum logic.“So when my wife  Aviva  and I arrived at Harvard in 1959  we were a bit in awe of him. But Jean and Andy Gleason were very warm and kind to us over these many years  and we frequently turned to them for sagacious advice. Andy had a very broad range of interests including mathematics education at a national level. We will miss him  and we extend our sympathies to Jean and to their daughters.”Among his many interests  Gleason had a passion for astronomy. “He loved looking at the stars. He knew every star in the sky and could tell you their names ” Jean Gleason said. “Early on  he was planning on becoming an astronomer but then he learned how cold it was” to sit outside and watch.In 2006  Gleason sailed along the coast of Turkey to see a solar eclipse and also traveled to the United Kingdom  France  and Kenya to view celestial events.In addition to his wife  Gleason leaves three daughters: Katherine of New York  Pam of Wagener  S.C.  and Cynthia of Framingham  Mass.; and a sister  Anne Eudey of Walnut Creek  Calif.A memorial service is scheduled for Nov. 14 at 2 p.m. in the Memorial Church  Harvard Yard. A reception will follow at Loeb House  17 Quincy St.  from 3 to 5 p.m.
Joseph J. Schildkraut,For a period during the late 1950s and 1960s  psychiatry attracted some of the most capable graduates of US medical schools. Intrigued by the conceptual interest of psychoanalytic theory  and the possibility of treatment via the couch  these students chose for residency departments of psychiatry that featured grounding in psychoanalysis. One of these was Joe Schildkraut  a 1955 summa cum laude graduate of Harvard College  where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year  and a 1959 cum laude graduate of Harvard Medical School. Having selected the Massachusetts Mental Health Center because of its reputation as a program offering a psychoanalytic approach  he found himself as a trainee intrigued by the dramatic response of depressed patients to the administration of electroconvulsive therapy  and imipramine and phenelzine  then being used clinically for the first time. Although Joe continued to be respectful of psychoanalytic treatments  that revelation altered his academic trajectory  and stoked a career that soon played a major role in launching research into the biological mechanisms of depression.Joe’s interest in the biological components of depression was given shape and substance by work with Milton Greenblatt who had set up a research unit at Mass Mental Health Center allied with a research laboratory at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. The laboratory could measure in urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)  the deaminated metabolite of norepinephrine. Joe observed that either Imipramine or phenelzine  two very different drugs  when given to depressed patients  led to an increase in VMA that was linked to clinical improvement. Having published this seminal finding  Joe went to the National Institute of Mental Health as a Clinical Associate and worked for four years with Seymour Kety  Irv Kopin  Jack Durrell  and Saul Schanberg. The result of this work was a paper  “The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders: A Review of Supporting Evidence” (1965). This paper  eventually the most frequently cited paper published in the American Journal of Psychiatry  launched 25 years of global research on the relationship between neurotransmitter function and affective disorders. Later versions of this hypothesis were published in Science with Seymour Kety as a co-author  and in the New England Journal of Medicine.Returning to Mass Mental Health Center in 1967  Joe set up the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory  which became the locus of his scientific work for the rest of his life. There he elaborated the concept presented in his seminal review article by defining subtypes of depression that could be identified by their biochemical “signature” based on measurement of norepinephrine metabolites in the urine. In retrospect  this work was a pioneering precursor of current research that seeks to replace diagnoses based on clinical signs and symptoms with a classification scheme grounded in biological markers that are much closer to actual disease processes. It also anticipated current efforts toward personalized medicine  to identify treatments that are tailored to attack disease subtypes defined by biological markers  including  now  allelic variants of DNA.Another groundbreaking implication of Joe’s work placed psychiatric disorders squarely in the realm of other medical conditions. For the first time it was possible to understand why depression is a frequent concomitant of disorders affecting metabolic processes in the liver. Rather than being viewed primarily as a psychological reaction to illness and disability  the depression associated with such disorders as infectious mononucleosis and hepatitis that affect liver function could now be understood as the result of disturbed norepinephrine metabolism. There was thus solid evidence that mental disorders were not simply manifestations of a set of psychological factors  but rather a clinical reaction to disturbed physical processes that could be understood by the same tools and the same conceptual framework as other illnesses.Through the Neuropyschopharmacology Laboratory Joe became not only a productive researcher  but a dedicated mentor as well. A series of young investigators launched their careers with him. They included Daniel Weinberger  Carl Salzman  Jon Gudeman  Geraldine Cassens  Paul Orsulak  Carl Schwartz  John Mooney  Jacqueline Samson-Jain  Alan Schatzberg  and Alan Green. As his career ripened  he became an indispensable guru to the entire Mass Mental Health Center faculty. His loyalty to the institution was deeply felt by him and  in consequence  by all of the staff. When times were difficult  as they had always been at that unusual place  Joe’s steadfast loyalty  and his helpful attitude assisted both trainees and staff to see a broader perspective in the value of public psychiatry at Harvard. In his later years  particularly  sequestered in his shadowy office  reclining on a Lazy Boy for his bad back  Joe was a steady presence  the “go-to” person for everyone. His commitment and his generosity with time and concern were legendary bedrocks of stability in an often-turbulent environment.Although Mass Mental Health Center had been a staunch participant in psychiatric research since its founding in 1912  its core mission was the care of patients with profound mental disorders. That tenacious clinical imperative deeply affected Joe’s research interests and the arc of his career. Before the term “translational research” had come into widespread use  Joe had oriented the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory in a clinical direction. Seeking to bring research findings to the bedside  Joe developed  in the 1970s and 1980s  a relationship with the New England Deaconess Hospital to offer clinicians laboratory studies of patients to refine treatment decisions in terms of subtypes of depression.His scientific work  recorded in 245 publications  led to numerous honors including the first Anna Monika Foundation Prize  the McCurdy-Rinkel Prize for Research from the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society  the Hofheimer Prize for Research from the American Psychiatric Association  the William C. Menninger Award from the American College of Physicians  the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry  and the Award for Research in Mood Disorders from The American College of Psychiatrists. He was also a Fellow of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology  the pre-eminent research organization advancing the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders. He was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Psychiatric Research from 1982-1992 and served on the editorial boards of numerous psychiatric and medical journals.Like many creative people  Joe’s talents were multi-faceted. Although personally precise  measured  and somewhat formal in demeanor  his avocation involved a lively interest in modern art  and particularly the works of the Catalan artist  Joan Miró. Not content to be simply an observer  Joe brought his clinical acumen and his intensity to understanding the source and the trajectory of Miró’s creativity. His view was that the work was the product of a depressive nature and represented a creative outcome of Miró’s emotional state. For Joe  the fanciful shapes in Miró’s pictures represented a “direct and lonely confrontation with the ultimate existential questions  whether to live or to die.” Thus depression for him was “one of the things that humans happen to be capable of experiencing ” rather than only a disorder. This view of one source of the creativity of a great artist disturbed critics as well as Miró’s relatives  and generated conflict that was eventually resolved by the acknowledgment of Miró’s grandson that his grandfather had indeed suffered from depression. Joe’s work on art resulted in a number of publications in scholarly journals on Miró  Rembrandt  and the Abstract Expressionists of the New York School. It led to his co-organizing with Aurora Otero in 1993 a symposium at the Miró Foundation in Barcelona  titled “Depression and the Spiritual in Modern Art: Homage to Miró ” which was later published in a book by the same name.In 1965 in Washington while he was working at NIMH he met Betsy Beilenson. With uncharacteristic speed he decided on the first date that he must marry her; after another date or two  she agreed. Their two sons  Peter and Mike  along with Betsy made a family that for nearly 40 years occupied first place in his concerns  despite his commitment to science and long hours of work.Joe died on June 26  2006 after a year-long painful struggle with esophageal cancer. At a memorial service three months later at Memorial Church in Harvard Yard  yet another  largely unknown aspect of his passions was revealed when the Harvard Band played a medley of Harvard football songs as his family and devoted friends walked to the Harvard Faculty Club for a reception celebrating his exemplary life and a career in science that helped to change the world.Respectfully Submitted Miles F.

He was 63.Poet  teacher  fiction writer  and editor  Gewertz won an O. Henry Award in 1982. He gave 22 years of service to the University. As a reporter for the Harvard University Gazette  he covered almost every aspect of life at the University  concentrating on the arts and humanities.
Teacher of Arabic Wilson B. Bishai dies at 85,Wilson B. Bishai  professor emeritus of Arabic for the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (NELC)  died Aug. 1 from kidney failure at his home in Maryland. He was 85.Born in Egypt  Bishai emigrated to the United States in 1951. He attended Maryland’s Washington Missionary College and Adventist Seminary  then earning his Ph.D. in Oriental studies in 1959 at Johns Hopkins University.He taught at the National Security Agency and the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies before moving to Boston. In 1966  Bishai came to Harvard  beginning his near 30-year career as a senior lecturer of Arabic.Extremely well liked by his students  Bishai was a pioneer in the development of the Bishai Computer Dictionary of Literary Arabic  an educational software specializing in teaching and translating the Arabic language.Former colleague William Graham  dean of the Harvard Divinity School (HDS)  said  “Wilson Bishai introduced a generation of Harvard students to modern Arabic language study. His good humor and infectious enthusiasm for Arabic were irrepressible  and all who studied with him remember him with fondness as well as appreciation.”He leaves his wife  Elizabeth; two sons  William and David  both of Baltimore  and a daughter  Linda of Washington  D.C. — all graduates of Harvard; brother Yousef of Grosse Point Farms  Mich.; and six grandchildren.Services have been held.
Gazette writer Gewertz dies at 63,Ken Gewertz  teacher  editor  and longtime staff writer for the Harvard University Gazette  died of cancer on Sept. 7 at his home in Watertown  Mass. He was 63. Gewertz gave 22 years of service to the University. As a reporter for the Gazette  he covered almost every aspect of life at Harvard  concentrating on the arts and the humanities. Graceful prose and quiet erudition distinguished his work. Gentleness and kindness distinguished his life.Said Thomas Lee at Harvard’s Office for the Arts  “Ken Gewertz was a gently inquisitive man whose modesty and quiet demeanor belied his wealth of knowledge  his breadth of appreciation for the arts and other subjects  and his elegant way with prose. No matter the subject  he always approached his writing assignments with a deep sense of Harvard’s mission to connect us to each other through the power of knowledge and creative thinking. Ken’s legacy will be the 20-plus years of chronicling many of those extraordinary connections  and acknowledging the people who made them possible.”Kenneth Lee Gewertz was born Feb. 11  1945  in the Bronx  New York  and spent most of his childhood in Floral Park  Queens. His father was an industrial chemist  his mother a homemaker. From a young age  Gewertz knew he wanted to be a writer: He read voraciously and as early as high school  he was sending off stories and poems to journals. Some of his early — and later — poems described fishing trips with a beloved grandfather as well as teenaged forays to places like Coney Island and Rockaway Beach.Gewertz graduated from Queens College in 1966  majoring in English. From there  he studied English in a Ph.D. program at Princeton University. His daughter Alexis was born in 1969. He left Princeton “ABD” in 1970. His first teaching job was at the University of Hawaii  where he stayed for a couple of semesters.The following year  Gewertz returned to New York City where he worked for several academic publishers as an editor and ghostwriter.Gewertz then moved to western Massachusetts where he wrote textbooks at Western New England College  and at Merriam-Webster Dictionary in the Connecticut River Valley. It was at Merriam-Webster that he met Sheila Murray; they married in 1983.During this period  Gewertz continued to write fiction and poetry  publishing his work in the Paris Review  Ploughshares  the Carleton Miscellany  and other journals  magazines  and newspapers.In 1982  Gewertz received the prestigious O. Henry Award for the short story “I Thought of Chatterton  The Marvelous Boy ” which had been published the year before in the Massachusetts Review.After a two-year stint as editor of Washington University in St. Louis Magazine from 1983 to 1985  Gewertz and his family came back East for good  where he worked briefly as an editor at Northeastern University before joining the staff of the Harvard University Gazette in 1986.At the Gazette  Gewertz turned his deep learning and practiced prose to touting the accomplishments of the Harvard academic community  producing profiles and news stories on philosophers  artists  musicians  scientists  economists  historians  and more. His work was succinct yet comprehensive; his understanding was profound but his writing was always accessible and engaging. Tall  gentle  wryly witty  Gewertz possessed an-almost-Old World elegance that coexisted comfortably with an egalitarian sensibility that friends  colleagues  and strangers alike were drawn to.William Cromie  former science writer for the Gazette and longtime colleague of Gewertz  recalled  “I was never so choked with a deadline that I wasn’t glad to see Ken. And he seemed to feel the same way when I’d walk unannounced into his book-cluttered office. We let our intellects run around together. Our talks were never very personal or at all spiritual  but they contained elements of both. They blew fresh air into my brain. It was always easier to find better ‘ledes’ and sentences after a visit with Ken.”Terry Murphy  managing editor of the Gazette  said  “As a journalist  Ken had the unique ability to approach a complex  deeply intellectual topic and produce a story that could seamlessly engage Harvard academia while entertaining and educating a wider audience. It must be said ” she added  “that deadlines were never Ken’s friend (and patience was never my virtue). Just before my final threat  a story would appear that often left me praising him. ‘Worth the wait ’ I’d hear myself saying.”A music (particularly jazz) lover  enthusiastic walker of his two standard poodles  and frequent traveler  Gewertz was also a loving husband and father. In 1997  he suffered a grievous loss when his daughter Alexis was killed in a traffic accident.In the final difficult years of his life  Gewertz remained a considerate and dedicated colleague  stoical in his suffering and devoted to his friends and co-workers  and to his beloved wife Sheila.Gewertz is survived by his wife and his brother  Daniel Gewertz.A memorial service will be held at the Memorial Church at Harvard University on Oct. 24 at 3 p.m.
Richmond memorial program scheduled for Oct. 27,A memorial service honoring the life of Julius B. Richmond will be held Oct. 27 at 10 a.m. at the Harvard Club of Boston  347 Commonwealth Ave. A reception will follow. A former U.S. surgeon general  Richmond held appointments at the Harvard School of Public Health  Harvard Medical School  and the Harvard Kennedy School. He died on July 27.
Dental School’s Goldhaber dies at 84,Paul W. Goldhaber  dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) for 22 years  died this past July 14 from complications of pancreatic cancer. He was 84. While dean  from 1968 to 1990  Goldhaber chartered a new course for dental education  overseeing major changes in the School’s dental curriculum and playing a major role in creating what he called “the era of enlightenment” in teaching and clinical practice. HSDM Dean Bruce Donoff said of Goldhaber  “He was truly a giant in the field of dental education and research. He firmly believed that science and discovery and research should be part of dental practice and dental education.”The eldest of three sons born to Polish immigrants  Goldhaber grew up in New York City speaking Yiddish as his first language. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School in New York City. After joining the Army  he was chosen for its Specialized Training Program  which funneled academically gifted enlistees into colleges during wartime. He graduated from the New York University (NYU) College of Dentistry in 1948. While in the service  he met Ethel Renee Gurland  and the couple married in 1949.Leaving the Army after active duty during the Korean War as a first lieutenant in the Dental Corps  Goldhaber completed his periodontology specialty training at Columbia University. He then ventured north to Boston and HSDM. He became an HSDM research assistant in 1954  as assistant professor of oral pathology in 1959  and professor of periodontology in 1962. In 1968  Harvard President Nathan Pusey appointed Goldhaber dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.Goldhaber said recently in a University of California  Los Angeles  commencement address  “I was the first Jew in Harvard University’s 332 years of existence to become a dean of one of its Schools.” In fact  many of his actions were well ahead of their time. As dean  he diversified the student body both ethnically and racially. He encouraged public service  research  and advanced education  making a significant contribution to the preparation of leaders in the profession. He added a compulsory fifth year of study at the Dental School  during which time students could choose to do research or obtain an advanced degree. He also expanded the School’s subspecialty degree programs and established with Harvard Medical School (HMS) a combined D.M.D./M.D. program in oral surgery.“I had the good fortune ” said Donoff  “to chair the Festschrift when Paul stepped down.” The event honored Goldhaber for all his accomplishments  highlighting two specific areas. “The first ” Donoff said  “was his belief in the importance of research in dental education. The second was his belief in a liberalized  more flexible dental curriculum to produce lifelong learners. Dr. Goldhaber’s own research laid the foundation for advances in bone biology and dental implants  which ushered in a new era of dentistry  enabling tooth implantation to become a routine dental procedure.”Charles N. Bertolami D.M.Sc. ’78  dean of the NYU College of Dentistry  noted that a great number of leaders in dentistry and dental education throughout the United States view Goldhaber as their personal mentor and model. Said Bertolami  “Dr. Goldhaber elevated the stature of dentistry within the university as both a learned profession and a caring profession.”Retiring as deanemeritusin 1990  Goldhaber continued to teach for many years. He regularly attended dinners and events at the School. In addition to his other national leadership positions and numerous publications  Goldhaber served as chair of the dental study section of the National Institutes of Health and was president of the American Association of Dental Research and of the International Association of Dental Research. He was a member of the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine.Goldhaber is survived by his wife Ethel Renee (Gurland) Goldhaber; two brothers  Stanley of Port Washington  N.Y.  and Norman of Boynton Beach  Fla.; sons Samuel and Joshua; and four grandchildren. Remembrances may be made to the Dr. Paul Goldhaber Fund at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
Anne Alonso,At the time of her death in August of 2007  Anne Alonso was widely held to be a leading teacher and practitioner of psychodynamic therapy of her day.Anne had the gift of narrative and a talent for rhetoric  two threads that ran unbroken through the tapestry of her life. The story she told was the story of the unconscious and its impact on relationships. For many  even seasoned psychotherapists  the unconscious is theory or tool or construct. For Anne  it was daily reality. Her clinical genius was rooted in the fact that for her the other side of the mind was as real as conscious life. While this shadow world and its landmarks are theory to most people — flat and two dimensional — to Anne it was not a map  but the territory itself. She was “from here ” a guide through its mysteries.In the academy and in the hospital  Anne wove the story of psychoanalysis so convincingly that hundreds and hundreds of trainees and students and colleagues and patients routinely began their own quotidian stories of self-learning with “Anne says….” As clinician  supervisor  and advocate of psychoanalytic theory and practice she was unexcelled.As befits a thoroughly psychodynamic person  her roots inform who she became. The complexity and contradictions of human personality were embodied in Anne. She was an Arab woman with a Catholic education  but that was the least of it. She was rooted in paradox. Her first languages were Arabic and French. Her father  Ernest Abokalil  was a Lebanese immigrant who was a left-wing union organizer with a capitalist streak  proprietor of a restaurant near the mills of Manchester  New Hampshire (which informed Anne’s love of food and cooking). Her mother Helen Hashim died before Anne was a year old  so Anne was raised by her father  grandmother  and aunt. Her experience of the female role in Arab culture was given extra dimension by her schooling with an order of French nuns whom she always remembered affectionately for their joy and grace. This diversity of origins perhaps fed her uncanny capacity to bridge cultural differences and her later preeminence as a practitioner of group psychotherapy and scholar of social systems. And her devotion to feminism may have begun as she stood  hand-in-hand with her father  hearing his male friends commiserate with him  “It is too bad  our brother  that you had no sons.”Anne had a special interest in group therapy. She served as the President of both the Northeastern Society for Group Psychotherapy and the American Group Psychotherapy Association. Most of her published papers had to do with group therapy.Her Presidential address when assuming office at the American Group Psychotherapy Association was entitled “Group Therapy and the Village Well.” The importance of community was omnipresent for Anne  and the use of groups as therapeutic vehicles was a natural for her. Her teaching was also often done in groups — and almost always included food!Anne’s influence was felt far beyond the United States. At her memorial service a Chinese physician stood to address the large crowd. He spoke of how important it had been for the Chinese mental health community that Anne had come to teach them. And he spoke of how available she had remained  conducting regular consultations via email and conference calls — all without charge. This physician had come to say his goodbyes completely on his own and without notifying anyone. It was important to him.Anne’s work in Argentina  Mexico and many other countries dramatically enhanced the use of psychodynamic therapy and group therapy in those locales.Anne spent her entire professional career affiliated with the MGH  beginning with her internship in 1968. Her first experiences were in the Acute Psychiatric Service  where she demonstrated a love of working with very disturbed patients  a love not always shared by psychoanalytic practitioners. She was one of four founding members of the “General Psychiatry Practice” in 1975  the first faculty group practice that was the seed crystal for the growth of the MGH Psychiatry Service’s outpatient division. Anne also founded the Center for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy which attracted several dozen colleagues as faculty to offer advanced post-graduate training for therapists  most of whom had graduated from the Psychiatry residency at MGH. The center offered a curriculum of seminars and supervision which became the intellectual center for the study of psychodynamic therapies at MGH. Through the Endowment for Psychodynamic Psychotherapy  which she founded and to which she was a major contributor  she supported not only the Center but contributed support to one of the few active psychodynamic psychotherapy research programs in the country at MGH. The endowment attracted celebrities and donors to support its work and rallied to the Endowment’s motto “So there will always be someone to talk to.”She cared for patients  taught seminars to psychiatric residents and psychology interns  and was a beloved and iconic teacher of the discipline of psychotherapy. A winner of teaching awards  she pioneered in the study and teaching of the art and discipline of psychotherapy supervision as well. She was the most sought after supervisor among a large faculty. Her advice and wisdom were often captured with sensitivity and humor in sayings such as: “the helping hand strikes again ” “don’t just do something sit there ” and “no good turn goes unpunished.” Therapists in training were prepared and strengthened for their work by introjecting Anne’s calm presence and patient insight. That she was so comfortable with listening to the greatest anguish allowed patients to find a way to bear their pain more readily themselves.MGH was  indeed  Alma Mater to Anne – the mother she lost and then regained.Respectfully submitted Jerrold Rosenbaum  chairJohn HermanJames GrovesScott RutanMartin Keller

Thomas Weller  Nobel laureate  HSPH professor emeritus  dies at 93,Thomas H. Weller  a Nobel Prize winner in 1954 and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) professoremeritus  passed away on Aug. 23. He was 93.Weller received the Nobel Prize for medicine with John Enders and Frederick Robbins for discovering how to grow poliomyelitis viruses in culture. This breakthrough laid the foundation for others to develop the polio vaccine and later other vaccines. The discovery demonstrated that scientists could grow viruses in human tissues in test tubes  foregoing the need for laboratory animals  and speeding the way toward other vaccines.Weller later was involved in isolating and growing varicella-zoster  the cause of chicken pox and shingles  and cytomegalovirus  a member of the herpesvirus family that can cause birth defects. Additionally  he and others isolated the rubella virus  which causes German measles. Weller maintained a lifelong interest in parasitology as well as virology and was keenly interested in the control of schistosomiasis.“Beyond his pioneering scientific breakthroughs in growing polio in culture and discovering varicella and rubella viruses  all of which made the new vaccines possible  Professor Weller became a champion for public health and the effort to focus the best of science on the diseases and health problems of the poorest people on the globe ” said Barry R. Bloom  dean of HSPH. “His impact has been incalculable  and his legacy will be something cherished by generations to come at HSPH and far beyond.”Weller earned a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1936. A year later  he received a master of science degree. He came to Harvard Medical School (HMS) in the 1930s  where he undertook studies in what was then the Department of Comparative Pathology and Tropical Medicine. His interests broadened to include general infectious diseases and viruses. Weller graduated from Harvard Medical School (HMS) in 1940 and received clinical training at Children’s Hospital Boston. Two years later  he began serving at a laboratory in Puerto Rico with the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army  where he worked on malaria control.After the war  Weller returned to Children’s Hospital and HMS. The Department of Comparative Pathology and Tropical Medicine was renamed the Department of Tropical Public Health and was transferred from HMS to HSPH. In 1954  Weller was named the Richard Pearson Strong Professor of Tropical Public Health and became head of the department  a position he held until 1981. (In 1997  the Department of Tropical Public Health merged with the departments of Cancer Biology and Molecular and Cellular Toxicology to form Immunology and Infectious Diseases and Cancer Cell Biology.) Weller achievedemeritusstatus in 1985.“Thomas Weller was one of the great scientists of the 20th century and a leader in neglected tropical diseases ” said Dyann Wirth  chair of the HSPH Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases and Richard Pearson Strong Professor of Infectious Diseases. “He inspired many during his lifetime  and his vision led an entire field for many decades. His legacy is one to be remembered.”In addition to his Nobel Prize  Weller received the E. Mead Johnson Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics  the Bristol Award of the Infectious Diseases Society of America  the George Ledlie Prize of Harvard University  and the VZV Research Foundation Scientific Achievement Award. He directed the Commission on Parasitic Diseases of the American Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. In 1964  he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences. He has held positions with the U.S. Public Health Service  World Health Organization  and U.S. Agency for International Development. In 1996  he received the Walter Reed Medal from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. He wrote an autobiography in 2004 titled “Growing Pathogens in Tissue Cultures: Fifty Years in Academic Tropical Medicine  Pediatrics  and Virology.”His family plans a private service. In lieu of flowers  memorial donations may be made to the Needham Public Library  1139 Highland Ave.  Needham  MA 02494. HSPH will honor Weller’s life and achievements with a memorial service during the upcoming academic year.

Scholar  curator  connoisseur Welch dies at 80,Stuart Cary Welch Jr.  curatoremeritusof Islamic and later Indian art at the Harvard Art Museum and former special consultant in charge  Department of Islamic Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art  died Aug. 13 while traveling in Hokkaido  Japan. He was 80 and a resident of New Hampshire.Welch  a legendary scholar  collector  and connoisseur  studied and taught at Harvard  where he was instrumental in transforming the Department of Islamic Art  establishing a curriculum of study of the arts of the Middle East and South Asia  and developing one of the finest collections of Islamic and later Indian art in this country. His lifelong association with Harvard culminated in his role over the past two decades as one of the most generous donors to the Harvard Art Museum.“The contributions made by Stuart Cary Welch to Harvard are immeasurable and reflect a life dedicated to the appreciation  study  and sharing of the works of art that he loved ” said Thomas W. Lentz  Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museum  who studied with Welch at Harvard. “Because of his endless curiosity and ongoing generosity  an exceptional resource for the teaching  research  and study of the artistic traditions of the Middle East and India exists for future generations. We mourn the loss of a brilliant scholar  teacher  curator  mentor  and friend.”“Cary was enormously energetic and prolific. He was simply a towering figure in the fields of Islamic and Indian art ” said Mary A. McWilliams  Norma Jean Calderwood Curator of Islamic and Later Indian Art at the Harvard Art Museum. “He had an extraordinary capacity to engage with a work of art and an exceptional ability to communicate his experience and insights to others. We are eternally grateful for his long service and stewardship of the Department of Islamic and Later Indian Art here at Harvard  as well as his myriad contributions to the study of those traditions.”Welch developed an appreciation of art early in his childhood. Aside from being a collector of drawings at a very young age  Welch himself was an accomplished draftsman  a skill that carried through to his enrollment at Harvard and beyond. He was a graduate of the St. Paul’s School in Concord  N.H.  in 1946. That same year he began his undergraduate studies in fine arts at Harvard  where he continued his graduate work in classical art from 1952 to 1954. During that time  Welch intensified his study and collecting of Islamic and Indian art. He also published some of his more entertaining and lighthearted drawings in Harvard’s literary and humor magazines  including his series of Popular Professions Illustrated that appeared in the Harvard Lampoon and the Harvard Advocate.While Welch concentrated in the study of fine arts at Harvard  at the time there were no classes or formal instruction available on the subject of Islamic or Indian art. Welch took the initiative to devise his own course of study by traveling extensively throughout the Middle East and South Asia to absorb regional traditions and culture. At the same time  Eric Schroeder  then honorary keeper of Islamic Art at the Fogg Museum  became his mentor at Harvard.In 1956  Schroeder invited Welch to become honorary assistant keeper of Islamic Art at the Fogg  and thus began an era that saw Welch use his infinite enthusiasm to transform the fledgling Department of Islamic Art. He spearheaded the effort to establish one of the first American university curriculums in the study of the arts of the Islamic world. In 1960  he taught the first class at Harvard in Near Eastern Art. An instructor for 25 years at Harvard  Welch arranged for works of art to be made available for study by students and scholars. Over four decades at Harvard  Welch served as honorary keeper  curator (retiring in 1995)  and finally curator emeritus  and during his tenure he vastly enriched Harvard’s holdings of Islamic and Indian art.Concurrent with his work at Harvard  Welch served as special consultant in charge  Department of Islamic Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 1987. He was instrumental in making many important acquisitions that greatly enhanced the Metropolitan Museum’s collection  and in 1985  he organized the groundbreaking exhibition “India: Art and Culture  1300–1900.”Welch’s scholarship  particularly in the fields of Persian and Indian painting and drawing  served as the foundation for many important exhibitions and accompanying publications  including “The Art of Mughal India  Paintings and Precious Objects” (Asia Society  1964)  the first important American exhibition devoted to Mughal art; “Wonders of the Age” (British Museum  National Gallery of Art  Harvard Art Museum  1979–80); “Gods  Kings  and Tigers: The Art of Kotah” (Asia Society  Harvard Art Museum  Rietberg Museum  1997–98); and “From Mind  Heart  and Hand: Persian  Turkish  and Indian Drawings from the Stuart Cary Welch Collection” (The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco  Harvard Art Museum  2004–05)  an exhibition of drawings from Welch’s landmark gift to Harvard in 1999 of more than 300 works.Over the 40 years that Welch spent at Harvard  he produced countless exhibitions  many of which may have been small in size  but which always tended toward the visual and poetic. His last exhibition is the first in a series titled “Perspectives” that is part of the long-term exhibition “Re-View” at the Harvard Art Museum/Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The small installation  “Tree of Life: Five Indian Variations on a Theme ” includes just five works of art but is characteristic of Welch’s vision and approach. It opened in April 2008 just a few days after Welch’s 80th birthday.Considered his greatest scholarly achievement was the immense  two-volume study of “The Houghton Shahnameh ” co-authored with Martin B. Dickson of Princeton University  which focused on the great early Safavid dynasty copy of the Persian national epic executed for the Safavid ruler and patron of the arts Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–1576). Welch’s insights fundamentally changed the way scholars thought about the development of early Safavid painting  demonstrating that it was  in fact  a brilliant synthesis of the earlier Timurid and Turkman styles of painting.Welch’s numerous exhibitions  publications  public lectures  and years of teaching propelled the study and appreciation of Islamic and Indian art to new heights  educating and enlightening generations of students  scholars  and museum visitors.Stuart Cary Welch Jr. is survived by his wife of 54 years  Edith Welch  four children  and four grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  contributions can be made to the Harvard Art Museum  Attn: Department of Institutional Advancement  32 Quincy St.  Cambridge  MA 02138; or St. Paul’s School  325 Pleasant St.  Concord  NH 03301.A memorial service is being planned at Harvard. Details about the location and date are not yet confirmed.
Edward ‘Ted’ W. Webster,Edward (“Ted”) W. Webster  Ph.D.  83  Professor Emeritus of Radiology (Physics) Harvard Medical School (HMS)  passed away on Saturday  December 17th  2005. He will be remembered both for his many scientific contributions and his friendly  warm and supportive manner. Dr. Webster retired in 2001 after 47 years of service with the Departments of Radiology at HMS and Massachusetts General Hospital. He is survived by his wife of forty-four years  Dorothea and six children  John  Peter  Anne  Edward  Mark and Susan; a sister  Margaret Bates; and six grandchildren.Ted was born on April 12  1922 in London  England in very modest circumstances. His father  a post-office worker  encouraged him to pursue academic achievement that led eventually to his attending the University of London as a scholarship student. He received a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering with First Class Honors in 1943 and stayed on for graduate research receiving is Ph.D. in 1946. After working for several years in England he ventured to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for post-doctoral study in high voltage engineering. There he joined a collaborative program between MIT’s high voltage accelerator group and Lahey Clinic to develop high-voltage electron and photon radiation dosimetry methods. Thus began Ted’s long career in Medical Physics. After a brief return to England he came again to the United States to accept a position as Medical Physicist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Radiology in 1953. He was  at that time  the only physicist in the department  supporting both Radiation Oncology and Diagnostic Radiology clinical activities.His research interests at that time included the application of electron beams to radiation therapy; a field in which he made important early pioneering contributions. As time went on his interests expanded to include diagnostic radiology  and when Radiation Oncology at MGH became a separate department he stayed in radiology as the director of the Division of Radiological Sciences  a position he held until his retirement in 2001. Over the years his research evolved into diagnostic imaging and radiation dosimetry and eventually to both the scientific and societal aspects of radiation effects. Over his career he became a pioneer and world-renowned contributor in the latter field as evidenced by his more than one hundred thirty publications  numerous invited lectures  academic debates and other activities.Ted was also a pioneer in the field of radiology education and was instrumental in the development of the American Board of Radiology’s Radiological Physics curriculum and examination system. He achieved certification in that organization in 1957 and soon after became an examiner in Physics. He served the board for more than twenty-six years and during his tenure contributed significantly to the design of the examination process. He served as an examiner for fifteen hundred radiologists and physicists during that time. Ted also founded and directed the New England Roentgen Ray Society’s course in radiological physics which for more than twenty years was a primary vehicle for the training of Radiology Residents in the New England region.During his years at MGH he was appointed Radiation Safety Officer (1962-1980)  Chairman of the Radiation Safety and Radioactive Drug Research Committees and the Committee on Research (1964-2001). During his long career he instructed radiology residents at Harvard University  Harvard Medical School  Harvard School of Public Health  and Northeastern University.He also served the field through his extensive activities in professional societies and government throughout his long career. He was a founding member of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine  served on its first board of directors and as its fifth president in 1964. He served on multiple committees of the National Council on Radiation Protection form 1961 to 1993 and authored a number of reference works published by that organization. He served as a member of the USFDA Beir III Committee that defined many of the modern ideas concerning radiation effects and numerous other national and international committees on Radiology and radiation effects from 1961-1995. These include The International Atomic Energy Agency  The International Council on Radiation Effects and Measurement  The World Health Organization  The International Council on Radiation Protection and The Atomic Bomb Casualty Committee.Ted received many prestigious awards in acknowledgement of his contributions to the fields of Radiology and Radiological Physics. Some of the more notable of these include the Coolidge Award of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (1983)  the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology (1991) and the Lauriston S. Taylor Award of the National Council on Radiation Protection (1992).He began his career when Radiological Physics was a new and formative field and was a major force in its development and growth for almost fifty years. His contributions will continue to shape the field for many years to come.Respectfully submitted James Thrall  ChairJohn Correia  Co-ChairRon CallahanGordon BrownellBeth Haire
Harvard News Office writer Ken Gewertz dies at 63,Longtime writer for the Harvard News Office Ken Gewertz died on Sept. 7 at his home in Watertown  Mass. He was 63.Gewertz gave 22 years of service to the University. As a reporter for the Harvard University Gazette  he covered almost every aspect of life at Harvard  but he concentrated on the arts and humanities. Elegant prose and quiet erudition distinguished his work. Gentleness and kindness distinguished his life. A memorial service at Harvard is being planned.
Memorial set for Moses,A memorial service honoring Henry C. Moses  the former dean of freshmen  will take place Sept. 19 at 2:30 p.m. at the Memorial Church. A reception will follow. Moses held the Harvard post from 1977 to 1991. He passed away April 16 at the age of 66.
Julius B. Richmond  former U.S. surgeon general  91,Julius B. Richmond  a seminal figure in the history of American public health and pediatrics  and the first national director of the Head Start program  who held professorial positions at three Harvard Schools  died July 27 at his home in Chestnut Hill  Mass. He was 91.As U.S. surgeon general in the Carter administration  Richmond issued the momentous 1979 report “Smoking and Health.” As surgeon general he also set targets for the health of the American public with the “Healthy People” report.During his time at Harvard  Richmond held appointments at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH)  Harvard Medical School (HMS)  and the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS).HSPH’s highest honor is named for him — the Julius B. Richmond Award — and it recognizes individuals who  like Richmond  have promoted and achieved high standards for public health conditions in vulnerable populations. The award was established in 1997  and Donna Shalala  former secretary of Health and Human Services  was the first to receive it. Last year  New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was honored. Richmond was an active participant and speaker at the award ceremonies over the years.In 2006  a celebratory symposium was held to honor the 90th birthday  life  and work of Richmond  and to launch what was then the newly established  University-wide Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University.“It was an enormous privilege for me to work with Julie during my deanship ” said Barry R. Bloom  dean of HSPH. “Whether I was seeking his advice on issues of children’s health or tobacco control  honoring him at the annual Julius B. Richmond Award event  or running into him in the HSPH cafeteria  which he visited regularly  he was always fully engaged in pursuing his many passionate interests in health with incredible energy. His presence will be sorely missed  but he will continue to inspire us.”Allan M. Brandt  Kass Professor of the History of Medicine at HMS and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences  called Richmond’s “contributions to medicine and public health … nothing short of legendary.” Brandt said “[Richmond] was a tireless and committed advocate for children and their well-being  here in the U.S. and around the globe ” and added that “as a result of his remarkable work  as a pediatrician  as a public servant  and as a champion for children and their families  millions now lead better lives.”And Jim Yong Kim  chair of the HMS Department of Global Health and Social Medicine  noted that “through his many important roles in the academy and in government  Julius Richmond did as much to improve the health of American citizens as anyone in the last century. But by far the greatest beneficiaries of his life’s work were impoverished children and their parents in the United States and throughout the world. Those of us who had the privilege of being his students and colleagues will miss him most for his warmth  sage advice on matters large and small  and  most of all  his commitment to social justice that served as a moral compass for us all.”Richmond was trained in pediatrics and child development and worked to introduce psychosocial development into pediatric education  research  and services. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois in 1937 and his M.D. from the University of Illinois School of Medicine in 1939. He served in the Army Air Force as a flight surgeon from 1942 to 1946. He returned to the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Illinois  and served as director of the Institute of Juvenile Research in Chicago.In 1953  Richmond became chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse. He rose to the position of dean. During his tenure there  he completed collaborative work with Bettye Caldwell on the development of young children growing up in poverty  which led to his appointment in 1965 as the first director of the national Head Start program. He also served as assistant director for health affairs of the Office of Economic Opportunity.From 1977 to 1981  Richmond served as U.S. surgeon general and assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. As surgeon general he reinvigorated tobacco control efforts through the release of the 1979 Surgeon General’s report “Smoking and Health” that presented considerable scientific evidence of the multiple harms of smoking. That same year  Richmond issued the landmark report  “Healthy People: The Surgeon-General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.” This report established quantitative health goals for the nation for the next decade — a process later institutionalized by the government. A committed advocate  he also chaired the steering committee of the Forum on the Future of Families and Children of the National Academy of Sciences from 1987 to 1993.Richmond served in a number of prominent positions in the Harvard community. He was director of the Judge Baker Children’s Center from 1971 to 1977. He was the director of the Division of Health Policy Research and Education at Harvard University. He also served as professor of child psychiatry and human development at Harvard Medical School as well as chairman of psychiatry at Children’s Hospital Boston.Richmond received numerous awards  including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics  the Gustav O. Lienhard Award and the Walsh McDermott Medal of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences  the John Howland Award of the American Pediatric Society  the Sedgwick Medal from the American Public Health Association  and the Heinz Award for Public Policy.Richmond was predeceased by his wife Rhee and his son Dale. He is survived by his wife Jean Berger Richmond; two sons  Charles of Indianapolis and Barry of Bethesda  Md.; two stepsons  Steven Berger of West Lafayette  Ind.  and Michael Berger of Detroit; and four grandsons and five step-granddaughters.Richmond’s family held a private funeral.

Intellectual historian Fleming dies at 84,Donald Fleming  an intellectual historian who studied the impact of science on American thought and was a member of the Harvard faculty for more than 40 years  passed away at his Cambridge home on June 16. He was 84.Fleming  who was known for his vibrant and engaging presence in the classroom and on the Harvard campus  came to Harvard as professor of history in 1959  and was named the Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History in 1970. He was the chair of the Department of History from 1963 to 1967  and between 1973 and 1980  he was director of the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History.Fleming taught courses on American and European intellectual history  and the history of science in America. He retired in 1999 at the age of 76. His courses were widely popular among undergraduates due to the organized  entertaining  and enthusiastic style of his lectures.Born in Hagerstown  Md.  Fleming graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1943  and received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1947. Fleming was on the faculty of Brown University from 1947 to 1958  where he was chair of the history department  and he taught at Yale from 1958 to 1959.Fleming’s published works included “William H. Welch and the Rise of Modern Medicine” (Little  Brown and Co.  1954) and “John William Draper and the Religion of Science ” which was published in 1950 and received the Albert J. Beveridge Prize of the American Historical Association. He was a Guggenheim Fellow from 1955 to 1956  and he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Harvard benefactor Katherine Loker dies at 92,Katherine Bogdanovich Loker  a major Harvard benefactor and one of the nation’s most active and generous supporters of higher education  died June 26 in Oceanside  Calif. She had suffered a massive stroke earlier in the week.Loker  who would have been 93 in August  maintained a level of activity that outpaced many people half her age. She was particularly involved at Harvard; at her alma mater  the University of Southern California (USC); and at California State University (CSU)  Dominguez Hills. Close to Harvard Presidents Derek Bok  Neil L. Rudenstine  Lawrence H. Summers  and Drew Faust  and deans of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Jeremy Knowles and William Kirby  she was an unwavering participant in the University’s gatherings of alumni and friends.“Katherine was an exceptional person and a wonderfully loyal and generous friend to this university and to higher education. Whether it was in support of the library  athletics  or renovations of historic Memorial Hall  her philanthropy was always undertaken with the students uppermost in her mind. Her generosity will affect many generations to come ” said Faust.Loker did indeed demonstrate a special interest in the welfare of students. At Harvard in the early 1990s  she funded the creation of a new gathering space for undergraduates  the Katherine Bogdanovich Loker Commons  on the lower level of Memorial Hall. Later  she stepped forward with another major gift to help renovate the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library  and Widener’s main reading room is named for her. She also led the way in the rebuilding of the Memorial Hall tower and in supporting women’s athletics at Harvard. Her gifts to Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences totaled more than $27 million.Introduced to the Harvard community by her husband  Donald P. Loker  a member of the Class of 1925  she joined with him in endowing a professorship of English in 1983. The Lokers were consistent in their support of Harvard and USC  and Katherine carried on their philanthropy for many years after Donald’s death in 1989.At Harvard  Mrs. Loker served as a national chair of The University Campaign from 1997 to 1999  as a member of the Committee to Visit the College from 1986 to 1993  and was a member of the Overseers’ Committee on University Resources Executive Committee. The University honored her longtime service and commitment by awarding her the Harvard Alumni Association Medal in 1996; and  in 2000  Harvard bestowed on her an honorary doctorate of humane letters.The University of Southern California also benefited from the Lokers’ generosity. They established the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute there  provided resources to endow research activities  and endowed a professorship in organic chemistry. Another gift funded the Katherine B. Loker Track and Field Stadium at USC. Mrs. Loker had been an accomplished sprinter in her youth  and competed for a spot on the 1936 U.S. Olympic team  missing out by fractions of a second.In 1999  Mrs. Loker was awarded an honorary degree by California State University  Dominguez Hills. That institution recognized her for helping to shape its vision since its founding in the 1960s. Further  CSU  Dominguez Hills  celebrated the Lokers for making possible a new student union  and for Mrs. Loker’s leading the construction of a building to house a unique magnet school  the California Academy of Mathematics and Science. She served CSU  Dominguez Hills  as a member of the President’s Advisory Board and the University Foundation Board of Directors.A native of Southern California  Mrs. Loker supported numerous other area institutions  including the Donald P. Loker Cancer Treatment Center at California Hospital  the California Museum of Science and Industry  the California Medical Center of Los Angeles  and the Los Angeles Music Center. She was a board member of the Richard M. Nixon Memorial Library and Birthplace in Whittier  Calif. She had been a longtime friend of the Nixons and of President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. In 1993  Loker was saluted by the Senate Rules Committee of the California Legislature for her philanthropy and work on behalf of public and private organizations throughout the state. In 1999  The New York Times highlighted her as one of Southern California’s leading philanthropists.Mrs. Loker’s parents were immigrants from Croatia  who settled in San Pedro  Calif. Her father  Martin Bogdanovich  a fisherman  founded the French Sardine Co. in 1917  which later became StarKist Foods. Her husband was a movie and stage actor for 15 years  served in the U.S. Navy during World War II  and then joined the StarKist management team before retiring in 1975 and pursuing a career in private investment. Mrs. Loker is survived by her two daughters  Katherine Pinard of Mashpee  Mass.  and Deborah Hicks of San Francisco  and six grandchildren.
Herbert Bloch,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 6  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Herbert Bloch  Pope Professor of the Latin Language and Literature  Emeritus  died on September 6  2006  in Cambridge. Born in Berlin on August 18  1911  he was the elder son of Ludwig Bloch  director of the Dresdner Bank  and Alice Gutman  the bank owner’s daughter  both Jews. Bloch studied ancient history  classical philology  and archaeology at the University of Berlin  which he left for Rome in 1933. His brother Egon remained and died in the Holocaust.Bloch received his doctorate in 1935 and diploma in 1937 from the University of Rome  where he studied Roman history under Arnaldo Momigliano. Though director of Bloch’s thesis  Momigliano professed that he could teach his student nothing: Bloch knew everything already. His thesis on Roman brickstamps (used by brickmakers in some of the most important monuments of Rome such as the Pantheon  and exactly dated by the year of manufacture) was written in perfect Italian  and became the foundation of a new branch of Roman archaeology.In March 1938 Bloch’s aptitudes resulted in a memorable experience. Before Chancellor Hitler paid a state visit to Rome  Mussolini planned as the tour’s centerpiece a stop at the reconstructed Ara Pacis  an altar of peace completed in 9 BCE. The organizers  recognizing that their German translation of the catalog was a disaster  asked Bloch to step in. Bloch faced a choice between helping a country that had sheltered him or refusing out of distaste for one that had driven him out. He stayed up two nights running to produce a new version.The anti-Semitic laws of late 1938 forced Bloch to leave Italy  and in 1939 he emigrated to America. George Hanfmann  the art historian and archaeologist who had been a student with him in Berlin  helped secure him a Harvard connection. Bloch was to be among the first fellows at Dumbarton Oaks  then Harvard’s sole center in Washington  but when Carl Newell Jackson  Eliot Professor of Greek Literature  fell ill  John Finley  acting chair of the Department of the Classics  hired Bloch as a substitute.Paradoxically  the war years initiated unbroken stability in Bloch’s life. Naturalized in 1946  he remained deeply grateful to the United States for granting him haven. Equally strong was his resistance to intolerance or persecution. In 1954  he decided against a permanent position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  partly out of horror that the chairman of the board of trustees testified against J. Robert Oppenheimer. In contrast  Nathan Pusey  recently appointed president of Harvard  stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy. Fifteen years later  Bloch himself took a stand by speaking in a faculty meeting against the students who had occupied University Hall  whom he regarded as resembling Nazi youths.Bloch taught at Harvard from 1941 to 1982  as instructor  faculty instructor  assistant professor  associate professor  professor  and Pope Professor. His teaching and research involved Greek and Roman historiography  Latin epigraphy  Roman archaeology (particularly architecture)  medieval history  and medieval Latin literature. His courses advanced medieval studies especially  by inspiring students who themselves became eminent.Bloch was both a classicist and a medievalist. As a classicist he did pioneering work on Greek and Roman historians  and also on Latin epigraphy  the study of inscribed texts that form an essential source for ancient history. As a medievalist  he is known above all for investigations  begun in 1940  on the Benedictine Abbey of Montecassino. His crowning achievement was Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages. This massive work  combining evidence from historical texts with insights from artworks  was immediately recognized as a monument in itself. Although uniquely his own  it also bears witness to his second wife  Ellen  who drove him to many out-of-the-way sites and took many of the photographs. Well into his eighties  Bloch also published on Peter the Deacon  who became central in Bloch’s investigations into the rise of Montecassino.In the 1970s and 1980s Bloch sparked a controversy about Montecassino that was anything but medieval  when he criticized as unnecessary and even detrimental to victory the Allied bombing of the monastery in 1944. This study caused him to be denounced in the New Zealand parliament  but he had many defenders elsewhere. His devotion to Montecassino led to an honorary degree from the University of Cassino and endeared him to the monks there.Committed simultaneously and authoritatively to both ancient and medieval culture and not only to literature but also to history and art  Professor Bloch attained much recognition  as Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellow; member of the Institute for Advanced Study; syndic of Harvard University Press; senior fellow of the Society of Fellows; and trustee of the Loeb Classical Library. He was elected to academies and societies in the United States  Italy  Germany  and Finland. His institutional ties transcended the merely honorific. To cite two examples  Bloch served as president of both the American Philological Association and the Fellows of the Medieval Academy. He also spent terms as Professor-in-Charge and Resident in Classical Studies at the American Academy in Rome.This enumeration gives a glimpse of Bloch’s achievements and values  but fails to capture his physical presence. Tall and lean  he had an Old World courtliness and courtesy; a captivatingly resonant  deep voice; a modesty and kindliness; and a genuine interest in others that made him beloved. Beyond people was nature. During his half century or so in Belmont  he walked daily in conservation land.Herbert Bloch is survived by his twins  Anne Bloch  of Arlington  and Mary Alice (Nini) Bloch  of Bedford  Massachusetts. They are his daughters by his first wife  Clarissa (née Holland)  who died in August 1958. His second wife  Ellen (née Cohen)  died in May 1987.Respectfully submitted Virginia Brown (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies)Giles Constable (School of Historical Studies  Institute for Advanced Study)Christopher P.

David Roy Shackleton Bailey,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 20  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.David Roy Shackleton Bailey was born on December 10  1917  in Lancaster  England. He attended the Lancaster Royal Grammar School  where his father was headmaster  and in 1935 began his studies at Gonville and Caius College  Cambridge  where he read Part I of the Classics Tripos  getting a first  with distinctions in Greek and Latin verse. Unusually  he then did Oriental Languages (Sanskrit and Pali) Part I  again getting a first. When the war came  like other brilliant classicists and linguists  he was recruited for work in Intelligence  including a stint at Bletchley Park  Bedfordshire; he was mainly engaged in translating Dutch and Turkish messages.After the war  Shackleton Bailey returned to Cambridge  first as a fellow of his old college  where he later served as bursar  and then at Jesus College. From 1948 he was University Lecturer in Tibetan. His interest in that language and subject was said to have been in part motivated by an interest in the occult; rumors circulated that he taught the exiled Dalai Lama exotic forms of solitaire. In 1968 he moved to a Chair of Latin at the University of Michigan. He came to Harvard in 1976. From 1982 until his retirement in 1988  he was Pope Professor of the Latin Language and Literature. He returned to Ann Arbor  where he died on November 28  2005.In 1967  aged 50  Shackleton Bailey married Hilary Amis  following her divorce from the novelist Kingsley Amis. When she opened up a fish-and-chip shop in Ann Arbor called “Lucky Jim’s ” he would tend tables or work the cash register  resplendent in a white chef’s apron. He was generally unsuited to domestic life  however  and the union did not last. Martin Amis recollecting those years  captures the less positive aspects: “Shack . . . was  I always thought  the diametrical opposite of my father: a laconic  unsmiling  dumpty-shaped tightwad. I used to say to myself: Mum’s had enough of charm.” Shackleton Bailey is survived by his second wife  Kristine Zvirbulis  whom he married in 1994  after his retirement to Ann Arbor.“Shack ” as he was generally known and addressed  was a prodigious scholar  a towering figure in the textual criticism and editing of Latin literature  and a brilliant student of Roman Republican history and society. To say that his chief contribution was in the editing of a whole range of Latin texts only begins to describe the enduring importance of his work  which amounts to some 50 volumes and more than 200 articles and reviews. In the latter years of his retirement he produced a series of new translations of Valerius Maximus  Martial  Statius and other authors for the Loeb Classical Library  the comprehensive series of translations of Greek and Latin literature  published by Harvard University Press. His final  posthumous publications became volumes 500 and 501 of the Loeb Classical Library  thereby establishing him as its most prolific author.Alongside A. E. Housman  Shackleton Bailey is recognized as one of the greatest scholars of Latin textual criticism in the twentieth century. Such expertise comes only through a deep immersion in the literary  historical  and social traditions in which the Latin language evolved. Shack’s combination of daunting intelligence  precise learning  brilliant wit  and broad cultural sensibility are unlikely to be seen again. His own prose style is eminently quotable. These are the qualities that tied him to Housman  and  with him  to Richard Bentley in the eighteenth century. All three of them possessed the power of textual divinatio  as it has been called  the ability to emend or explain texts which  in the course of their transmission  have become corrupted or opaque.The name of Shackleton Bailey is most closely associated with that of Cicero (106–43 BC)  whose letters (in their entirety) and speeches (selectively) he edited  with translation and commentary  in ten large volumes. Scholars  students  and (through later Penguin and Loeb Classical Library translations) the general educated reader  were  and continue to be  indebted to him  particularly for his work on Cicero’s letters—our best evidence for the twilight years of the Roman republic. Cicero’s correspondence  very little of which was ever intended for the public eye  reveals much about the most important orator—and  in many ways  thinker—of the Roman world. As Achilles was fortunate to find his poet in Homer  so Cicero is lucky to have found his interpreter in Shackleton Bailey. The letters bristle with literary and other jokes; with oblique references to persons  sometimes unnamed  for whom we have no other evidence; with allusions to political happenings of central importance  again known primarily or only from the letter in question. Brilliant at representing the idiom of this complex Roman statesman  poet  orator  philosopher  and theorist of rhetoric  Shackleton Bailey revealed the depth of his scholarly control of all aspects of Latin and of late Republican Rome  and so gave the world a Cicero who never meant us to read his correspondence  but who is infinitely more complex  sympathetic and  ultimately  more human for our being able to do so.But Shack was also a colorful figure  a type unlikely to make it past the first search committee interview in the current orthodoxy. An eccentric figure by most standards—his regular attire was a grey suit and colorful sneakers long before the latter became part of the academic’s uniform—but mainly in the true and joyous sense of the word: quirky  difficult  cultured in profound and complex ways  endowed with a rare and keen sense of humor now cutting  now playful  a critic of human foibles and a man whose dedication to logic  reason  judgment  and the primacy of intelligence made those in his presence careful of their thoughts and words. Contrary to the popular assumptions and the evidence of his course evaluations  he was an effective and popular teacher to those few who were prepared to be taught  in the areas in which he had things to teach. In the classroom  as in his dealings in general  his scholarly magnitude led many to mistake an intense shyness for hostility  indifference or dismissal—attitudes that  admittedly  were not absent where he felt they were deserved. He was a great lover of cats; his greatest affection was for the first  the white cat Donum  to whom he dedicated the first volume of his edition of Cicero’s letters  “more intelligent than most people I have encountered ” as he once somewhat disconcertingly remarked. Anecdotes abound  and the work endures.Respectfully submitted Kathleen ColemanZeph Stewart †Richard TarrantRichard Thomas  Chair
HMS technical staff member Andrew J. Hession  52,Andrew J. Hession  an HVAC technician for Harvard Medical School (HMS) for seven years  died on May 26 of complications from heart surgery. He was 52. A widely known figure throughout the HMS campus  Hession was particularly appreciated for his expertise and mild manner in the face of HVAC emergencies. He is survived by his wife Mary V. (Murphy) Hession.
Arnold Herbert Colodny,Dr. Colodny was born in Burlington  Vermont. He received the B.S. degree magna cum laude from the University of Vermont in 1948  where he was first in his class  and in 1952 the M.D. degree cum laude  from the University of Vermont College of Medicine. He did a surgical internship at the University of Minnesota  and then returned to Boston to complete a surgical residency at the Boston City Hospital from 1954 to 1959. In 1959 he was accepted to be a senior resident in surgery in Dr. Robert Gross’ department at Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Boston. During this residency he met and married Lillian Hill. In 1961  after he had completed training in pediatric surgery  Dr. Colodny was accorded the unique honor of being invited by Dr. Robert Gross to join the surgical staff at Children’s Hospital. Dr. Gross rarely asked his graduating surgical residents to stay on the surgical staff  believing instead  that they should take positions at other children’s hospitals to strengthen the field of pediatric surgery. However  Gross recognized that Colodny was an exceptionally fine surgeon  and in his quiet and meticulous manner  much like Dr. Gross himself.Anomalies of the genito-urinary tract are among the most common of all congenital anomalies. Babies with these anomalies frequently require urgent surgery soon after birth  and in many cases  additional operations during childhood. Until the late 1960s these surgical procedures were performed mainly by pediatric surgeons and occasionally by urologists whose main interest was adults. However  in the late 1960s  Dr. Alan Perlmutter moved from the world of adult urology at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital to concentrate on pediatric urology at Children’s Hospital  where a genito-urinary clinic began to flourish. At the same time  Dr. Colodny saw the need for specialized care of these young patients by a pediatric surgeon  and worked closely with Perlmutter.When Dr. Perlmutter left Boston to become chief of urology at Detroit Children’s Hospital  Dr. Judah Folkman  Surgeon-in-Chief  appointed Arnold Colodny to be director of the genito-urinary clinic at Children’s  and in 1974 to be Acting Chief of the Division of Urology at the Hospital  a position he held for the next three years. During this period  he pioneered improvements in surgical techniques for removing bladder diverticula; reported a new method for construction of ileal loops as replacements for dysfunctional bladders; improved the management of children with neurogenic bladders; and with Dr. Thorne Griscom in the department of radiology at Children’s developed a radiological method of detecting neonatal urinary ascites resulting from obstruction of the urinary system or leakage from it.When Folkman recruited Dr. Alan Retik from the Floating Hospital to become chief of the division of urology  his assistant  Dr. Stuart Bauer  came with him. Arnold Colodny was named Associate Director of the Division of Urology. Together  they built the most outstanding pediatric urological center in the world  and it became a separate Department in the hospital. Its laboratories are outstanding  and very well funded by NIH grants. This is just one of Arnold Colodny’s legacies.He also became known as one of the most outstanding mentors among surgeons who care for children. When graduates of the surgical and urological residency programs at Children’s Hospital returned to Boston to give a lecture  or for a reunion  they would recall that when they were faced with a very sick child with a puzzling diagnosis  or a difficult situation in the operating room  they would ask themselves  “What would Dr. Colodny do?” He was the surgeon’s surgeon.He was admired and beloved by his patients and their parents. They knew him as a consummate and meticulous surgeon  but he was also their doctor who visited their bedside early in the morning and late at night  who often changed their dressings himself  and introduced them to his residents. To all of us who worked with him  he was a revered colleague.Arnold loved fishing and boating  and he and Lillian shared many a trip in his Boston whaler. Lillian always traveled with him to the various annual surgical meetings  and together they often entertained students  residents and colleagues in their home.In 1990  Dr. Colodny was honored by the University of Vermont as an outstanding alumnus with the Award for Distinguished Academic Achievement. In 1996  a visiting lectureship was established in his name at the University of Vermont.Dr. Arnold Colodny is survived by his wife Lillian  their sons Craig and Eric  and their daughter Lisa  and four grandchildren. His exemplary life and career have left a memorable legacy to his family  friends  and fellow surgeons.Respectfully submitted Judah Folkman
Wendell Vernon Clausen,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences April 8  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Wendell Vernon Clausen  Pope Professor of the Latin Language and Literature  and Professor of Comparative Literature  Emeritus  died on October 12  2006  in Belmont  Massachusetts. He was 83 years of age  and had been in declining health after suffering a stroke in August 2005.Wendell Clausen was born in Coquille  Oregon  on April 2  1923. He received his B.A. from the University of Washington in 1945  majoring in both Classics and English. In his senior year he was uncertain which field to pursue  and so he sought guidance from a professor of English whom he admired  Allen Rogers Benham. Benham’s advice was unambiguous: “Be a classicist! Anyone can teach English.” Wendell duly enrolled for graduate study in Classics at the University of Chicago  obtaining his Ph.D. in just three years. His first appointment was at Amherst College  where he taught from 1948 to 1959. At Harvard he was Professor of Greek and Latin from 1959 to 1982  then Victor S. Thomas Professor of Greek and Latin from 1982 to 1988 and Pope Professor from 1988 to 1993; he also held an appointment as Professor of Comparative Literature from 1984 to 1993. He served as chairman of the Department of the Classics from 1966 to 1971 and as Editor of Harvard Studies in Classical Philology in 1973–4  1982  and 1992–3.Wendell initially made his name as a distinguished editor of classical Latin poetry. His first major publication  in 1956  was an edition of the satirist Persius  a notoriously difficult writer. Wendell’s was the first satisfactory critical edition  and its combination of deep erudition and refined taste—traits that would mark all his scholarship—brought him to international attention. It was quickly followed in 1959 by an edition of Persius and his fellow-satirist Juvenal for the Oxford Classical Texts series  in which Wendell was the first American scholar to publish a volume. In another OCT volume  he joined with three eminent British Latinists to edit a group of poems attributed to Virgil and known collectively as the Appendix Vergiliana (1966).Alongside this editorial work  Wendell also produced a series of articles that attested to his interest in the poetry of the late Republic and the Augustan period—the poetry of Catullus and Horace  of Propertius and Ovid  and  above all  of Virgil. In later years literary-critical work came to occupy the center of his scholarly efforts  and it is arguably as an interpreter of Latin poetry that he made his most distinctive contribution to classical studies. He was one of the first English-speaking classicists to explore the relationship between Latin poets and Hellenistic Greek poetry  with which he had a rare familiarity  and his subtle analyses revealed a new dimension of artistry in poems that had been studied for centuries. Among the products of his research in this area are his contributions to the Cambridge History of Latin Literature (1982)  which he co-edited with E. J. Kenney; his Sather Lectures at the University of California at Berkeley  published in 1987 under the title Virgil’s Aeneid and the Tradition of Hellenistic Poetry and reissued in a revised and expanded form in 2002 under the title Virgil’s Aeneid: Decorum  Allusion  and Ideology; and his magisterial commentary on Virgil’s Eclogues  the distillation of decades of thought  published in 1994  the year following his retirement. His last published work  completed in collaboration with a former student  James E. G. Zetzel of Columbia University  was an edition of a ninth-century commentary on Persius  the so-called Commentum Cornuti; it appeared in 2004  bringing to fruition a project announced almost fifty years previously.One of Wendell’s great strengths as an interpreter was his ability to integrate the most exacting philological scholarship with a finely tuned literary sensibility. The two skills did not merely coexist  but were mutually reinforcing  the lungo studio informing and illuminating the grande amore. To speak of love in this context is no exaggeration  since for Wendell poetry was far more than the object of his professional study; it was a lifelong passion and a source of delight and sustenance. To hear him recite from one of his favorite Latin or English poets  with great feeling and often from memory  was a deeply moving experience. The qualities he admired in the poets he interpreted—learning  concision  exquisite craft—were also to be found in his own writing. He took to heart Callimachus’ dictum “a big book is a big nuisance ” and strove to convey much in a small compass. Two of his most influential articles run to only ten pages each.As a teacher  Wendell had a profound impact on two generations of Harvard Classics students  both undergraduate and graduate. Many of the graduate students he trained have gone on to distinguished careers as classicists. But his relationship with his students went beyond that of a typical teacher and mentor. He nurtured them with care and supported them staunchly  and they reciprocated with a deep and steadfast devotion. The words of one express the sentiments of many: “Wendell was to me everything I ever admired or ever hoped to be in my life as a classicist.”Only a few of the many awards and honors he received can be mentioned here. In 1952–3 he was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome  and in 1963 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (in a cohort that also included James Ackerman  Morton Bloomfield  and Noam Chomsky). In 1982 he held the Sather Lectureship at Berkeley  and in 1994 his contribution to Virgilian studies was recognized with the award of the Premio Internazionale Virgilio by the Accademia Nazionale Virgiliana di Mantova and the Provincia di Mantova. This last distinction gave him particular pleasure  since his affection for Italy was almost as great as his love of Virgil. In 1998  to commemorate his seventy-fifth birthday  he was presented with a volume of essays by friends and former students. Appropriately  this Festschrift is  by the gargantuan standards too often typical of the genre  a conspicuously lean volume  twenty papers making up a mere 300 pages.Wendell’s death on October 12  2006  was followed less than a month later by that of his beloved wife  Margaret  on November 6. Wendell Clausen is survived by his sister Ilene Hull; by three sons from his first marriage  John  Raymond  and Thomas; by a stepson  Edward Woodman; a stepdaughter  Jane Woodman; and by five grandchildren.In his first year at Harvard  Wendell and Steele Commager taught a half course in Catullus and Horace. A student taking the course was asked by a friend what Professor Clausen was teaching  and he replied: “Elegance.” Elegance was indeed at the heart of everything Wendell taught  and it is a lesson that his work continues to teach  to all those who care about the poetry of Rome.Respectfully submitted Dante Della TerzaDavid O.

Harvard economist and adviser to presidents Houthakker dies at 83,Harvard economist Hendrik Samuel Houthakker  83  a member of the Council of Economic Advisers for two presidents and holder of a papal knighthood  died on April 15 at Genesis Healthcare in Lebanon  N.H. After his retirement from Harvard in 1994  he divided his time between his Cambridge office and family homes in Pomfret  Vt.  and Hanover  N.H.  where he continued his studies in economics. There he enjoyed life with his wife  the philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka  his two sons  and his dogs.Born in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  in 1924  Houthakker was the son of Marion (Lichtenstein) and Bernard Houthakker. After completing graduate studies at the University of Amsterdam in 1949  he did economic research at Cambridge University. In 1952  he visited the United States and joined the staff of the Cowles Commission for Economic Research at the University of Chicago. From there  he taught at Stanford University from 1954 to 1960. He joined the Department of Economics at Harvard in 1960. At Harvard  he became the Henry Lee Professor of Economics.Both Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon chose Houthakker to serve on their presidential Council of Economic Advisers. He continued his interest in public service as a consultant to numerous government agencies  including the Commission on Supplies and Shortages.Probably his best-known work is “Revealed Preference and the Utility Function” (Economica  1950)  in which  through development of the strong axiom of revealed preference  he settled the last remaining question concerning the integrability of demand functions based on revealed preference. He also wrote two widely cited empirical books on consumption  “The Analysis of Family Budgets” (with S.J. Prais  1955) and “Consumer Demand in the United States  1929-1970” (with Lester D. Taylor  1966). In a brief but classic article (“The Pareto Distribution and the Cobb-Douglas Production Function in Activity Analysis ” Review of Economic Studies  1955) he showed how a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function could emerge from a Pareto-distributed collection of fixed-coefficient firms. He wrote frequently on international trade  including the well-known article with Stephen P. Magee  “Income and Price Elasticities in World Trade” (Review of Economics and Statistics  1969). His research also reflected continuing interest in commodity and energy markets.Houthakker was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences  and the American Economic Association  from which he received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1963. He was vice president of that organization in 1972 and became a distinguished fellow in 1989. He also served as president of the Econometric Society in 1967. The University of Amsterdam and the University of Fribourg awarded him honorary doctorates.Although known for his dedication to public affairs  scholarship  teaching  and humanitarian ideals primarily in the field of economics  he was also a longtime supporter of philosophy and the fine arts. For 40 years  he fostered understanding and friendship among cultures at the philosophical level through his generosity to the World Phenomenological Institute  founded by his wife. Although not a Catholic himself  he organized an economic symposium at the Vatican on the 100th anniversary of Rerum Novarum  the papal encyclical on the condition of the working classes. A friend of Karol Wojtyla  Houthakker invited the cardinal to speak at Harvard  introducing him to Harvard and America as “the next pope.”In 2003  his old friend  then Pope John Paul II  chose Houthakker to be a Knight Commander with Star in the Papal Order of Saint Gregory  acknowledging Houthakker’s particular service to the Catholic Church. He was inducted into the knighthood by the Most Rev. Walter J. Edyvean  auxiliary bishop and vicar general of Boston  at St. Denis Church in Hanover  N.H.Known by his friends and colleagues for his modesty and humility  combined with his elegant manner  Houthakker had a lifelong appreciation for art (he was the son of a renowned fine arts dealer in Amsterdam). In this country  he came to love the New England countryside  especially his farm in Pomfret  Vt. Years ago  he conserved 1 000 acres of property in Vermont.He is survived by his wife of 52 years  Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka; his children Louis Tymieniecka Houthakker  Jan-Nicolas Tymieniecka Houthakker  and Isabella Romana Houthakker; and his brother Lodewijk Houthakker of Amsterdam.A memorial service will be held in Cambridge  Mass.  in fall 2008.
Krister Stendahl  86  was HDS dean from 1968-1979,Krister Stendahl  who played a crucial role in shaping the life and work of Harvard Divinity School (HDS)  just as he was also a pioneer in the broader realm of ecumenical relations  died on April 15 at the age of 86.At the time of his death  Stendahl was Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity Emeritus and former dean of the Faculty of Divinity. But  while he had been affiliated with the University since 1954  Stendahl  through his biblical scholarship  teaching  interfaith work  and church and academic leadership  exerted the kind of profound influence on other people’s lives that transcends a single institution or country.Diana L. Eck  professor of comparative religion and Indian studies  called Stendahl “a giant in the Harvard family. He converted the world of [HDS] to a much wider  ecumenical world … and was one of the world’s most respected pastoral and theological voices. He was the person around the table who was so insightful in looking at the ways the gospels required a kind of theology of the neighbor.”Eck added that Stendahl “wrote and presented and advocated for women’s ministries in the churches.”In his native Sweden  for example  he was bishop of Stockholm from 1984 to 1988  leading a reform effort on issues such as women’s ordination  gay and lesbian rights  and the relationship of church and state. In the early 1990s  he was the first Myra and Robert Kraft and Jacob Hiatt Distinguished Professor of Christian Studies at Brandeis University  where he helped inaugurate a program designed to enhance shared values among students of many religious backgrounds.After his retirement from the Brandeis position in 1993  he and his wife  Brita  a writer and scholar  spent much time traveling as unofficial diplomats in the interests of Christian-Jewish relations. Perhaps most notably in this regard  Stendahl became co-director of the Osher Center for Tolerance and Pluralism at the Shalom-Hartman Institute in Jerusalem in 1994  and did much to facilitate American scholars’ working visits to the Holy Land.HDS Dean William A. Graham said Stendahl broke from the restraints of past scholarship by bringing more women into religious studies and by building bridges between scholars of different faiths.“He was tremendously open to the study of religions outside the Christian tradition ” said Graham.Stendahl was also “an absolutely brilliant lecturer ” said Graham  who vividly remembered a graduate course in the Old Testament he took from the senior scholar in 1966.Born in Stockholm and educated at Uppsala University  Stendahl was ordained in the Church of Sweden (Lutheran) in 1944. He served as a parish priest and as chaplain at Uppsala before receiving a doctorate there in 1954. That same year  he came to Harvard as a professor of New Testament studies  recruited as part of President Nathan Pusey’s initiative to rebuild a Divinity School that had virtually faded from view before Pusey arrived. Fourteen years later  Stendahl became dean of a Harvard Divinity School that could claim a world-class faculty.During his tenure as dean  from 1968 to 1979  Stendahl presided over the continuing transformation of the School  whose student body  faculty  and curriculum grew and became much more diverse  especially in regard to women and African Americans and to studies in religion specifically linked to those groups. Throughout this time — one of the most tumultuous political eras of American history — Stendahl successfully guided HDS with an astute  sometimes blunt decisiveness that was tempered by his wry humor and his enormous gift for listening  which were part of a complete  and consistent  pastorly presence.Over the course of his long academic career  Stendahl’s scholarly work and his writing addressed many different topics in theology  history  and the arts of ministry and many contemporary issues of church and society. There was  however  a constant thread of pondering  and trying to redefine  relations between Jew and Christian as well as the roles that women play in religious life. Asked once why Jews and women became such a focus for his scholarly work  especially in such books as “The School of St. Matthew” (1954)  “The Bible and the Role of Women” (1966)  “Paul Among Jews and Gentiles” (1976)  and “Meanings: The Bible as Document and as Guide” (1984)  he replied: “The Christian Bible includes sayings that have caused much pain  both to Jews and to women. Thus I have felt called to seek forms of interpretation which can counteract such undesirable side effects of the Holy Scriptures.”After his term as bishop of Stockholm  in the late 1980s  Stendahl returned to HDS to become the School’s first chaplain  a much more important undertaking than the title at first suggested  given the ethos of religious pluralism  and related pedagogical approach  that had developed further at HDS in the 1980s. At the time  Stendahl explained his vision for his new assignment: “In our community there is no one form  name  or liturgy which can claim the allegiance of all. To be a chaplain in this place therefore must mean to help worship happen in many forms at many times and to guard fiercely the freedom of every person to pray and speak in ways important to him or her — lest the specter of ‘pluralism’ mute authentic expression of devotion.”Stendahl received many significant awards in his lifetime  including the first Distinguished Service Medal from the Association of Theological Schools  in 1988  and  with Gerhart Riegner  the Ladislaus Laszt International Ecumenical Award from Ben-Gurion University in Israel  also in 1988. In 1993  he and Brita Stendahl together received the first Myron B. Bloy Memorial Award from the Association for Religion and Intellectual Life.In recent years  Stendahl was a regular presence at Divinity School events  sitting in the front row in the Sperry Room and often asking penetrating questions. He was also a regular visitor to the offices of HDS faculty and staff alike  sitting for a few minutes of chat.In “Why I Love the Bible ” an essay printed in the spring 2007 issue of Harvard Divinity Bulletin  Stendahl concluded with this paragraph: “Finally  let me leave you with a word which is the one that  in my own long love relationship to this book  I want to have in my mind when my end comes. It reads  in 2 Corinthians 3:18  like this — ‘And we all  with unveiled faces  beholding the glory of the Lord  are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.’”Stendahl is survived by his wife  Brita; his sons  John and Daniel; his daughter  Anna Langenfeld; eight grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. A memorial service is planned for Friday  May 16  at 3 p.m.  in Harvard’s Memorial Church.

Knowles memorial service to be held May 30,A memorial service forJeremy R. Knowleswill be held May 30 at 11 a.m. at the Memorial Church. An eminent chemist and longtime leader of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences  Knowles died April 3 at his home in Cambridge  Mass.  after a struggle with cancer.
Jeremy R. Knowles,Jeremy R. Knowles  an eminent chemist and longtime leader of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences  died today (April 3) at his home in Cambridge  after a struggle with cancer.Known for his formidable intellect  his encompassing interests  and his urbane wit  Knowles was a member of the Harvard faculty since 1974 and served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) from 1991 to 2002. From July 2006 through the spring of 2007  he returned to service as Interim Dean  during a pivotal year in which the Faculty undertook major reforms of the general education curriculum in Harvard College.“Jeremy gave this university his complete devotion ” said President Drew Faust. “The whole Harvard family joins in mourning the loss of a singular  irreplaceable spirit  someone who left a huge imprint on the university he loved and on countless people who will always remember his warmth  his incisive intelligence  and his passion for education. From the time I arrived at Harvard in 2001  Jeremy was a mentor and a dear friend. I will miss him enormously.”The memorial service for Knowles will be at 11 a.m. Friday  May 30  in Memorial Church.Born in England in 1935  Knowles was educated at Magdalen College School  Oxford. After serving as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force  he graduated from Balliol College  receiving his B.A. in 1959 and his D.Phil. in 1961. Before coming to Harvard  he was Fellow and Tutor of Wadham College  Oxford. He held a post-doctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology  and was a visiting professor at Yale  and Sloan Visiting Professor at Harvard. He joined the Harvard faculty as professor of chemistry in 1974  and was named Amory Houghton Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1979.His deanship  spanning more than a decade  was marked by major initiatives to foster academic community and build faculty strength across the humanities  natural sciences  and social sciences  to augment financial aid for both undergraduate and graduate students  and to enhance the physical and financial resources of the FAS. (For more on Knowles’s deanship  seewww.hno.harvard.edu/specials/2002/knowles/.)“Deans and leaders like Jeremy come only rarely ” said former President Neil L. Rudenstine. “He had a penetrating mind. He had wit and charm and taste. Above all  he understood the nature of a university and what it meant to search for knowledge  or discover even a single truth. The standard could never be too high. Many other things mattered  of course. But if learning  teaching  and research were not the heart of the matter  why were we here? Once he had decided to leave his lab  and serve the University in more than chemistry  nothing less than all his energy and stamina would do. He was no less a friend. If there was a need for more than mere intelligence or skill  he was there  with his strength and his commitment.”“Jeremy Knowles was a dear friend  a widely admired scientist  and a leader of exceptional ability and exceptional devotion to Harvard ” said former President Derek Bok. “Along with unfailing wit and charm  he possessed enormous energy and the highest intellectual and ethical standards. His final year of service as a dean must surely rank as one of the most selfless acts of loyalty in Harvard’s history. Under very trying circumstances  he succeeded in restoring a badly needed sense of momentum and progress at a critical time for his Faculty. We all owe him an enormous debt.”“Jeremy’s leadership  intellect  and courage have been an inspiration to us all ” says Michael D. Smith  dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. “He guided the FAS with an unwavering dedication to the highest standards of academic excellence and to the University’s highest ideals. His leadership strengthened the FAS immeasurably. He will be greatly missed.”In 2002  he was awarded the Harvard Medal in recognition of his outstanding service to the University. He was named a Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor in 2003.Knowles’s research lay at the intersection of chemistry and biochemistry  and was aimed especially at gaining a detailed understanding of how enzymes catalyze the reactions that sustain life. He made many fundamental discoveries and conceptual advances  including  for example  the demonstration that during evolution the catalytic efficiency of enzymes had increased to the highest possible level. His work was characterized by an exceptional degree of precision and rigor. The author of more than 250 research papers  he advised more than 50 Ph.D. recipients at Oxford and Harvard. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Philosophical Society  and a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He also served as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.His awards included the Charmian Medal  the Bader Award  the Repligen Award  the Prelog Medal  the Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry  and the Nakanishi Prize. He was awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society  and was an honorary fellow of Balliol College and of Wadham College  Oxford. A recipient of honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich  he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 1993.Knowles is survived by his wife  Jane  their children  Sebastian  Julius  and Timothy  and seven grandchildren.

Bowen  54  was Straus Center’s deputy director,Craigen Weston Bowen  deputy director of the Straus Center for Conservation at Harvard University’s Fogg Art Museum and an accomplished rock climber and gardener  died at her home in Lexington  Mass.  on March 1  16 months after being diagnosed with cancer. She was 54.She was born Ruth Craigen Weston on Nov. 10  1953  the daughter of Frederick W. Weston Jr. and the late Ruth L. Weston  and spent her childhood in West Long Branch  N.J.  and Rome  Maine. At Smith College  she double-majored in art and astronomy  with a minor in physics  and developed into a talented lithographer.After graduating in 1975  she began a three-year apprenticeship in the conservation laboratory at the Fogg under Marjorie B. Cohn  specializing in the conservation of works of art on paper. She later collaborated with Cohn on scholarly projects. In 1978  Bowen moved to the Williamstown Regional Conservation Laboratory at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown  Mass.  where she founded the paper conservation laboratory. In 1980  she returned to the Fogg. That same year  she married Mark S. Bowen  whose family owns a home on the same lake in Maine as hers.Craigen Bowen was the recipient of an Indo-U.S. subcommission grant to travel to Kota  India  in 1987  and made several subsequent trips there to treat and study the royal collections of H.H. Maharao Brijraj Singh in the Rao Madho Singh Trust Museum. In 1994  the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard awarded her the certificate of distinction in teaching. This month (March 2008)  she was awarded the prestigious Sheldon and Caroline Keck Award by the American Institute for Conservation  which recognizes a sustained record of excellence in the education and training of conservation professionals. At the time of her death  in addition to her role as deputy director of the laboratory  Bowen held an endowed position as Philip and Lynn Straus Conservator of Works of Art on Paper at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. The Craigen W. Bowen Fellowship was established in her honor in 2007 to fund the further training of young conservation and curatorial professionals who specialize in works on paper.Bowen was an avid rock climber and mountaineer. During her Harvard apprenticeship  she took the spring rock climbing program offered by the Appalachian Mountain Club  cutting her teeth at small crags around Boston  such as the Quincy Quarries  Rattlesnake Rocks  and Crow Hill. She became known for her fierce determination and masterful technique  especially with her feet. At that time women usually played a secondary role to men in the ascent of difficult climbs  and there were few all-women teams. She was among a handful of women who broke that mold. In “Yankee Rock and Ice  A History of Climbing in the Northeastern United States ” by Laura and Guy Waterman  Bowen and her dear friend Beverly Boynton are cited for climbing difficult routes “with authority and style.” (These words might describe Bowen’s approach to all her endeavors.)Over the course of nearly 30 years  she climbed extensively in North America and Mexico with a core group of friends and made lasting connections with many others. She enjoyed all aspects of the sport: the climbing  the relaxed days between  sitting in the sun  cooking great meals  sharing “war stories” with friends  and even the dark nights huddled in the rain on cold mountaintops or spectacularly high cliffs. She was most proud of her ascents in the Bugaboo Group in British Columbia  Wyoming’s Wind River Range  and  shortly before her 40th birthday  the multiday  3 000-foot Salathe Wall  on Yosemite Valley’s El Capitan  which has been called the most beautiful climb in the world.Among her many interests and talents  Bowen was an imaginative cook  expert skier and waterskier  prolific knitter  and implacable organizer and taskmaster. She took great pleasure in gardening  reading  and  later in life  learning to play the piano. Her children  nieces  and nephews fondly remember many summers in Maine under her tutelage  hauling brush  moving rocks (some more than once)  having the climbers up for weekends  laughing  and playing cards.Bowen is survived by her children  Andrew and Anna Bowen  of Lexington  Mass.  and Arlington  Mass.; her partner  James W. Evans  of Watertown  Mass.; her father  Frederick W. Weston Jr.  of Belgrade Lakes  Maine; her sister  Martha Weston Feldmann of East Greenwich  R.I.; her brother  Frederick W. Weston III of Waterbury  Vt.; friend and former husband  Mark S. Bowen  of Arlington  Mass.; and legions of devoted cousins  colleagues  and friends.A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. on March 22 in the Calderwood Courtyard at the Fogg Art Museum on the campus of Harvard University.

Charles William Dunn,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences February 12  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Charles William Dunn was born in 1915 in Arbuthnott  Scotland  a small village in Aberdeenshire a few miles from the North Sea  where his father was the Presbyterian minister. The family moved  as his father’s appointments took them  to Aberdeen  to Edinburgh  and eventually  like so many other Scots  to North America. He arrived in Boston at the age of twelve  and subsequently moved with his family to Ontario  where he attended McMaster University. Like any good Gael  he was fundamentally shaped by the places in which he lived. He never lost his attachment to the Scottish countryside  its people  its ways  its stories  and all of its languages—Gaelic  Scots and English. On this side of the Atlantic  he would recover that world in Cape Breton  where he studied every dimension of the life of The Highland Settler in a book that has been described as a uniquely comprehensive introduction to Nova Scotia Gaelic culture  still fundamental after more than a half century. But he was as well the consummately urbane denizen of two of the English-speaking world’s most literate and literary cities  Edinburgh and Cambridge  a dedicated clubman and passionate book collector  witty  charming  and gregarious.Charles first came to Harvard as a graduate student. He studied with Fred Norris Robinson  the great Chaucerian who also introduced the study of medieval Irish and Welsh to Harvard; with Francis Peabody Magoun  the distinguished philologist of English and especially of its place names who was also a translator of Grimms’ folktales and an eager student of medieval Finnish literature; with B. J. Whiting  another eminent Chaucerian who also taught medieval French literature and the Middle Scots poets at Harvard  and who was a leading scholar of the proverb and its history. From the outset  Charles made plain his own seamless interest in both oral tradition and medieval texts  writing his dissertation on the folkloric and historical backgrounds to the twelfth-century Old French romance Guillaume de Palerne and its translations into English and Irish. That work was published as The Foundling and the Werwolf. In the tradition of his teachers  Charles became a wide-ranging medievalist: he wrote about Le Roman de la Rose  the Poetic Edda  and the Historia Regum Britanniae; he compiled a fine anthology of Middle English literature  and with his friend Morton Bloomfield wrote a study of The Role of the Poet in Early Societies.Charles was enamored of spoken language  and in 1958 and 1959 he made two recordings for Folkways Records. One was designed to illustrate the history of the English language and includes  among other things  renderings of the parable of the prodigal son in Old  Middle  Early Modern  and Modern English and in Scottish dialect; the other is an anthology of readings from Old and Middle English poetry.His overarching love  though  was for Scottish Gaelic poetry and narrative tradition  and for the narrative and lyric literature of the other Celtic languages as well. Throughout his teaching career  which included appointments at Cornell  the University of Toronto  and New York University  he worked to put the literature and traditions of the Celtic languages on an equal footing with those of the Germanic and Romance languages in the study of the European Middle Ages. In 1963  he returned to Harvard to continue that work as the third chairman of the Celtic Department  and in 1967 he was named to the Margaret Brooks Robinson Professorship of Celtic Languages and Literatures  endowed by Fred Norris Robinson  his first teacher of those languages. He was chair of the department for twenty years  until his retirement in 1984.When Charles took over the chairmanship of the Department  Celtic studies barely existed within the American constellation of humanities subjects; ten years later  his students were teaching at universities throughout the country and overseas; within fifteen years  they had established the Celtic Studies Association of North America  with an annual conference that attracts scholars from around the world and a respected annual publication. The range of his interests allowed his students to broaden the definition of the field by pursuing research in areas as diverse as contemporary oral tradition  medieval versecraft  manuscript studies  and dialectology.In 1966  Charles became Master of Quincy House  and brought to that role too his love of Scottish tradition and his gift for good fellowship. No one who was associated with the house during the fifteen years that he was there will forget him  resplendent in his kilt  following the piper in the annual “beating of the bounds” of Quincy House. No one will forget the way that his distinctive jovial laughter suffused his hospitable gatherings of faculty  graduates  undergraduates and visitors in the Master’s residence. Charles understood instinctively that the life of the mind flourishes when senior scholars from various disciplines  college students  and graduates enjoy one another’s company and an occasional Scottish country dance. He had a gift for the creation of community that proved to be invaluable during the course of the political tumult that threatened to overwhelm Harvard and other universities in the late 1960s.He was a tall and handsome man  with a mass of wavy golden hair and a bearing that did credit to both his tweeds and his kilt. His classes and his parties sparkled with the breadth of his knowledge  the variety of dialects that he could deploy at the drop of a hat  an impeccable sense of dramatic timing  and his inimitable laugh. He died on July 24  2006  at the age of ninety. He is survived by his wife  Elaine Birnbaum Dunn  and three children  Peter Dunn  Deirdre Dunn Strachan  and Alexander Dunn  as well as two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Patrick K.

George Francis Carrier,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences February 12  2008  the following Minute was placed upon the records.George Francis Carrier  T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Applied Mathematics  Emeritus  at Harvard University  one of the world’s leading applied mathematicians  died of esophageal cancer in his 84th year  on March 8  2002.He was born in Millinocket  Maine  on May 4  1918. His father was a chemical engineer and manager of the Great Northern paper mill in Millinocket. As a teenager  George was a guide in his beloved Maine woods; he worked summer jobs at the mill without his father’s knowledge. Following in his father’s footsteps  he attended Cornell University  where he received a Masters of Engineering degree in 1939 and Ph.D. in 1944  working with Professor Norman Goodier. An accomplished clarinet and ocarina player  he organized a jazz band at Cornell and worked as a houseman at a local pool hall.In graduate school at Cornell  George contracted tuberculosis and spent a year in a sanitarium breathing fresh air and studying books on advanced mathematics. He then returned to graduate school where he taught courses in mechanical drawing and mechanisms and the first advanced course in applied mathematics for engineers at Cornell. Two students in the latter course  Julian Cole and Ivar Stackgold  said they first heard about asymptotics and perturbations analysis in that course and believed that experience had shaped their careers (they both became distinguished professors of applied mathematics).George began his technical career in 1944 as a research engineer working for Harvard’s Professor Howard Emmons on the flow of compressible fluids. George helped design and build a high-speed cascade wind tunnel for the study of jet engine turbines and compressor blades. He was a good experimenter  but his extraordinary mathematical-modeling and analysis capabilities set him apart. Emmons proposed him for a faculty position but was overruled by the rather formal Professor Richard von Mises who thought George was “too much of a wise guy.” So George went off to Brown University  where he quickly set the academic world on fire.Stories of George’s intellectual exploits at Brown abound. He worked with 14 Ph.D. students and is reported to have given a fall course on complex variables that ended by Thanksgiving. In response to complaints  he gave the entire course again by the end of the term. After only five years  he was promoted to full professor.In 1952  he was invited back to Harvard (von Mises had retired) as Gordon McKay Professor of Mechanical Engineering. In 1972  he was appointed T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Applied Mathematics. He had 24 Ph.D. students at Harvard  many of whom went on to pursue distinguished careers in applied mathematics. He became an emeritus professor in 1988 but continued his research with two original research papers published after his death.George was widely considered one of the best applied mathematicians the United States ever produced. He loved applied problems with complex mathematical models  for which he found ingenious approximations and asymptotic results. He had a quick mind and remarkable physical intuition  which made him much sought after as a consultant to business and government. He could listen to the description of a problem and come up with the solution or an effective approach to the solution in minutes. Almost every summer for 40 years  he was a consultant to either the Los Alamos National Laboratory or the Space and Defense Group at TRW in California; both organizations considered him the ideal consultant. Among his many accomplishments at TRW (according to his former Ph.D. student and co-author Frank Fendell) were: (1) showing how a spinning spacecraft could be controlled with a tuned liquid damper (jointly with John Miles of UCSD); (2) showing how to contend with vortexing during rapid drainage of a propellant tank; and (3) showing how ceiling sprinkler systems might kill people by keeping smoke near the floor. His good friend and distinguished aerodynamicist  Hans Liepmann of Caltech  described him as “the greatest problem solver ever!”George’s favorite subject was wave propagation  and in the 1960s he taught a graduate course with this description: “Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) investigations in the propagation of waves in various media.” The dean of the faculty objected  but George persisted  arguing that the description was absolutely accurate. Harry Yeh  a distinguished oceanographer  told how George stimulated his and others’ research on tsunamis by pointing out  among other things  that even the Pacific Ocean is too small for a tsunami to evolve into a soliton (solitary wave) through dispersive effects. George provided analytical solutions with simple geometry for the tsunami run-up problem that could be used to check computer simulations with more complicated geometries. George also showed that the eye-formation is a critical feature of the thermal ocean-air interaction in hurricanes.George was elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953  the National Academy of Sciences in 1967  the National Academy of Engineering in 1974  and the American Philosophical Society in 1976. He received the President’s Medal of Science in 1990 with the following citation: “For his achievement and leadership in the mathematical modeling of significant problems of engineering science and geophysics and their solution by the application of innovative and powerful analytical techniques.” He also received many other awards and honors  including the Dryden Medal of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  the Fluid Dynamics Prize of the American Physical Society  the Timoshenko Medal and Silver Centennial Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  the National Academy of Sciences Award in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis  the von Karman Medal of the American Society of Civil Engineers  and both the John von Neumann Lectureship and von Karman Prize of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.George served with distinction on at least 27 committees and panels of the National Research Council of the National Academies  including the Executive Committee of the Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences  Naval Studies Board  Executive Committee of the Assembly of Engineering  and Advisory Board of the Office of Mathematical Sciences. He was also an associate editor of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics and the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics.George authored or co-authored more than 110 technical papers on fluid mechanics  solid mechanics  heat transfer  radiation  stochastic systems  oceanography  and mathematical techniques. In these papers and in his consulting work  he made outstanding contributions to the understanding of tsunamis  hurricanes  water waves  and singular-perturbation theory. He also co-authored Functions of a Complex Variable: Theory and Technique with Carl E. Pearson and Max Krook  and co-authored with Pearson both Ordinary Differential Equations and Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Technique.George had boundless energy  a cheerful nature  and was master of his emotions. He knew how to put a fractious committee at ease with a lighthearted remark. He had no appetite for prestige  position  or wealth. He was unfailingly honest  always did what he thought was right  and was quick to admit when he was wrong or made a mistake. He chose to work on technical problems for their usefulness and for the fun he could have. Despite his extraordinary accomplishments  he managed to remain modest and “human.” He served Harvard as a member of the Administrative Board of the College  as acting dean of the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences  and as chair of the Committee on Applied Mathematics for many years. In 2005 a fellowship was established in his honor  to be awarded “to a scholar of engineering and applied sciences with a special emphasis in widely applied mathematics.”George was also known for his high jinks. On one occasion  he arranged to have the dean of engineering arrested for a parking violation during the annual Christmas party. On another occasion  during a seminar on guided missiles  he and a prestigious MIT professor “arrested” the speaker and carried him out of the room for revealing “classified information.” He was fan of the Marx Brothers and shared with colleagues his joy for outrageous puns.He loved gardening and building things at his home in Wayland  playing catch with his sons  and dancing with his wife in the living room to a Benny Goodman record. Evenings he enjoyed watching Perry Mason on TV  but after a few minutes his mind would drift  and he would take out a yellow pad of paper and begin writing equations at a furious pace. That way he was able to enjoy Perry Mason for 40 years  according to his son Mark  because he could never remember “who done it.”His wife Mary (nee Casey) died on July 5  2006. She and George were a devoted couple for nearly 60 years of married life. Three sons  Kenneth of Ithaca  New York; Robert of Wayland  Massachusetts; and Mark of Eugene  Oregon; and two grandchildren  McKenzie and Katrina of Eugene  Oregon  survive them.Respectfully submitted Arthur E.

MacLeod  retired director of accounting  passes away,Donald MacLeod  former director of accounting at Harvard University  passed away at his home in Lexington  Mass.  on Feb. 2 after a brief illness. MacLeod retired from Harvard in 1994 following 45 years of service to the University.
Tenney Kelley Lehman  90  headed Nieman Foundation,Tenney K. Lehman  90  died on Jan. 7 at Coolidge House nursing home in Brookline  Mass. She was on the staff of Harvard University’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism from 1968 to 1985  retiring as executive director. Her life was defined by devotion to her family  dedication to finding meaning through poetry and writing  and determination to prevail in the face of illness and other daunting challenges.Lehman was born Tenney Barbara Kelley in Winthrop  Mass.  in 1917. A graduate of Winthrop High School  she worked at the Boston radio station WEEI as an advertising copywriter after completing studies at Chamberlayne Junior College. Her love of words  which started to blossom as she created jingles and slogans for clients such as Andy Boy Broccoli  stayed with her throughout her life. From her teenage years  she took pleasure in writing short stories and poetry.She married Thomas H. Lehman in 1941.From the first time she and Tom visited Martha’s Vineyard in 1953  they fell in love with the island. In the Franklin Street rectory  Tenney provided hospitality to parishioners and visitors to the Vineyard while her husband tended the flock of the Episcopal Parish on Martha’s Vineyard. The Lehmans soon purchased land in Gay Head and built a small home there where they retreated for days off  and later  vacations. When the Rev. Lehman was called to be rector of Grace Church  in Newton  Mass.  in 1959  the couple maintained their Vineyard connection  spending vacations and summers there and returning as year-round residents after retiring in 1986.In Newton  Lehman began to explore the new possibilities opened to her. She took classes at Northeastern  Simmons  and Brandeis  then started work with a temporary employment agency. One of her first assignments was at Harvard University’s Nieman Foundation  where she assisted curator Dwight Sargent. Her secretarial and administrative skills and warm personality led to her being hired as a permanent employee; within a matter of years she was named executive director by curator James C. Thomson. In that role  she served as editor of Nieman Reports  enlarging the scope of the quarterly publication  guiding its editorial direction  and contributing a reflective column to each issue. In addition  she handled alumni/ae relations with the journalists from the United States and overseas who participated in the sabbatical program  and she took the lead in administering the selection process for each year’s new class of fellows.At their Aquinnah home on Martha’s Vineyard  Tenney Lehman delighted in nature  joyously greeting spring’s first mayflowers and discovering with glee jack-in-the-pulpits  Indian pipes  and lady-slippers hidden deep in the woods. In the summer  she took pleasure in picking high-bush blueberries to make pie and beach plums to make jelly. Year round  she was an avid birdwatcher.Tenney was at her happiest when “working on something” with yellow legal pad and black pen — her preferred method of writing and editing; she long ago gave up her typewriter and never used a computer. As she faced numerous health and other challenges  she sought to find meaning in life’s mysteries and sorrows through her writing. Many people — including  in later years  some of her physicians — were grateful recipients of poems she composed specifically for them.Her husband died in 1998 and their son  Richard  died in 2004. Tenney is survived by her daughter  the Rev. Daphne B. Noyes  of Cambridge; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Cassem Professorship in Psychiatry Fund at Massachusetts General Hospital  55 Fruit St.  Boston  MA 02114.
Scientist  educator Ehrenreich dies at 79,A pioneer in semiconductor materials and a Harvard professor for more than four decades  Henry Ehrenreich  Clowes Professor of Science Emeritus  died on Jan. 20  a few months before his 80th birthday. Ehrenreich served as the University’s first ombudsman and extended his academic interests to government and public policy  spending a year working with the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and serving on several national and international panels.“An enormous number of colleagues  friends  and students at Harvard and throughout the world have benefited from their interactions with Henry as well as from … the volumes he edited. His insights  wisdom  and thoughtfulness will be sorely missed ” said Paul Martin  John H. Van Vleck Professor of Pure and Applied Physics.Ehrenreich received his B.A. (1950) and his Ph.D. in the emerging field of semiconductor physics (1955) at Cornell  where he also met and married Tema  his wife of almost 55 years. He then spent eight years at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady  N.Y. In 1963 he was appointed a professor in the Harvard Division (now School) of Engineering and Applied Sciences.“Over the course of his academic career  as the flood of uses of semiconductor devices continued to grow  he published roughly 200 papers ” said long-time collaborator Peter Pershan  Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science. “He was a master at understanding  explaining  and predicting the electronic and optical properties of the ever-more-complex ingredients of these devices.”At Harvard  Ehrenreich  a popular and widely praised researcher  mentor  and educator  did much to promote and improve undergraduate education in science and engineering  chairing the Science Center Executive Committee and the Core Committee on Science from 1987 to 1999. As director of Harvard’s Material Research Laboratory (now the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center) from 1982 to 1990  he fostered enduring collaborative interdisciplinary courses and research programs.Ehrenreich was editor or co-editor of more than 30 volumes of Solid State Physics  a renowned and widely consulted annual review of major advances in solid-state science and technology. He served on and chaired numerous national and international committees  including the Solid State Commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics for 10 years and the Department of Defense’s DARPA Materials Council for 20.Ehrenreich was also a skilled pianist. He developed his love for music early  thanks to his father  a choral conductor and music critic.In addition to his wife  Tema  Ehrenreich leaves a daughter  Beth  two sons  Paul and Robert  and 10 grandchildren.A service for Ehrenreich was held Jan. 22 at the Levine Chapels in Brookline  Mass. Donations in his memory can be made to the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies  U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum  Washington  D.C.
Cancer research pioneer Judah Folkman dies suddenly at 74,Cancer research pioneer Judah Folkman  the Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery and professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS)  died on Jan. 14 of a heart attack. Folkman  who was also the director of the Vascular Biology Program at Children’s Hospital Boston  was 74.Folkman had a brilliant  if contentious  career. Nobody believed him when  in the 1960s  he claimed that the growth of cancers could be stopped  even reversed  by blocking the tiny vessels that feed them blood. Over the years  however  he survived peer rejection of his theory and went on to develop drugs that did what he predicted they would do.Folkman  who was born in Cleveland in 1933  showed his promise early; there were even intimations that he would some day revolutionize medicine when  in high school  he made a crude machine to keep a rat’s heart pumping blood. During his medical training in the 1950s  Folkman and another student built an implantable pacemaker to shock weakened hearts back into a normal rhythm.Graduating cum laude from Ohio State University  Columbus  in 1953  Folkman went on to Harvard Medical School  where  in 1957  he graduated magna cum laude. His surgical residency was spent at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1964 and 1965  he served as chief resident in surgery there.In the early 1960s  as a lieutenant in the Navy  Folkman co-developed silicone rubber implantable polymers for the sustained release of drugs  work that launched the field of controlled-release technology and led to the development of Norplant  a birth-control method for women.It was also while he was serving in the Navy that Folkman made the discovery that came to dominate his life. In 1961  he and a colleague noticed that malignant mouse tumors implanted into isolated organs never grow beyond the size of a pinhead. But replant those tumors into the bodies of live animals  and they expand rapidly. From this  Folkman came up with the then-radical idea that tumors secrete proteins able to stimulate the growth of hair-thin blood vessels that bring them nutrients and carry away their wastes. He applied the name “angiogenesis ” meaning “birth of blood vessels ” to this process.Today  no scientist or physician doubts the existence of angiogenesis or its role in cancer  but in the early 1970s Folkman’s idea was heavily criticized. “Fantasy ” some experts labeled it.It was in a 1971 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine that Folkman put forward the hypothesis that all tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent. The paper founded a new field of scientific inquiry: angiongenesis research. Folkman’s laboratory initiated clinical trials of antiangiogenic therapy. Angiogenesis inhibitors have since received FDA approval for the treatment of cancer and macular degeneration. Twenty-seven other countries in addition to the United States have approved these drugs. Folkman’s research has succeeded in placing antiangiogenic therapy on a firm scientific foundation.By 1997  Folkman and his colleagues at Boston’s Children’s Hospital found a natural compound they called endostatin  which blocks the growth of blood vessels and shrinks tumors without the usual harsh side effects of chemotherapy.Folkman wrote nearly 400 original peer-reviewed papers and more than 100 book chapters and monographs. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Philosophical Society  and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He held honorary degrees from 15 universities and is the recipient of numerous national and international awards.He had a distinguished teaching career. After his role as an instructor in surgery for Harvard’s Surgical Service at Boston City Hospital  he was promoted to Professor of Surgery at HMS  and became the Julia Dyckman Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery in 1968. From 1967 he served as surgeon-in-chief at Children’s Hospital Boston for 14 years.A longtime resident of Brookline  Mass.  Folkman is survived by his wife  the former Paula Prial (of Fall River  Mass.)  daughters Laura and Marjorie  and one granddaughter.
Classicist  Loeb Library trustee Stewart dies at 86,Distinguished American classicist Zeph Stewart  who was the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities Emeritus at Harvard University  passed away at his home in Watertown  Mass.  on Dec. 1 at 86.Stewart was associated with Harvard for 60 years  beginning with his arrival as a graduate student in classics in 1947. Over the course of his career he was at various times a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows  master of Lowell House  professor of Greek and Latin  chairman of the Department of the Classics  trustee of the Loeb Classical Library  director of Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington  D.C.  and a trustee of the Episcopal chaplaincy at Harvard. In addition  he was president of both the American Philological Association and the Teachers of Classics in New England.Born on Jan. 1  1921  in Jackson  Mich.  Stewart was the son of a prominent political family and younger brother of Potter Stewart  who later became a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Like his brother before him  Zeph Stewart attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville  Conn.; he was a member of the class of 1939. In later life  as was typical of him  he served as a trustee of the school and received the 1964 Alumni Award. After Hotchkiss  Stewart went on to Yale  where he graduated with highest honors in classics in December 1942.In January 1943  Stewart entered the Army  having been recruited for his linguistic skills by Edwin O. Reischauer. He learned Japanese and did two stints of service  first working in the area of military intelligence. During these years (1943–47)  spent initially in Washington  D.C.  and then in London and Paris  he went from private to captain. He was recalled for active duty during the Korean War (1951–53) as part of a NATO delegation  working on diplomatic liaison  again in London and Paris.In 1953  Stewart joined the faculty of Harvard’s Department of the Classics as assistant professor of Greek and Latin  and began to pursue his research and publishing work in Latin literature and manuscript studies. His early endeavors were centered on some of the major Latin authors  including Virgil  Horace  and Plautus  and he dealt also with paleographical issues. He had a lifelong interest in Greek philosophy and religion  particularly the transition to Christianity. He edited several volumes in these areas  most notably the “Essays on Religion and the Ancient World of Arthur Darby Nock” (Oxford  1972).In each of the many appointments he held  Stewart immediately set about to improve the intellectual  communal  and fiscal aspects of the institution in question. He did so because he cared about the field of classics  about libraries  about teaching and research — and about the well-being of colleagues and students at all levels.Jeffrey Henderson of Boston University  the present general editor of the Loeb Classical Library  fondly remembers Stewart as “teacher  mentor  and true friend for nearly 40 years.” He recalls the crucial role his mentor played — as executive trustee of the library for over a quarter of a century — in helping to develop a renewal plan in the 1970s to put the Loeb Library on a sound financial footing. “Indispensable ” according to Henderson  “were Zeph’s vision and respect for what the library should be  his keen judgment about the right projects and the right scholars to tackle each one  and his matchless tact and skill at recruiting potential authors  or letting them down gently when they were not right for the job.”Richard Thomas of Harvard’s Classics Department  who succeeded Stewart as executive trustee of the library  points to the direct and impressive result of this reordering and revitalization  namely  the establishment of the Loeb Classical Library Foundation  which currently provides considerable financial assistance for the research of classicists worldwide.As master of Lowell House  Stewart greatly emphasized the importance of community. He welcomed the advent of women into the house. He endeavored to modernize the college rules and regulations  and was particularly successful in integrating Harvard faculty into the life of the house.Stewart became renowned for his administrative skills and financial expertise. Over the years he held eight different appointments in offices and on committees of the American Philological Association (APA). Adam Blistein  the current executive director of the APA  recalls the immediate and dramatic effect of Stewart’s impact as financial trustee of the association. Ward Briggs of the University of South Carolina and a serving financial trustee of the APA credits him largely with radical changes that helped to restore the finances to a robust condition.Stewart was president of the American Philological Association (1983); a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (vice president 1979–82); and visiting professor at Hamilton College and the University of Colorado. In 2000  he received the Barlow-Beach Award of the Classical Association of New England “for exceptional service to the Classics in New England.”He is survived by his wife  Diana  with whom he offered cherished hospitality to successive generations of scholars and students  and by two daughters  Sarah and Mary  a son  Christopher  and two grandchildren. 0
David Maybury-Lewis  eminent anthropologist and scholar  78,David Maybury-Lewis  a Harvard anthropologist who served as a tireless advocate for indigenous cultures and peoples  died Dec. 2 at his home in Cambridge  Mass. He was 78.Maybury-Lewis passed away after a long  difficult struggle with Parkinson’s disease  according to his family.A social anthropologist with a towering international reputation  Maybury-Lewis was a deeply committed supporter of the rights of the peoples that he studied. He worked extensively with central Brazilian Indian peoples affected by what he termed “developmentalism”: destructive development projects  of national aDonald Pfister chosen as new dean of Harvard Summer Schoold international origins  that pay little heed to the original peoples and the environments in which they live.“David Maybury-Lewis brought attention to the very critical matter of cultures being destroyed by globalization and industrialization ” says Nur Yalman  professor of social anthropology and Middle Eastern studies emeritus at Harvard. “He was pioneering in this area. The world’s native peoples have benefited greatly from his life’s work.”In 1972  to help protect the rights of native peoples  Maybury-Lewis  his Danish-born wife  Pia  and colleagues on the Harvard faculty co-founded Cultural Survival  a Cambridge-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the human rights of indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities. It remains widely regarded as the premier institution of its kind in the United States. Partnering with indigenous peoples to support their rights and to preserve their land  resources  language  and culture  Cultural Survival has worked to assist populations in North and South America  Africa  Asia  and Europe.Maybury-Lewis was president of Cultural Survival until his passing. For their advocacy work  David and Pia Maybury-Lewis received the American Anthropological Association’s Distinguished Service Award in 1988. David Maybury-Lewis was also awarded the Anders Retzuis Gold Medal of the Swedish Society of Anthropology and Geography in 1998.“Recognizing how economic development programs often led to the destruction of the rainforest and the exploitation of the peoples of the lowlands  he helped build a field committed to supporting alternative forms of development that would protect the rights and the interests of such peoples ” says Byron Good  professor of medical anthropology at Harvard Medical School. “He founded a specialized program in development studies within the Department of Anthropology at Harvard  designed to educate a cadre of scholars who could change the direction of the global organizations investing in development projects throughout the world.”Maybury-Lewis joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1960 as an instructor in social anthropology  becoming an assistant professor in 1961. He was appointed Edward C. Henderson Professor of Anthropology in 1969 and chair of the Harvard Anthropology Department between 1973 and 1981. He also served as the curator of South American Ethnology in Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology from 1966 to 2004  when he retired from the University.In the late 1960s and early 1970s  Maybury-Lewis led the Harvard-Central Brazil Project. With Harvard and Brazilian social scientists  this project not only documented  through a series of detailed ethnographies  the interrelationships between the cultures of the various tribal peoples of central Brazil  it also helped lay the groundwork for modern anthropology in Brazil. Maybury-Lewis and his Brazilian collaborators went on to found graduate programs in anthropology in Rio de Janeiro and in sociology in the northeastern Brazilian city of Recife.Maybury-Lewis’ colleagues and students at that time are now among Brazil’s senior social scientists  and the institutions he helped found thrive to this day. For that and for his pioneering research in general  he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Scientific Merit  Brazil’s highest academic honor  in 1997.Born May 5  1929  in Hyderabad  Sindh  under the British Raj in what today is Pakistan  Maybury-Lewis was the son of a civil engineer in the British Civil Service. His father’s post in the remote Sindhi desert building dams and canals acquainted Maybury-Lewis  from his very earliest days  with the confrontation of modern and traditional ways  high technology and backwardness  empires and subjects  and culture clashes: the contradictory issues that would be the object of his life’s work at Harvard.Maybury-Lewis attended King’s School Canterbury  an English boarding school. From 1948 to 1949  he served as a British army officer in the West Yorkshire Regiment. He went on to study modern languages at Cambridge  eventually becoming fluent in nine languages  including two central Brazilian indigenous languages. He received his M.A. in social sciences at the University of São Paulo  and his D.Phil. in anthropology from Oxford University in 1960.His doctorate  based on groundbreaking work among the Shavante of central Brazil  was published as the ethnography “Akwï-Shavante Society” (Clarendon Press  1967).“His courses covered a broad range of subjects from the intricacies of kinship analysis to foundations of social theory ” says James J. Fox  professor at the Australian National University and former member of Harvard’s Anthropology Department. “His lectures were stunningly well-prepared and authoritatively delivered. His intellectual interests mirrored his course offerings. Brazil was always a key interest of his  but some of his most probing research focused on the nature of dual organization and its prevalence throughout the world.”The author of eight scholarly books and innumerable articles  Maybury-Lewis’ first book  “The Savage and the Innocent ” was published in 1965. A popular classic on the challenges facing anthropologists conducting “fieldwork” among tribal peoples  the book documented Maybury-Lewis’ and his family’s time living among the Sherente and the hunter/gatherer Shavante peoples of Brazil between 1955 and 1958  detailing the Indians’ response to contact with outside cultures.“In the 1960s there was growing recognition and interest in the relationship between the cognitive structures of people and the societies in which they lived  and he contributed greatly to this discussion ” Yalman says. “He was one of the really important figures in the structuralist tradition in anthropology  and his work in Brazil contributed mightily to the refinement of the theories of Levi-Strauss  one of the towering figures in 20th century social sciences.”In 1992  Maybury-Lewis hosted a popular Public Broadcasting System series titled “Millennium: Tribal Wisdom and the Modern World ” also writing a companion book by the same name. The series  which aired over 10 weeks  covered such universal themes as death  romantic love  spirituality  and friendship  depicting the lives of indigenous peoples from 15 different countries around the world.“David applied this same spirit of engaged anthropology to his remarkable film series ” says J. Lorand Matory  professor of anthropology and of African and African American studies at Harvard. “More than any other anthropologist since Margaret Mead  David brought the wisdom and the worth of other lifeways into the living rooms of hundreds of thousands.”Always an advocate  but never patronizing of the people he studied  in a 1992 interview with the Harvard Gazette  Maybury-Lewis said of the television series  “What I wanted to do was show how other people live so that we could think about how we live.”“He was a brilliant  brilliant orator; very witty  very fair  and very noble ” Yalman says. Yalman recalls Maybury-Lewis playing a central role in a long-running Christmastime tradition in Adams House  a Harvard dormitory with which he was associated since the mid-1960s: annually joining a group of distinguished Harvard professors in tuxedos who would read aloud  after the holiday dinner  a chapter from “Winnie-the-Pooh” to the celebrating students. In his august Oxfordian accent  Maybury-Lewis read the part of the narrator.“A memorable feature of his deep involvement with life at Harvard ” Fox says  “was his collegiality and conviviality. He and his wife regularly held a Sunday evening open house at which students and faculty of every sort gathered for good food and excellent conversation.”“As a colleague  David seemed to take an example from the men in the lowland South American societies that he so admired ” Matory says. “He led by example  by inspiration  and by elegant persuasion  not by dictation or bullying. His was a strong presence. He had a way with the deftly chosen and encouraging word.”David Maybury-Lewis is survived by his wife  Pia; two sons  Biorn (Harvard ’80) of Cambridge  Mass.  and Anthony (Harvard ’83) of London; and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at Harvard in March.
Sidney Coleman dies at 70,Sidney Richard Coleman  a member of the Harvard faculty for 43 years and a giant of theoretical physics  died on Nov. 18 after a five-year struggle with Parkinson’s disease. He was 70.Nobel Prize winner and former Harvard colleague Steven Weinberg  now professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Texas  said  “I always thought that Sidney Coleman understood modern theoretical physics better than anyone else. One of the many issues that he was able to illuminate was the process by which the universe makes a transition from an apparently stable state to a state of lower energy. According to the groundbreaking work of Coleman and his students  bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ appear here and there in a background of ‘false vacuum.’ This process is now believed to have occurred several times in the early history of our universe  pretty much as described by Coleman.”For 30 years  Coleman taught Physics 253  “Quantum Field Theory ” to a standing-room-only crowd. His legendary lectures  known for their clarity  insight  and dry wit  inspired a whole generation of young physicists.He had his eccentricities  however  and everyone has a favorite “Sidney story.”In the 1960s  he threatened to sue a student publication for calumny  because they said he taught physics in a purple polyester suit. “It was wool ” he sniffed.A denizen of the old Harvard Square  before his marriage Coleman could usually be found long past midnight at Hayes-Bickford cafeteria arguing physics with his friends. Famously nocturnal  he refused to teach a 9 a.m. class because  he said  “I can’t stay up that late.”Coleman was born on March 7  1937  in Chicago. He was the son of a businessman who died when the boy was 9. He  his mother  and his infant brother fell on hard times and lived in a tough neighborhood in Chicago. According to his brother  Robert L. Coleman  in the 1940s  Sidney became interested in the building of the atomic bomb and declared his ambition to become a physicist. In high school  he and a friend built a primitive computer and won the Chicago Science Fair.He developed a passion for science fiction  and  at 18  became a founder of Advent: Publishers  which publishes critical works about science fiction. Greg Benford  a well-known science-fiction writer and another of the founders  remarks that Coleman’s reviews of science fiction often influenced the writers and that sci-fi perhaps influenced the titles of Coleman’s scientific articles  for example the renowned “Why There Is Nothing Rather Than Something: A Theory of the Cosmological Constant ” published in Nuclear Physics B in 1988.Coleman graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1957 and went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)  where he studied with Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann  who directed his thesis. In 1961  at the age of 26  Coleman came to Harvard as the Corning Lecturer and Fellow. He received his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1962  became assistant professor in 1963  Sloan Fellow in 1964  and associate professor in 1966. In 1969  he became a professor of physics and  in 1980  the Donner Professor of Science. He held numerous visiting professorships and received the Dirac Medal and the Dannie Heineman Prize. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.In 1985  Coleman’s book “Aspects of Symmetry: Selected Erice Lectures” was published  replacing the treasured but tattered sheaf of class notes that his students had carried around for years.Over the course of his career  Coleman supervised 40 doctoral students. In addition  as Arthur Jaffe  Harvard’s Landon T. Clay Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Science  said  “Everybody was Sidney’s student; the faculty were also his students. … He was ‘the Oracle.’ He could synthesize all the ideas he came across and point everybody in a good direction.” In his Nobel Lecture (given in 2004  when he shared the prize in physics with David Gross and Frank Wilczek)  H. David Politzer called Coleman “my beloved teacher.” The lecture itself was a paean to Coleman’s teaching method  simultaneously exacting and encouraging  persisting through years of problem solving.Coleman loved to travel. Erice  Italy; Cargese in Corsica; and Aspen  Colo. — three summer meeting places for physicists — were constants in Coleman’s travels. It is disputed whether it was he or writer/physicist Jeremy Bernstein who coined the term “Leisure of the Theory Class.” He loved to hike. He loved poker. He founded a poker group in 1972  which continued to meet even in his nursing home.In January 2003  Coleman gave up teaching and took a medical leave. In 2005  to honor him  the Physics Department organized the SidneyFest  which was also a summit of the world’s theoretical physicists. He retired in 2006.He never lost his sense of humor  his wife recounted. Very recently when the activities director in the nursing home said to her about her husband  “He looks like a nice man ” Coleman piped up  “Looks are deceiving.”Coleman leaves his wife of 25 years  Diana T. Coleman of Cambridge  Mass.  and his brother  Robert L. Coleman of Albany  Calif.  and many friends. There will be a memorial gathering at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge  Mass.  in the spring.
David Clarence McClelland,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences October 16  2007  the following Minute was placed upon the records.David Clarence McClelland was a distinguished member of a small cohort of twentieth-century psychologists who brought the objective procedures of empirical inquiry to the complex domain of human personality and motivation. He is best known for his creative use of content analysis of text — especially the interpretations of pictures — to develop quantified measures of the motives for achievement  power  and affiliation  and his application of these variables to the analysis of major social phenomena  including economic development  leadership  and war and peace  and in later years to different aspects of physiological functioning and to the study of health and illness. In this work  he made systematic use of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)  a set of images developed at Harvard by Henry Murray in 1935. The interdisciplinary dimension of McClelland’s work was enhanced during his sabbatical year in Harvard’s Department of Social Relations in 1949–50  which had a decisive effect on his later research interests and the course of his career.McClelland is also known for his critique of the unitary concept of “intelligence” and intelligence tests  and his efforts to identify other forms of competence. This work motivated him to found McBer and Company (currently a part of Hay Associates)  a management research  training and consulting enterprise  focused on the development and utilization of such competencies.Born in 1917 to a father who was a college president and a Methodist minister  McClelland chose Yale for his doctoral studies following graduation from Wesleyan University in 1938 and a master’s degree from the University of Missouri in 1939. McClelland had broad interests. He had studied several languages and had planned to be a language teacher. He wrote a play in Latin  translated Emily Dickinson’s poems into German  and later  at Wesleyan  taught in the all-university humanities program organized by Nathan Pusey.After receiving his Ph.D. in psychology at Yale in 1941  and spending a year as an instructor of psychology at Connecticut College  McClelland joined the faculty at Wesleyan in 1942. During the Second World War he took a position in Philadelphia with the American Friends Service Committee  which was heavily engaged in work with conscientious objectors and refugees. While working with the AFSC  he also served as a part-time lecturer in psychology at Bryn Mawr College (1944–45). The course in personality that he was asked to teach on short notice appears to have had a significant influence on the direction of his scholarly interests.McClelland returned to Wesleyan in 1945 and remained there until 1956. During these years  he became more deeply invested in research on motivation and developed an experimentally based method for scoring TAT responses as a measure of the strength of the achievement motive. Later research used this method to derive measures of a variety of other motives and personality variables. In 1951 he published an empirically based landmark text called Personality. A number of the BA and MA students that McClelland mentored during those early years at Wesleyan became leading figures in the field themselves and many of the doctoral students whom he supervised during his subsequent years at Harvard became intellectual leaders of the next generation of psychologists.McClelland came to Harvard in 1956 as professor of psychology and director of the doctoral program in clinical psychology. Under his leadership  the Psychological Clinic  in which the clinical program was based  was renamed the Center for Research in Personality to reflect the wider scope of his and his students’ interests and activities. McClelland served as chair of the Department of Social Relations between 1962 and 1967. After assuming emeritus status at Harvard in 1987  he became distinguished research professor at Boston University.Over the course of his long career  McClelland wrote or edited 16 books and over 185 papers or chapters. Perhaps his most widely cited work is his 1961 book  The Achieving Society  in which he analyzed the role of achievement motivation and other psychological factors in economic development. In keeping with his desire to apply psychology to the resolution of real-world problems  he developed training courses in India designed to increase the achievement motive as a way of fostering economic development.McClelland’s extensive travels often generated new research interests and theoretical perspectives. His frequent trips to India  beginning with his achievement training program there in the early 1960s  led to a deep curiosity about Eastern thought and meditation practices  which he came to view as a useful supplement to Western medicine. After a sabbatical year in Tunisia  where he read the works of Ibn Khaldun (a fourteenth-century Arab historian and philosopher)  he presented a paper proposing a “Khaldun index ” based on Khaldun’s writings about the nature and functions of government  to measure governmental effectiveness.McClelland’s courses were unusually popular. One of us (D.W.) recalls McClelland’s first lecture in a course in human motivation  in which he provided an alternative to one of Freud’s interpretations  quoted from the Hindu sacred text  Bhagavad Gita  and Plato’s Republic  discussed a German philosopher’s distinction among knowledge  desire  and action  and outlined an analysis of the biblical story of Jonah and the whale.Throughout his adult years  David was involved in the religious Society of Friends as an active member of the Cambridge Friends Meeting and a board member of the Cambridge Friends School. He honored his Quaker principles in interactions with students and colleagues  often providing psychological support for students and on occasion  financial help. One former student remembers sharing an elevator ride with McClelland from his office on the top floor of William James Hall to the Kirkland Street level. Upon hearing of the student’s financial difficulties  he asked how much money it would take to keep the student in school. McClelland then opened his checkbook and before the elevator reached the first floor had written a personal check for the amount needed.McClelland received many professional honors during his 81 years: the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association  the Bruno Klopfer Award from the Society for Personality Assessment  the Henry Murray Award from Division 8 of the American Psychological Association  the Baldwin Medal from Wesleyan  and the Wilbur Cross Medal from Yale  as well as honorary degrees from several colleges and universities.McClelland’s first wife  Mary (Sharpless) McClelland  an accomplished artist  died in 1980. David McClelland died in 1998 and is survived by his second wife  Marian  seven children  and nine grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Jerome Kagan  ChairHerbert KelmanEllen LangerDavid G.

HMS field station founder Elizabeth Lindemann dies,Elizabeth Brainerd Lindemann  a staff member of the Wellesley Human Relations Service  a field station of the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Department of Psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)  from 1948 until 1965  died July 20 at Kendall at Hanover  a Quaker-sponsored continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 94 years old.Lindemann was born in Montreal and later settled with her parents and two brothers in Dover  Mass. She attended Wellesley College and Simmons College School of Social Work. While on a student field placement at MGH  she met Erich Lindemann  the pioneering MGH and HMS psychiatrist. The couple married in 1939  drawn by their common Quaker beliefs and concern for the welfare of the community.She helped establish  along with her husband  the Human Relations Service of Wellesley  the first community mental health center in the United States. There she was chief mental health consultant  consulted to the Wellesley Public Schools  and helped train social workers  psychologists  and psychiatrists in the new field of community mental health. Later she served on and chaired the center’s board of directors. From 1959 to 1965 she worked for the Dorchester program of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.After retiring  the couple moved to Palo Alto  Calif.  where Erich Lindemann was visiting professor in the Stanford Medical Center’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Elizabeth served as a consultant to area community agencies.She edited a collection of Erich Lindemann’s unpublished papers. She also wrote the only existing biography of her husband  “Erich Lindemann: A Biographical Sketch.”Memorial gifts may be sent to the Human Relations Service  Inc.  11 Chapel Place  Wellesley  MA 02481.
James Harriman Jandl,Dr. James H. Jandl died on July 17  2006 after a prolonged illness. He spent his entire career at Harvard Medical School where he became one of the world’s premier experimental hematologists. He was also a highly effective teacher and a renowned textbooks author.Dr. Jandl was born in Racine  Wisconsin  in 1925. He enjoyed a happy and active childhood. With the encouragement of devoted parents  he developed a wide range of interests: academic  athletic  and artistic. Jandl was valedictorian of his high school class and editor-in-chief of his school newspaper  an early indication of his passion for writing. He played varsity football and basketball  and was an avid and highly skilled skier. In his teenage years he developed an interest in music and became sufficiently adept at the clarinet to play both in the high school band as well as in dance bands and jazz groups. Jandl was also a keen outdoorsman who  from his youth on  had an enormous affinity for nature  especially ornithology  which became a lifelong avocation.Jandl came of age during World War II and joined the Navy immediately following high school graduation. He was posted to a naval installation at Franklin and Marshall College where he completed his bachelor’s degree and received a B.S. in Chemistry after only two years of study. During that time  his Naval SAT scores were the highest in the U.S. His participation in college athletics included a basketball game with an Army team that consisted of the Harlem Globe Trotters!Jandl’s academic performance at Franklin and Marshall was so outstanding that he became the first student in many years from that college to attend Harvard Medical School. He received his M.D. degree from HMS in 1949  Cum Laude and a member of Alpha Omega Alpha. During his two years as intern and assistant resident on the II and IV (Harvard) Medical Services at Boston City Hospital he came under the aegis of Dr. William Castle  the George Minot Professor of Medicine. Castle served as his mentor for the next two decades  playing a critical role in developing Jandl’s interest in experimental hematology. After two years completing his tour of duty in the Navy  Jandl returned to the Thorndike Laboratory at Boston City Hospital  first as a research fellow in 1952  then Instructor in 1955  and was appointed Assistant Professor in 1959.Jandl’s research productivity was extraordinary. He took full advantage of the wealth of pathology at the Boston City Hospital and focused on inherited and acquired disorders of the red blood cell. He began studying patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and published definitive studies on red cell production and survival in chronic liver disease as well as the impact of cirrhosis on folic acid metabolism. Thirteen years later  he and Richard Cooper showed that in liver disease  the red cell membrane acquires excess phospholipids and cholesterol  leading to the formation of target-like and spiculated red cellsJandl soon turned his attention to hemolytic anemias. In a remarkably thorough and inventive series of studies published primarily in the Journal of Clinical Investigation  Jandl explored the mechanism by which antibody-coated red cells are destroyed in the liver and spleen. He exploited the use of radio-labeled erythrocytes to monitor cell survival and to identify sites of organ sequestration. Subsequently  he and his colleagues demonstrated that antibody-coated red cells attach to macrophages via the immunoglobulin FC receptor  forming flower-like rosettes. The macrophage nibbles at the membrane of adherent red cells  transforming normal biconcave discs into spherocytes. This vivid morphologic observation provided an elegant explanation for the enhanced rigidity of antibody-coated red cells which contributes importantly to their destruction. In addition  Jandl and his colleagues published definitive studies delineating the fate of free hemoglobin in the plasma  identifying organs of uptake and the process by which the kidney handles hemoglobin.Jandl made equally important contributions in other types of hemolytic anemia. He and Harry Jacob showed increased cation leak and consequent high glucose consumption in red cells of patients with hereditary spherocytosis  providing a logical explanation for their demise in the unfriendly nutrient-depleted cords of the spleen. Jandl and Jacob also broadened our understanding of the nature of drug-induced oxidant hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Their experiments provided new insights into how oxidant stress can lead to denaturation of hemoglobin within the red cell resulting in development of rigid inclusion-laden red cells. Jandl’s studies of red cell metabolism produced a coherent understanding of mechanism by which deficiency in specific red cell enzymes including pyruvate kinase leads to a shortening of red cell lifespan.Jandl’s remarkably insightful and comprehensive studies of the hemolytic anemias were accompanied  and perhaps trumped  by an equally thorough and groundbreaking investigation of the utilization of iron by erythroid cells. He and Jay Katz provided the first comprehensive understanding of the entry of iron into erythroid through iron transferrin and its binding to specific receptors. They developed the concept of the “iron transferin cycle”  a process by which this iron-binding protein in the plasma efficiently transports a large amount of iron to the erythropoietic cells in the bone marrow sufficient to accommodate high level hemoglobin production. These studies were among the very first to recognize the critical importance of receptors for specific biological transport functions.Although the great bulk of his research effort was devoted to studies of the red blood cell  Jandl collaborated with Richard Aster in comprehensive studies that provided new and fundamental insights into the nature of platelet production  lifespan and sequestration in the spleen.Jandl’s conduct of science set a standard that informed and inspired a generation of trainees who had the good fortune of working with him. His intellect was as deep as it was broad. He had uncanny insights into underlying biological mechanisms and  by a combination of reasoning and instinct  could design the experiment most apt to produce a conclusive result. His trainees learned that scientific truth is a very stern mistress  and that any presumption of discovery must pass the muster of rigorous self-criticism. Jandl conveyed a reverence for the English language  not only in his scholarly writing but also in his lectures and even in informal discussion. His remarkable effectiveness as a mentor came from a synergistic blend of these highly disciplined attributes with great personal magnetism: a delightfully wry sense of humor  a high level of energy and genuine concern for the welfare of his fellows  residents and students.In 1968 Jandl succeeded Dr. Maxwell Finland as George Richard Minot Professor and Director of the Thorndike Laboratory and Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital. Although this recognition was largely based on outstanding scientific achievements  he had become increasingly involved in teaching and administration. He earned plaudits from second year medical students for his dynamic leadership of their course in hematology pathophysiology. Third and fourth year students and residents were equally appreciative of his bedside teaching on the wards at Boston City Hospital. Jandl directed the Hematology Division at the Thorndike very effectively  maintaining high levels of productivity and esprit de corps. However  when he assumed leadership of the entire department  he encountered formidable financial and political problems that led to his stepping down after only a three-year tenure. He was succeeded by Dr. Franklin Epstein.Jandl devoted the remainder of his career writing three outstanding and widely read text books devoted to blood disorders. His Blood: Atlas and Sourcebook of Hematology  done in collaboration with his long-time associate Carola Kapff  remains the most thorough and instructive compilation of peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology. His concise single-author text Blood: Pathophysiology has given a generation of medical students an understanding of the mechanisms underlying hematologic disorders. His Blood: Textbook of Hematology is a large (1200 pages) comprehensive and scholarly compendium of the entire field  appearing in two editions  1987 and 1996. For a single author to write authoritatively on such a broad  complex and rapidly growing discipline is an exceptional tour-de-force. The writing within this tome is unfailingly precise as well as adroit  colorful  and at times witty. Understandably  this book won two national awards.Until his final illness  Jandl greatly enjoyed his retirement  having time to return to some of his boyhood passions. He and his wife Nancy took great pleasure in creatively renovating their home in Concord and cultivating their lawn and gardens. Jandl greatly enjoyed watercolor painting of outdoor landscapes. He returned to Dixieland/Big Band jazz  playing the clarinet and saxophone each summer in camps for devoted amateurs. He remained in close contact with his five children and 16 grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Howard F. Bunn  ChairRonald A. ArkyFranklin H. EpsteinDavid G. Nathan
Hay  HMS embryologist  dies at 80,Elizabeth Dexter Hay  embryologist and educator at Harvard Medical School (HMS)  died this past Aug. 20. She was 80 years old.Hay attended Smith College and received her M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1952. She was one of only four women in the class. A pioneer in the use of the electron microscope — a new tool in cell biology research — Hay became a renowned expert in the developing field of cell biology.Beginning first at Johns Hopkins  then at Cornell Medical School  and finally at HMS  Hay concentrated on cell proliferation and migration. This work led to her greatest scientific contribution: understanding the extracellular matrix (ECM)  a complex structure that surrounds and supports the cell and is often referred to as connective tissue. Hay was the first to show that the ECM plays a vital role in determining cell behaviors  including cell shape  cell-to-cell signaling  wound repair  cell adhesion  and tissue function. Most recently  she elucidated many of the mechanisms involved in the transformation of cells from more primitive to advanced forms  coining the term “epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation.”Hay was named the Louise Foote Pfeiffer Professor of Embryology at HMS in 1969. As chair of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology  she was the first woman to head a preclinical department at the School. Additionally  she was the first woman elected president of the American Society of Cell Biology and the Society for Developmental Biology. She was also the first female to receive the Conklin Medal in Developmental Biology and the second woman president of the American Association of Anatomists.HMS and Hay’s family will host a memorial service in her honor on Nov. 17. In lieu of flowers  please send donations marked “In memory of Elizabeth D. Hay” to March of Dimes  Attention: Kyra Minihane  114 Turnpike Road  Suite 202  Westboro  MA 01581  for research in craniofacial development and birth defects.
Oberhuber  curator and professor  dies  72,Konrad Oberhuber  curator of drawings and professor of fine arts from 1975 to 1987  died of brain cancer on Sept. 12 in San Diego. He was 72 years old.Born in Linz  Austria  he studied at the University of Vienna  and worked for a decade at the Albertina  the renowned Viennese museum. Before coming to Harvard he served as curator at the National Gallery of Art. When he left Cambridge in 1987  it was to return to the Albertina as its director  a post he held until his retirement in 2000.As an art historian  Oberhuber was best known as the world’s pre-eminent authority on the drawings of Raphael  but his expertise extended beyond the Italian Renaissance in many directions and across five centuries. In every European and American museum collection he visited  he correctly attributed unidentified and misidentified drawings by French  Netherlandish  Italian  and German draftsmen.An engaging and charismatic teacher and speaker  Oberhuber was the worthy successor of Paul J. Sachs and Agnes Mongan as a Harvard-based advocate for the study of drawings at the Fogg Art Museum. “For me  and for countless other students  curators  and collectors locally and across the United States  his radiant enthusiasm  combined with an extraordinary eye and superb scholarship  was a magnet to the world of works on paper. The multitude of devoted students he leaves behind — they include senior curators at the Uffizi  the Art Institute of Chicago  the National Gallery  the Morgan Library  Princeton  and the Museum of Fine Arts  Montreal — testifies to his personal warmth as well as to his effectiveness as a teacher and mentor ” said William Robinson  current Maida and George Abrams Curator of Drawings at the Fogg Art Museum.As the most prominent expert in the United States on Renaissance drawings  during the 1970s and 1980s Oberhuber was inundated with requests for help from students  scholars  collectors  dealers  and auction houses. Not only did he nurture Harvard undergraduates and graduate students  but he also served formally and informally as surrogate adviser to Ph.D. candidates from other institutions. Nearly every year he took groups of students to New York and other cities to see exhibitions and visit galleries and private collections  and he excelled at staging “teaching moments” at every stop. Ambitious collectors of drawings  including Ian Woodner  John Gaines  and John and Alice Steiner  regularly sought his advice on their acquisitions; players in the art trade called and visited him constantly. In many of his professional relationships  Oberhuber suffered fools and sharks gladly  and he never complained if they disappointed his expectations. This made him appear naive  but he acted selflessly out of genuine compassion  an irrepressible love of teaching  and to promote the interests of the Harvard University Art Museums (HUAM).Apart from his teaching  Oberhuber had an enduring impact on the HUAM. His contacts in the art trade and with collectors contributed to his success in strengthening the Drawing Department’s holdings. Important works by Titian  Federigo Barocci  Nicolas Poussin  and Thomas Eakins entered the collection because he freely shared his expertise with the dealers who found them or the collectors who bought them. Trained as a curator in one of Europe’s greatest public collections  Oberhuber brought to the department’s acquisition goals a new ambition and breadth informed by his prior experience. He took the HUAM’s holdings in new directions with the addition of German 19th century drawings  the foundation of a strong representation of the French 17th century school  and the purchase of works by contemporary European artists  such as Anselm Kiefer  Georg Baselitz  and Enzo Cucchi.“In person  Konrad was endearingly eccentric  with one foot in the past and the other in the future. His background  education  and some of his values were traditional Central European. On the other hand  with his health-food/vegetarian diet (not as common then as now)  casual outfits  adherence to Rudolf Steiner’s anthroposophy  and freedom from many conventional inhibitions  he embodied New Age before ‘New Age’ arrived ” said Robinson.
GSD professor  renowned engineer  LeMessurier dead at 81,William James LeMessurier  Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) adjunct professor of architectural technology in the Department of Architecture  died this past July 14. One of the world’s pre-eminent structural engineers  he taught at the GSD for decades. He was 81.Born in Pontiac  Mich.  LeMessurier graduated with an A.B. from Harvard  and then attended the GSD before earning a master’s degree from MIT in 1953. Founder and chairman of LeMessurier Consultants  he was awarded the American Institute of Architects’ (AIA) Allied Professions Medal in 1968  elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978  and elected an honorary member of both the AIA (1988) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (1989).LeMessurier was responsible for the structural engineering on many prominent buildings  including Boston City Hall  Boston’s State Street Bank  Boston’s Federal Reserve Bank  the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport  and the National Air and Space Museum. LeMessurier is perhaps best known for his work on the Citicorp headquarters tower in New York City in 1977. As the result of the questions of a student  LeMessurier reassessed his work after the building had already been finished and found that it was more vulnerable than originally thought. This triggered a retrofit described in a celebrated article in The New Yorker  “The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis.”LeMessurier developed new structural systems  including the Mah-LeMessurier System for pre-cast concrete in high-rise housing  the Staggered Truss System for high-rise steel structures  and the Tuned Mass Damper used to reduce tall building motion.A tribute and reception in celebration of his teaching and work will be held Oct. 10 at the GSD.

Former staff  prestigious artist Crite dies at 97,Allan Rohan Crite  a renowned painter and Harvard Extension School alumnus  passed away on Sept. 6. He was 97.Famous for his depictions of black community life in Boston  Crite  whose work has appeared in museums throughout the country  earned his A.B.E. in 1968. He also worked part time at the Extension School’s Grossman Library from 1974 until 1989 and received the 350th Harvard University Anniversary Medal in 1986.That same year  the Extension School and the Harvard Extension Alumni Association established the Annamae and Allan R. Crite Prize in honor of Crite and his mother  Annamae  who regularly attended courses for more than 50 years and encouraged her son to pursue studies at the Extension School. Crite Prizes are awarded to Extension School degree recipients who demonstrate “singular dedication to learning and the arts.”
Elkan R. Blout,In the world of scientific research and development  few investigators could be considered “renaissance” persons  capable of seemingly integrating the various realms of this world – – industry  academe  government and public service. Elkan Blout was such a renaissance person. His research interests spanned chemistry  protein science and medicine. He was a prolific inventor at Polaroid  a wise manager  and leader of colleagues both in industry and in the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. He was a creative and influential advisor to the FDA  to the NAS  and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Most of all  he was a devoted teacher and mentor  whose commitment  warmth and enthusiasm to his students and trainees was the foundation for his resolve to offer elegant clarity in communicating complex formulations.Elkan was born in New York City on July 2nd 1919 and was the only child in his family. Precocity was evident in his progress through school as he skipped grades and graduated from high school just before turning 15. Elkan spent a postgraduate year at Phillips Exeter Academy and then enrolled at Princeton. After a brief foray in chemical engineering  he majored in Chemistry  graduating in 1939. He enrolled in the chemistry department at Columbia for graduate studies and completed the PhD in 1942 at the still tender age of 23. A year spent at the Harvard Chemistry Department as a postdoctoral fellow with Profs Louis Fieser and Robert Woodward proved highly consequential. Woodward introduced Blout to Edwin Land at Polaroid who talked Elkan into foregoing employment at a pharmaceutical company to take a chance at doing something “practical” at Polaroid.For 19 years  from 1943-1962  Elkan flourished in collaboration with Land  contributing significantly to development of the instant photographic process and color film development. At Polaroid  Elkan was an inventor of dozens of patents. Getting to work intimately with Edwin Land  one of the great American industrial innovators of the twentieth century  gave Elkan a unique perspective on discovery and development in research. The financial success of Polaroid in those two decades also gave Elkan the opportunity to become expert in finance and investing  a skill he would put to use as treasurer of the National Academy of Sciences in the 1980s and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the 1990s.While engaged at Polaroid with a full plate of scientific and managerial responsibilities  from 1950 onwards Elkan established a spectroscopy laboratory at Children’s hospital to study biophysics of peptides and proteins. He was a research associate in pathology starting in 1950  became a lecturer in biophysics in 1960-1962  and accepted a Professorship in the Department of Biological Chemistry at HMS in 1962  leaving Polaroid after almost two decades.Elkan’s move to HMS reinforced the strong tradition of protein chemistry in the HMS Department of Biological Chemistry from the days of EJ Cohn and the Laboratory of Protein Structure that had worked out blood fractionation and serum albumen purification. After Cohn died and his successor L. Oncley was recruited to Michigan in 1962  it was clear that Elkan would be a superb appointment given his expertise in physical biochemistry and spectroscopic characterization of proteins and peptides by optical rotary dispersion methods.Typically  Elkan’s combination of energy  wisdom  and respect for his colleagues led him to great success as a full-time academic. In 1964  he became the Edward Harkness Professor and held that chair until his retirement in 1990. He became department chair in 1965  only two years after his arrival  and was an effective recruiter  persuading one of us (CCR) to join the department in favor of other alternatives .Once at HMS  Elkan brought all the warmth of his personality  his intellectual breadth  his capacity for organization  and his love of learning to his teaching and interaction with students. Before the institution of the “New Pathway”  Elkan was the course director of the “Honors” biochemistry course offered to those HMS students and GSAS (graduate) students that had already taken biochemistry in college. Elkan conceived that course and carefully marshaled its content. It was a “topics course”  delving into great detail on aspects of biochemistry – at the forefront of the field – that most (if not all) students had not been exposed to previously. The course provided education on the structural biology of protein (using collagen as an example – taught by Paul Gallop)  on aspects of glycobiology (taught by Robert Spiro)  on nucleic acid structure and biosynthesis (taught by Roger D. Kornberg) and on principles and application of mass spectrometry and protein crystallography (taught by Elkan). This was a truly “All Star” cast of leading researchers and educators  handpicked by Elkan to inspire students to view biochemistry as an evolving science  not merely a string of metabolic pathways.Elkan attended all lectures and discussions and was consistently meticulously dressed  typically in a pressed suit of highest quality  leading most students to admire his sense of style. However  Elkan held no pretense with any student and quickly knew all students by first name. More importantly  Elkan treated each student with great personal warmth and dignity. He would greet students enthusiastically as he walked through the Quadrangle  stopping to answer any question at any time. Every student felt his special devotion to their education and well-being. Elkan’s consistently gentle and patient demeanor in expressing the most difficult of formulations inspired a generation of followers  in turn bringing forth scientists willing to tackle the most challenging problems and teachers who sought only to communicate effectively. These were his most treasured gifts to his students.His scientific investigations into peptide structure and conformation  including of cyclic peptides were properly perceived as ground breaking by the biochemistry and biophysics scholarly communities. Indicative of his stature in the field of biopolymers  Elkan was a founding editor of the journal Biopolymers. His scientific achievements won him election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1969 and the Institute of Medicine in 1979. He was subsequently honored for lifetime achievement in peptide chemistry by the Ralph Hirchmann award from the American Chemical Society in 1991. But the epitome of Elkan’s recognition for contributions to the broad sweep of chemical and life sciences came with the award of the National Medal of Science in 1990.As testimony to his wisdom and insight into both the management and execution of Science  Elkan agreed to assume the responsibility of Dean for academic affairs at the Harvard School of Public Health from 1978-1989  even serving as Chair of the Department of Environmental Science and Physiology from 1986-1988. Among his innovations was the establishment of the division of biological sciences at HSPH. As an indication of the unusual esteem for this wise colleague at both schools  friends joined with Elkan to create Elkan Blout professorships at both HMS and HSPH on the occasion of his move to emeritus status in 1990.In all of his interactions across the many arenas and constituencies of his life  Elkan approached opportunities and challenges with a balance and open nature which endeared him to friends and made him a much sought after advisor. In strategic thinking Elkan not only thought out of the box  but seemed to operate easily in multidimensional space. In twentieth century sports metaphors  one talked of rare and perhaps mythical athletes who were triple threats. Elkan Blout was such a paragon  standing out in the industrial sphere  the academic sphere  and the public service sphere. Beyond all this  Elkan’s judgment on scientific opportunities and on financial matters was legendary. The former skill set led the FDA to appoint him as senior scientific advisor for the period 1991-1998. For the latter knowledge Elkan was a much beloved treasurer of the NAS endowment  overseeing a 5-fold increase in assets during his 12 years (1980-1992) as treasurer.Elkan had many interests to complement his love of science  his capacity for invention  and his financial acumen on behalf of nonprofits. Among them were a love for fishing and an appreciation for the intricacies of the poker table. But the center of Elkan’s universe was his wife  Gail  his constant source of love and companionship. Gail’s support enabled Elkan to succeed in so many professional endeavors. He was deeply devoted to her and to his four children  James  Susan Merry Lausch  William and Darya. He died in December 2006.Respectfully submitted Christopher T Walsh  chairpersonEugene P. KennedyCharles C. RichardsonRobert Sackstein

Mendelson  substance abuse research pioneer  77,Jack H. Mendelson  director of McLean Hospital’s Clinical Research Program on Substance Abuse  co-director of its Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center (ADARC)  and professor of psychiatry (neuroscience) at Harvard Medical School (HMS)  passed away on Aug. 15 after a brief illness. He was 77.A dedicated and well-respected researcher and mentor  Mendelson  along with his wife Nancy K. Mello  founded the ADARC at McLean Hospital nearly 35 years ago.“Jack was a pioneer in the investigation of the biological and behavioral aspects of substance abuse and was among the first to bring multidisciplinary collaboration of modern technology and organized research administration to this field of study ” said Scott L. Rauch  president and psychiatrist in chief for McLean Hospital  the largest psychiatric affiliate of Harvard Medical School. “His findings not only revolutionized scientific understanding of substance use behavior  it stimulated a new generation of behavioral and psychosocial researchers.”Mendelson authored more than 480 original peer-reviewed articles in numerous biomedical journals  including Science  Nature  the New England Journal of Medicine  the American Journal of Psychiatry  Biological Psychiatry  and the Journal of the American Medical Association. His influence on the field of substance abuse research was recognized earlier this summer  when the College on Problems of Drug Dependence honored Mendelson and Mello with the Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award for their innovative advances in the field of drug addiction research and treatment.Born in Baltimore  Mendelson earned a bachelor’s degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1951 and a medical degree from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1955. Following medical school  he completed his internship at Boston City Hospital (BCH) and his psychiatry residency training at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1966  he became the first chief of the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Alcoholism  a division of the National Institutes of Health. In 1970  he was named chief of the BCH Psychiatry Department. Three years later  McLean Hospital recruited him to spearhead its alcohol and drug abuse research program — a program that has burgeoned under his and Mello’s leadership  and is characterized by knowledge  hard work  and scientific savvy. In its 34 years  the ADARC’s multidisciplinary research programs have expanded exponentially. The center now includes four laboratory divisions  which  since their founding  have been continuously funded by competitively obtained  peer-reviewed  federal grants and contracts.A widely recognized authority and contributor to the science of addiction  Mendelson was often sought by key policymakers in Washington  D.C. He served as a consultant to the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention  overseen by the Executive Office of the President; the President’s Biomedical Research Panel; and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. He was a member of the nominating committee for the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine since 1982.Mendelson’s awards include the Journal of Nuclear Medicine Award of Merit; the Distinguished Research Award from the Research Society on Alcoholism; the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry Founders Award; and the Hofheimer Prize from the American Psychiatric Association for Research in Alcoholism. In 2003  he became a distinguished life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.He was the associate editor for Psychosomatic Medicine and was regional editor for Pharmacology  Biochemistry & Behavior. From 1984 until 1991  he was co-editor of the Journal of Studies on Alcohol.“Dr. Mendelson’s personal and scientific contributions to the field of substance abuse research and treatment  coupled with his devotion to mentoring young investigators  will serve as a lasting legacy to McLean and to the broader scientific community ” said Rauch.He leaves his wife of 33 years  Nancy K. Mello; two sons  John E. Mendelson and Adam Mendelson; a daughter  Ellen Mendelson Maher; and four grandchildren.

Noted Islamic scholar Mahdi dies at 81,Muhsin S. Mahdi  the James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic Emeritus  died July 9 after a long series of illnesses. He was 81.Mahdi  considered by many to be the world’s foremost scholar of medieval Arabic and Islamic political philosophy  taught at Harvard from 1969 until his retirement in 1996. He served as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies from 1970 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1981  and as chair of the department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from 1981 to 1984.“Muhsin was a brilliant scholar  convivial and collegial mentor  thoughtful and gracious friend  and serene and patient but unsentimental observer of the human condition ” said William Graham  the Murray A. Albertson Professor of Middle Eastern Studies and dean of the Faculty of Divinity.“I had the privilege of studying with him  working with him as a departmental colleague  and enjoying his support and friendship over some four decades from his arrival at Harvard until his death last month. His scholarship will stand as a lasting contribution to our understanding of European-Mediterranean thought and literature in the era of the Western Middle Ages  especially its Arabic manifestations in philosophy and literature.”Born in 1926 in the Shiite pilgrimage city of Karbala  Iraq  Mahdi completed his primary and secondary schooling there and in Baghdad  then earned degrees in business administration and philosophy from the American University in Beirut  Lebanon  in 1947.He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1954  where he studied with Islamic scholar Nabia Abbott and political philosopher Leo Strauss. Mahdi’s dissertation on the 14th century Arabic historian and social scientist Ibn Khaldun was quickly recognized as a path-breaking study. It was published in 1957 as “Ibn Khaldun’s Philosophy of History: A Study in the Philosophical Foundation of the Science of Culture.” Mahdi’s many published volumes also include “The Political Orientation of Islamic Philosophy” (1982)  “Alfarabi and the Foundation of Islamic Political Philosophy” (2001)  and a definitive Arabic edition of “The Thousand and One Nights” (1984).Thoroughly versed in ancient Greek and medieval Jewish and Christian philosophy  as well as in modern Western political philosophy  Mahdi sought to establish rigorous scholarly standards in the field of Arabic and Islamic studies. He was known for the discovery  translation  and editing of previously unknown manuscripts  including many by the Persian philosopher and scientist Alfarabi (872-950).Remembered as an influential teacher who inspired great loyalty from his students  Mahdi designed and taught the Core course “Foreign Cultures 14 ” an introduction to the economic  social  and cultural background of the Middle East.Before coming to Harvard  Mahdi taught in the University of Chicago’s department of Oriental Languages and Civilizations from 1957 to 1969. He was a visiting professor or lecturer at the American University in Cairo; the University of California  Los Angeles; the University of Freiburg; the Central Institute of Islamic Research in Karachi  Pakistan; and the University of Baghdad.He was president of the American Association of Teachers of Arabic  the American Research Center in Egypt  the International Society for the History of Arabic and Islamic Sciences and Philosophy  and the Society for the Study of Islamic Philosophy and Science  as well as a member of many other learned societies.Mahdi is survived by his wife  Sarah Roche-Mahdi; two daughters  Fatima and Nadia  from a previous marriage to Cynthia Risner; and two stepdaughters  Rachel and Rebekah Gerstein. He is also survived by his first wife  Louise Carus Mahdi.
Alexander H. Leighton of School of Public Health dies at 99,Professor Alexander H. Leighton  first chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences (now part of the Department of Society  Human Development  and Health) at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH)  passed away on Aug. 11 at his home in Nova Scotia  Canada. He was 99.Leighton was the husband of Jane Murphy  a professor in HSPH’s Department of Epidemiology. In an e-mail to the HSPH community  Dean for Academic Affairs James Ware described Leighton as an important contributor to the School’s psychiatric epidemiology program.Born in Philadelphia  Leighton graduated from Princeton University in 1932 before earning a master’s degree in physiology from Cambridge University in 1934. Two years later  he earned an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University. In 1966  Harvard University awarded him an honorary degree.Leighton served during World War II and then embarked on a nearly 20-year career at Cornell University. There  he became a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Cornell Medical College and in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. While at Cornell in 1948  Leighton launched the landmark Stirling County Study in a Canadian study population. This undertaking was a longitudinal study of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders  and comparative studies were conducted in New York City  Alaska  Nigeria  and Vietnam.Leighton joined the HSPH faculty in 1966 as a professor of social psychiatry. While chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences  he gathered specialists in medicine  sociology  anthropology  and psychology to study the mental health of populations  identify social and cultural factors that influence mental illness  and explore rehabilitative and preventive measures on a population basis.In 1975  Leighton retired from the School  at which time his wife  Jane  assumed responsibility for the Stirling County Study. Leighton received a National Health Scientist Award from the Government of Canada and was appointed professor of psychiatry and professor of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax  Nova Scotia.Leighton is survived by his wife  Jane; a daughter  Doreen Leighton Walker of California; a son  Ted Leighton of Saskatoon  Saskatchewan; and five grandchildren. A memorial service was held in Nova Scotia. A service in Boston will be held at a later date. More information about this service will be announced when it becomes available.
Harvard College Fund’s ‘Peabo’ Gardner dies,On Sept. 5  Harvard and the Harvard College Fund lost one of its best-known loyalists. George Peabody Gardner III  known to colleagues and friends everywhere as “Peabo ” succumbed to cancer after a lengthy and courageous battle.Gardner came from a Boston family whose connections to the University go back generations. As director of leadership giving for the Harvard College Fund for the last several years  he brought that long history of associations to his job  along with high energy and a selfless dedication to raising funds for the institution he cared so much about.He was born in Boston on March 12  1948  to George and Tatiana Gardner. After attending Saint Mark’s School in Southborough  Mass.  he entered Harvard  graduating cum laude in 1970. A member of Naval ROTC at college  Gardner served as a junior grade in the Naval Supply Corps from the time of his graduation until 1973. He had married Susan Paul just before starting his senior year. Their son  Augustus  was born shortly after Gardner left the service  and their daughter  Hilary  was born four years later.Always interested in art  Gardner worked for Sotheby’s in New York between 1973 and 1975 in the American Decorative Arts and Paintings Department. He stayed in New York for another year  at William Beadleston Inc.  a gallery specializing in 19th and 20th century painting  sculpture  and drawings.Gardner received an M.B.A. from Babson College in 1979. Immediately after that  he began to work in nonprofit fundraising  first as manager of the development office at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA)  then as assistant to the director of the museum for five years  and finally as director of development  from 1985 to 1989.Gardner had also been involved with the Boston auction house of Grogan & Company  and in 1989  he left the MFA to devote more time to that enterprise  of which he remained a director until his death. In 1990  he began work at Harvard as director of the Associates Program of the Harvard College Fund. His career involved extensive travel and meetings with alumni  and later  as director of Leadership Giving  the mentoring of many officers working with Harvard Class Reunions. He was a kind  generous colleague  respected for his modesty and impeccable courtesy to all. One of those with whom he had worked for many years said simply  “He was one of the finest men I have ever known.”Motivated by a strong belief in the importance of giving back to those institutions that were personally important to him  Gardner served as a trustee of the Dexter School  president of the St. Mark’s School Alumni Association  overseer of the Children’s Hospital Medical Center  trustee of the Art Conservation Resource Center  trustee of St. Mark’s School  and member of the Corporation of Babson College. He was also an active trustee of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.Gardner leaves his wife of 38 years  Susan  his son  Gus (A.B. ’94)  daughter  Hilary  and four grandchildren. He is also survived by his parents  George P. Gardner ’39 and Tatiana Gardner.A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Sept. 29 in the Memorial Church.

Arthur Maass,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 15  2007  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Arthur Maass  the Frank G. Thomson Professor of Government  Emeritus  was a political scientist in the grand tradition  a scholar who wanted not only to find out how the institutions of government actually work  but also what could be done to make them better serve the common good. This passion both to analyze and to reform  this two-fold institutional and normative approach  inspired the work in each of his main fields  public administration and the legislative process. His early research on the Army Corps of Engineers in time made him one of the twentieth century’s most influential authorities on the planning and development of the nation’s water resources. Later on  his pioneering study of the Congress as an organ of government by discussion again displayed an institutional and normative approach  anticipating by years the concern with “deliberative democracy” among political scientists. This fearless and penetrating mind grasped the weaknesses of our pluralistic democracy and its abundant promise of national achievement.Arthur Maass launched his professional career with a fierce attack that ultimately led to fundamental reforms. He had been well prepared for this venture. After taking his A.B. at Johns Hopkins in 1939 and an M.P.A. at Harvard in 1941  he spent the war years and immediately thereafter serving on such agencies as the Office of the Secretary of the Navy  the Natural Resources Planning Board  the Bureau of the Budget and the water resources staff of the Natural Resources Task Force of the first Hoover Commission. Returning to Harvard he won his Ph.D. in 1949. His dissertation  which examined the development of the water resources of the United States  led to his first book  Muddy Waters: The Army Engineers and the Nation’s Rivers. Published in 1951 with an explosive introduction by FDR’s feisty Secretary of the Interior  Harold L. Ickes  it became a classic of political science. It was notable not only as an exposé of cozy relationships between the private and public sectors  but also and above all as an analysis of an “iron triangle ” its dysfunctional consequences and a scheme of reform. He did not use that term  but his example served as the model for a host of succeeding studies  so named. Like Muddy Waters  breaking from the conventional focus on pressure groups simply as agents of private interests  they revealed complex networks of influence among interest groups  congressional committees and bureaucratic agencies.Although a severe critic of the iron triangle  Arthur Maass was no enemy of the bureaucratic expert. On the contrary  he brought to the study of public administration the high regard for both natural and social science common in those days of the atom bomb and Keynesian economics. He had great faith that this approach could be used to remedy the self-defeating pluralism of the iron triangles by means of a comprehensive process of planning. A framed sign in his room read  “Make no little plans; they have not the power to move men’s souls.” While Director of the Harvard Water Program in1955 to 1965  he led and edited a massive multidisciplinary effort entitled Design of Water Resource Systems: New Techniques for Relating Economic Objectives  Engineering Analysis  and Government Planning. Published in 1962  this work pioneered the use of computers to construct complex mathematical models of river systems in order to better coordinate demands for hydroelectric power  flood control  irrigation  industrial and city water supply  navigation and recreation. Many of its ideas were later incorporated in  Principles and Guidelines  the Corps’ manual of water resources management.While American problems were Arthur Maass’s main concern  he also studied similar questions in other countries. His attention being attracted by irrigation  he traveled widely in and wrote about arid regions not only in the American West  but also in Spain  Morocco and most surprisingly China at a time when the Chinese were severely restricting contacts with foreigners. He devised an elegant methodology for characterizing and comparing irrigation systems  in 1978 publishing with R. L. Anderson  comparative study  And the Deserts Shall Rejoice: Conflict Growth and Justice in Arid Environments. Interspersed with his books he also published a number of substantial articles and monographs on this and other relevant topics.The culminating recognition of Arthur’s mastery of water resources management came on April 6  2001. That day half a century after the publication of Muddy Waters the Army Corps of Engineers honored him for his severe  but instructive critique over the years. At a ceremony in its research headquarters  the Corps with a great array of brass on hand accepted the personal libraries of research materials donated by Dr. Arthur Maass and Dr. Gilbert White  another pioneer in the field  as a reference room named after the two scholars.In his last major work  Congress and the Common Good (1983)  Arthur shifted his focus from the executive to the legislative branch  although  philosophically speaking  as in his earlier work the underlying problem was still how to make the Many into One. Rejecting the widely held view that the democratic process  electoral  legislative and executive  reaches decisions by bargaining and log-rolling among fixed interests  he argued that discussion on the basis of shared values makes a further and decisive contribution by transforming such preferences. In this deliberative model  the achievement is not merely to reflect what is brought to the process  but rather to discover something by means of the process. In exact  detailed analysis of the relation of Congress as a whole to its committees and to the Presidency  he showed how this function was performed. His leadership in this field did a great deal to offset the influence of positivist and behavioral viewpoints. Moreover  his unparalleled knowledge was recognized not only by colleagues  but also by the Congress itself. He was asked to testify on even such intimate matters as reform of the rules.Throughout his career Arthur’s merits and achievements were abundantly recognized. Joining the Department of Government in 1948  he was made an assistant professor in 1949  received tenure in 1954  became a full professor in 1959  chaired the department from 1963 to 1967  in which year he was appointed to the Thomson professorship  and retired to emeritus status in 1984. He enjoyed other governmental and academic appointments in addition to those mentioned above in the United States  China  Spain  Puerto Rico and Mexico.Arthur Maass was not only an eminent scholar  but also a devoted  effective and popular teacher. He offered his specialized lecture courses and seminars and also the big undergraduate course on American Government  a “must” for concentrators. A tutor in Dunster House  he had a close relationship with its undergraduates  a warm friend but also a stern task master  enforcing the wearing of coats and ties and other antique customs then practiced in Cambridge. His care and affection were illustrated by his bequest of a substantial sum to finance free Boston Symphony tickets for Harvard undergraduates.On retirement he moved from Dunster House to a penthouse high above Boston Harbor where he became well known as “il professore” in the Italo-American community. There he died of kidney failure on March 26  2004. To the last  however  he kept his office at Littauer  maintaining a lively contact with the governmental world. His affection for the undergraduates did not diminish  but during the disorders brought on by the Vietnam War  he took a strong line against the radicals and their faculty allies  displaying rare talents as a political manager. In these years his political opinions having swung unmistakably from liberal to conservative  the sign advising “no little plans” was missing. Still he retained on his office wall from his New Deal days a framed front page of the Chicago Tribune for November 3  1948  declaring  “DEWEY BEATS TRUMAN.”Respectfully submitted Harvey C.

James Robert Hightower,Faculty of Arts and Sciences—Memorial MinuteAt a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences May 1  2007  the following Minute was placed upon the records.James Robert Hightower  Victor S. Thomas Professor of Chinese Literature  Emeritus  who died on January 8  2006  was born on May 7  1915 in Sulphur  Oklahoma but grew up in Salida  Colorado  where his father was the school superintendent. James Robert  who was known as Robert or Bob  majored in chemistry at the University of Colorado  but by the time of his graduation in 1936  he had switched his interests to literature. Together with two college friends  he won a scholarship to the University of Heidelberg. He spent the post-graduate year in Heidelberg and Paris  writing poetry and working at a novel as well as continuing the study of Chinese he had begun in the United States. In Paris he managed to meet James Joyce. (The following year he escorted another literary hero  Ezra Pound  about the Yard  only to be appalled by Pound’s anti-Semitism.)One of Robert’s friends at Heidelberg was Jean Stafford  who made her name as a novelist. Robert remained Stafford’s loyal friend and confidant during the rest of her tumultuous life. He kept copies of their correspondence  totaling 455 pieces written over 42 years  and after her death donated it to the Jean Stafford Collection at the University of Colorado at Boulder. One of Stafford’s biographers described it as “the most remarkable epistolary record” he had ever seen.1In 1937  Robert enrolled at Harvard for graduate study in Far Eastern Languages and Comparative Literature. In June 1940  with a fellowship from the Harvard-Yenching Institute  he set off for Beijing to work on his dissertation. Interned by the Japanese  he was repatriated in 1943 in an exchange of prisoners  after which he joined the U.S. Army and worked on breaking enemy codes. Returning to Harvard  he completed his Ph.D. in 1946. He was appointed Assistant Professor in 1948  Associate Professor in 1952  and Professor in 1958. From 1960 to 1964 he chaired Harvard’s Committee on East Asian Studies and from 1961 to 1965 the Far Eastern Languages Department.His dissertation  a translation and exegesis of the Han dynasty text Han shi waizhuan (1946  published in 1952)  showed his mastery of sinological method. His second work  modestly titled Topics in Chinese Literature (1950  rev. ed. 1952  1966)  in fact forms the basis for a history of Chinese literature  the first scholarly work of such a scope in a Western language. It is distinguished by its judicious choice of recommended reading in Chinese and Japanese as well as European languages  but even more by its refusal to speculate or to retail supposedly established opinion; to a remarkable degree it is the product of the author’s own reading and judgment. In this and in articles written in the 1950s  he developed an approach to Chinese literature that has been extremely influential. In the 1960s he turned to work on the poet Tao Qian (365-427); that culminated in his translation of the complete poems The Poetry of Tao Qian (1970)  a book that displays his characteristically meticulous scholarship and graceful renderings. In the 1970s he turned his attention to the ci or “song lyric” of the Song dynasty. In this he was joined by Yeh Chia-ying  professor of Chinese Literature at the National Taiwan University  a distinguished specialist in Chinese poetry. The work they did together is a rare instance of close collaboration between two senior scholars. Their articles on individual writers and distinctive styles may be said to have opened up a new field in Chinese literary studies. A number of such articles were collected and published in their Studies in Chinese Poetry (1998).In the classroom Robert was an exacting teacher  but one whom his students soon came to appreciate. As a former graduate student  Professor Ronald C. Egan writes: “One sensed that he brought to the study of Chinese poetry something of the demand for precision that he had acquired in his early training in the sciences….Page after page of recopied texts  without any Chinese notes or annotations  were distributed to students. These were accompanied by lengthy glossaries that he had compiled  giving brief English equivalents for the phrases that students were unlikely to recognize. Once the class began  students were called upon in turn to read and explicate short passages. Hightower never said anything until after the student had committed himself to an interpretation. He believed  as he sometimes observed  that ‘nothing is easier to understand than the meaning of a Chinese sentence after it has been explained to you.’” Another former student  Professor Eva Shan Chou  notes: “As an advisor  Professor Hightower had a succinct way of evaluating a proposed project that both opened up its scholarly potential and suggested its central paradox. He also had an unerring sense for false evidence and trite arguments.”Robert was a man of strong and generous sympathies  as many can testify. It was entirely characteristic of him that after his former student William T. Graham Jr. died an untimely death  Robert should devote himself to completing part of Graham’s projected study of the poet Yu Xin.At the parties for faculty and students that Robert and his wife Florence (“Bunny”) gave at their house in Auburndale  Robert was very much the genial host. He was also an active man  with a wide variety of interests. Skiing was a particular passion of his  and he and Bunny used to take their children on skiing holidays. Cycling  which he had enjoyed in Europe  was another. He began riding his bicycle from Auburndale to Cambridge and continued to do so into his eighties  to the consternation of his colleagues. Gardening  particularly of vegetables  was a late interest  but one to which  characteristically  he gave meticulous attention  even to the extent of keeping a garden log. Cooking  especially of his own produce  was another interest.Bunny died in 1981. Robert is survived by their four children  James  Samuel  Josephine Steiner-Neukirch  and Thomas; twelve grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.Respectfully submitted Edwin A. CranstonPhilip A.

Frank H. Westheimer  major figure in 20th century chemistry  dies at 95,Frank H. Westheimer  Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry Emeritus  at Harvard University and one of the key figures in 20th century chemistry  died at his home in Cambridge  Mass.  on April 14. He was 95.Westheimer was at the forefront of a major revolution in the field of chemistry involving the sophisticated integration of the fields of physical and organic chemistry and the use of this approach to determine in unprecedented detail the way in which chemical reactions take place. These fundamental advances in the theory of chemical reaction mechanisms are the bedrock of modern chemistry and the basis for much of its current success in guiding research on the creation of complex molecules and the invention of new medicines.Despite his great proficiency in mathematics and physical-organic chemistry  and the dramatic progress that he achieved in mechanistic chemistry  Westheimer turned his attention by 1950 to the study of enzyme reactions and biochemistry. Here too  his pioneering studies had a profound and lasting impact — this time on biological and biochemical processes.Over a span of four decades  Westheimer repeatedly demonstrated an ability to take up a fundamental scientific problem — one that appeared either insoluble or very difficult — and to solve it in an elegant and completely definitive way. This approach defined a unique style of research and became a recognizable personal style. He enjoyed going on to new challenges more than exploiting the large new areas that he had opened up. On the occasion of receiving the Priestly Medal  the highest recognition of the American Chemical Society  in 1988  Westheimer remarked  “Whether I would have made a larger contribution to chemistry if I had done fewer things and exploited them better  well  no one will ever know.” What is certain is that his research was deeply influential  enormously instructive to his colleagues  and empowering to their science.Another Westheimer trademark was his inexhaustible supply of wise aphorisms. For example  advice to a research student: “Why spend a day in the library when you can learn the same thing by working in the laboratory for a month?”Frank Henry Westheimer was born in Baltimore on Jan. 15  1912. He attended Dartmouth College and graduated summa cum laude in 1932. His father  a successful Baltimore stockbroker  at first questioned his decision to major in science  but became enthusiastic after talking to Dartmouth faculty. Westheimer entered the graduate program at Harvard in 1932 to study under James B. Conant. Shortly afterward  Conant assumed the presidency of Harvard and Westheimer was left without an adviser. Westheimer later recalled presenting an idea to Conant  who advised: “It may not work  but if it does  it will be a footnote to a footnote in the history of chemistry.” This casually imparted wisdom was clearly taken to heart.After receiving his doctorate at Harvard in 1935  Westheimer went to Columbia University as a National Research Fellow in the then-new field of physical-organic chemistry. He accepted a faculty position at the University of Chicago in 1936  and in 1937 married Jeanne Friedmann. During World War II  he was a supervisor at the National Explosives Research Laboratory. After the war  he resumed his post at the University of Chicago  where he remained until moving to Harvard in 1953. At Harvard  he was the Morris Loeb Professor and an admired teacher of both undergraduate and graduate students.Westheimer was the recipient of numerous honors and honorary degrees  including the U.S. National Medal of Science  the U.S. National Academy Award in Chemical Sciences  the Robert A. Welch Foundation Award in Chemistry  and many awards of the American Chemical Society. His national service extended far beyond his involvement in World War II research. He served as a science adviser to President Lyndon Johnson  and in 1966 he chaired an enormously influential Committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that set a course of action for federal support of the chemical sciences. The recommendations of that report were implemented and are still regarded as comprehensive  definitive  and forward-looking. In 2002 Harvard University established the Frank H. Westheimer Medal for scientific excellence in his honor.Westheimer and his wife had a very wide circle of friends drawn from around the world but especially from the academic and intellectual community in the Boston area. Weekend dinners at their home were filled with humor and laughter  but also with penetrating analyses and discussions of world events and problems. Westheimer’s command of national issues was extraordinary. He reasoned against war  first in Vietnam and then in Iraq. For four decades  he emphasized the need for strong measures against pollution and global warming and in favor of energy conservation  alternative energy development  and greater support of fundamental research. He encouraged fellow chemists to apply their skills to other disciplines  especially biology and medicine. He pleaded with universities to improve the education of nonscientists by finding new ways to teach science. He viewed the problem as complex  but soluble  if the verticality of scientific subjects with their numerous course prerequisites could be dealt with by a new kind of teaching for nonscientists.Westheimer was admired and respected as a person by his students and colleagues worldwide. Most would agree on the salient qualities that defined the man throughout his life: a powerful intellect  great personal integrity and courage  extraordinary dedication to scientific discovery  and a deep concern for country and humankind. He was a gregarious and social person with a happy family life. His wife of 64 years  Jeanne  passed away in 2001. He is survived by their daughters  Ruth Susan Westheimer of Worcester  Mass.  and Ellen Westheimer of Carlisle  Mass.— E.J. Corey  Deptartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology
Mason Hammond,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences March 13  2007  the following Minute was placed upon the records.Mason Hammond was born in Boston on February 14  1903  the son of Samuel Hammond  Class of 1881  and Grace Learoyd  and died in Cambridge on October 13  2002  four months short of his one hundredth birthday. Nearly all of his professional life was devoted to Harvard. Prepared at St. Mark’s School  to which he later rendered service including as chairman of the Board of Trustees  in 1921 he achieved the highest score of all those who sat for examinations for admission to the Harvard Class of 1925  and he achieved Rank List I for each of his undergraduate years. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year  graduated summa cum laude  and gave the Latin Oration at Commencement. From 1925 to 1928  he studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar where  a member of Balliol College  he earned a second B.A.  and a B.Litt.In 1928  Mason Hammond returned to Harvard  where he began his career in the Classics and History departments. From 1937 to 1939  1951 to 1952  and 1955 to 1957 he was in charge of classical studies at the American Academy in Rome  and he served two appointments as acting director of the Villa I Tatti  Harvard’s Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. In 1950 he succeeded his mentor  Arthur Stanley Pease  as Pope Professor of the Latin Language and Literature  retiring in 1973  and in the year following he served as Visiting Professor of the Classics at the University of Wisconsin. Professor Hammond enjoyed a long and fruitful retirement  during which he devoted himself to the history of his College and University. He was awarded the Harvard Medal by the Harvard Alumni Association in 1987  and in 1994 the University conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. When presenting him to the president  the University Marshal said of him  “Few of her children  Mr. President  have had as long or as loving a relationship with this University as our next honorand.”From 1946 to 1955  Professor Hammond served as master of Kirkland House  and before that as the first head tutor of Lowell House where  with Professor Julian Lowell Coolidge and President Lowell  he helped to foster the first generation of the House system. He also served for many years on the Committee on Commencement Parts  where he supervised the delivery of the Latin oration; and on the Committee on Seals  Arms  and Diplomas. On the latter committee he helped to provoke the ‘Latin Riots’ when he supported President Pusey’s view that the College diploma be printed in English  using the practical argument that most undergraduates could not read Latin.For more than fifty years  from 1936 to 1986  with exceptions for war service and leaves of absence  Hammond was Commencement caller  his Brahmin bray of a voice organizing the Commencement procession from the chaos of the Old Yard  the voice not only of Commencement but of Harvard itself. It was a source of great personal satisfaction to Hammond to have called the procession at the Tercentenary celebrations  and then  fifty years later  at the Three Hundred Fiftieth anniversary celebrations.In World War II  Hammond served as chief of the section for Monuments  Fine Arts  and Archives in the allied military government  seeing duty in Algiers  Palermo  Naples  London  Paris  Frankfurt  and Berlin. In Berlin  placed in charge of German art works saved from transportation to Russia by General Patton’s Third Army  he faced boxes marked ‘Rembrandt’ and ‘Rubens ’ which he considered unwise to open; he did  however  open another box  to find an original illustration by Botticelli for Dante’s Divine Comedy. His work  and that of many others  is recorded in Robert M. Edsel’s new book Rescuing da Vinci  which shows two photographs of the youthful Lieutenant Colonel Hammond. For his services in the war Hammond was awarded the Bronze Star  and was decorated by the governments of France  Holland  and Italy.In 1935  Professor Hammond married Florence Hobson Pierson of New Orleans  with whom he had three daughters who added to the splendid domesticity of Kirkland House. His classmate and fellow classicist  John H. Finley  fabled master of Eliot House  once said of his old friend that he “went off to conquer Rome but was conquered by Florence.”Hammond’s research and teaching were directed mainly to Roman constitutional history  ancient political thought  and Latin literature. These themes were exemplified in his first and last books  The Augustan Principate  1933; and The City in the Ancient World  1972. He also took a great interest in pedagogy  and all of his students remember the long scrawl of commentary which adorned each of their papers. He was among the few who used Harvard’s collection of ancient artifacts to illustrate literary texts and social history  and it was he who established and administered an A.M. in Teaching program for the classics. Furthermore  his edition of Plautus’ Miles Gloriosus was intended for students.To Harvard’s history he contributed extensively researched monographs on such topics as the stained glass in Memorial Hall  music at Commencement  Harvard china  Latin and Greek inscriptions on College buildings  and the gated enclosures of the Yard.For nearly seventy-five years Hammond maintained an almost unbroken record of participation in the daily service of Morning Prayers  and long after retirement he nourished his friendships among undergraduates through regular attendance at the Signet Society  whose graduate board he once served as president. Citizen  scholar  and mentor for longer than most of us have been alive  Mason Hammond loved and served Harvard. We remember him as among the best of a great generation.Fautor studiosis  sociis amicus  Grammaticae historiae morum magisterA support to his students  a friend to his colleagues  Master of grammar  history  and customsRespectfully submitted Wendell Vernon Clausen†Elliot Forbes†David G.

William Henry Bond,At a Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences December 12  2006  the following Minute was placed upon the records.William Henry Bond  last of the American scholar-librarians  was born in York  Pennsylvania  on August 14  1915  only child of Walter Laucks Bond  a manufacturer of pianos  and his wife Ethel Bane (Bossert) Bond. In 1933 he graduated salutatorian from William Penn Senior High School  and A. B. with honors in English  Phi Beta Kappa  from Haverford College in 1937. He came to Harvard as a graduate student in 1938  asking immediately at Widener Library to see Arber’s Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London and the first edition of John Milton’s Areopagitica. He earned the Ph.D. in English Philology in 1941 with a reception study of Sir Philip Sidney. The career path he had planned to culminate with a professorship in English Literature had been diverted when he took the seminar in descriptive bibliography under William Jackson  who spotted his natural acumen and sent him down to Wye Plantation on summer break to catalogue the collection of English Literature being formed by Arthur A. Houghton  Jr. Thereafter these three men worked together to house  enrich  index  publish  and open for research the historical collections of books and manuscripts in the College Library: Houghton  brilliant businessman  gifted collector  and architect manqué; Jackson  the greatest book mind of his generation and “Harvard’s Grand Acquisitor”; and Bond  the sound scholar-bibliographer  who would fit all the pieces together in dedicated service to his University.After enjoying research fellowships at the Huntington and Folger libraries he served in the U. S. Navy from 1942 to 1946  cracking codes with the bibliographers Fredson Bowers and Charlton Hinman. (His Japanese dictionary was a souvenir of that adventure.) He returned immediately to Harvard as William Jackson’s assistant at the Houghton Library  and in 1952 he took a house in Conantum (Concord)  where he spent idyllic years with his wife  Helen Elizabeth Lynch  their daughters Nancy and Sally  and a succession of beloved family dogs.In 1948 he was appointed the first Curator of Manuscripts in the Houghton Library  and after only twenty months he could report that through “simplification and consolidation” he had established the Manuscript Department  invented standards for cataloguing and classification (perfectly suited for the internet incarnation that would follow)  catalogued 20 929 pieces  including 660 codices  and produced 10 500 catalogue cards. His ability to read European handwriting in all periods and languages was legendary. All the while he demonstrated in the journals that he could solve bibliographical puzzles which had baffled others (casting off copy  half-sheet imposition  and the like). His copy of R. B. McKerrow’s Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students is broken open from the insertion of notes and pictures  its pages heavily marked with comments and call numbers of examples at Harvard—the armory of a great teacher. During these years he mastered the art of letterpress printing on the old Washington handpress in Lamont Library  educating himself on the effective relationship between the press and its products and issuing many a poppet over his proprietary imprint  Palimpsest Press.When the manuscript fragments of Christopher Smart’s “Jubilate Agno” came to him for accessioning  he perceived the antiphonal relation of the lines  establishing as a minor classic with his article and edition what had previously been considered disjointed ravings of a bedlamite. In 1955 he revealed Philip Hofer’s premier collection of Illuminated and Calligraphic Manuscripts with an exhibition and catalogue  and he edited the 626-page Supplement to the Census of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada in 1962.In 1964 William Jackson died and Bond succeeded him as Librarian of the Houghton Library (1965) and Professor of Bibliography (1967). He promoted his assistant  Rodney G. Dennis  to Curator of Manuscripts  and he recalled Roger E. Stoddard to the Library to assist him in accessions; those two worked fraternally under his sympathetic administration. He cultivated Donald and Mary Hyde in the hope  realized after Mary’s death  of securing for Harvard their celebrated collection of books and manuscripts by Dr. Samuel Johnson and his circle. In 1967 he edited both the selected papers of Jackson and a spectacular illustrated album featuring the various departments and collections of the Library  and in 1970 a collection of essays memorializing Donald F. Hyde. In 1971 he was called on to produce protocols  still in use  on “The Acquisition of Art ” thereby protecting the University from thoughtless acts that have caused much trouble in other institutions  and in 1973 he drafted the Bylaws for the new HU Librarians’ Assembly.He endured the lengthy excavation for the Pusey Library and the protracted renovation of Houghton’s second floor for future accommodation of the Hydes’s collection as well as unpleasant budget maneuvers from the central administration  all the while inspiring by his example collegial feelings and generous acts among his staff. A fortieth-anniversary library exhibition was dedicated to him upon his retirement in 1982  and he continued to teach until 1986. In 1981-82 Cambridge University appointed him Sandars Reader in Bibliography and in 1982-83 the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation granted him a fellowship in support of his study of Harvard’s great library benefactor  Thomas Hollis. His book  Thomas Hollis of Lincoln’s Inn  was published in 1990  with Hugh Amory he edited the early catalogues of the College Library (1996)  and he left at his death on November 18  2005 the completed manuscript of a “Checklist of Thomas Hollis’s [3 000] Gifts to the Harvard College Library.”He was elected president of the Bibliographical Society of America  the Club of Odd Volumes  and the Colonial Society of Massachusetts  and honorary member of the Harvard Class of 1937; and he was appointed councilor of the American Antiquarian Society and trustee of the Concord Free Public Library  Historic Deerfield  and the R. W. Emerson Memorial Association.An English colleague  A. R. A. Hobson  writes “He was the most upright man I have known.” As the Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes describes him: “He represented the best of life at Harvard and for so long and for so many.”Respectfully submitted Daniel AaronRodney G. Dennis †James EngellMichael ShinagelRoger E.

James L. McKenney of Business School  77,Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus James L. McKenney  an expert in management information systems and the use of computer systems for teaching management  died on March 28 in Belmont  Mass. He was 77 years old.In 1960  shortly after earning his doctorate at the University of California  Los Angeles (UCLA)  McKenney was the first information systems expert appointed to the Harvard Business School (HBS) faculty. He became a full professor with tenure in 1968 and was named the John G. McLean Professor of Business Administration in 1989. He retired from the active faculty in 1996.“Jim McKenney came to HBS at the cusp of the transition from the industrial age to the information age and brought a deep technical competence to issues ” said F. Warren McFarlan  the School’s T.J. Dermot Dunphy Baker Foundation Professor of Business Administration.“For more than 30 years  he drove the School and the entire IT community to the frontiers of the field and to the study of how information technology could be applied effectively. He had invaluable foresight and was always decades ahead of practice. As early as 1969  for example  he sensed the importance of the initial work on the Internet and worked hard to convince others  including me  how significant it would become ” McFarlan said.McKenney introduced the first computer-based simulation exercise  the Business Game  to the required first-year MBA curriculum in the 1960s and later created the first on-line computing facility at HBS. By playing the game  students learned how to use IT for business planning and management long before personal computers were invented.McKenney’s research focused on managing the implementation and growth of intelligent terminal communications systems  knowledge-based systems  and the design and management of private communications systems. He was the author or co-author of several books  including “Corporate Information Systems Management: Issues Facing Senior Executives” and “Corporate Information Systems Management: The Challenges of Managing in an Information Age.”His articles appeared in numerous publications  including Management Science  Public Administration Review  Annals of the History of Computers  and Harvard Business Review. In a series of articles in Harvard Business Review in 1982 and 1983  McKenney and McFarlan coined the phrase “archipelago of information services.” The phrase is now commonly used to refer to the need to coordinate activities of different information services and the managerial and administrative problems caused by the dispersion of those activities within different administrative units of an organization.Active in all the Business School’s educational programs  McKenney taught many courses  including “Information Systems and Control ” “Foundations of Computer Systems ” and “Management of Natural Resources.” He also taught in the required MBA courses in Control (now Financial Reporting and Control) and Production and Operations Management (now Technology and Operations Management). While chairman of the Production and Operations Management area from 1968 to 1972  he served as the School’s director of computer services. In 1969  he was one of the founders of the Executive Education program “Managing the Information System.” The program is still offered under the title “Delivering Information Services.”In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of information systems  McKenney received an Association for Information Systems Fellow Award in 2001.Born and raised in Chicago  he graduated from Purdue University in 1952 with a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering before receiving his Ph.D. from UCLA  the first doctorate granted by that institution in quantitative methods.McKenney was easily recognizable on the HBS campus. He always wore a bow tie  and the cut of his face and beard reminded passersby of Abraham Lincoln.He had a second home in Wisdom  Mont. “He had spent years working with the U.S. Forest Service  trying to help them improve their natural resource management ” his son William remembered. “He loved the outdoors and was an avid fly fisherman. The house in Montana was part of a large working cattle ranch  and at times my father was actively involved in running it.”After his retirement  McKenney continued his research on management information systems  working on a longitudinal study of the grocery industry to trace consumer response and the evolution of the use of information technology in organizational change.In addition to William  of Lexington  Mass.  McKenney is also survived by his wife  Mary (Keating); two other children  James E. of East Greenwich  R.I.  and Katherine Wesnousky of Davis  Calif.; and eight grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on April 7 at the First Parish Church  7 Harrington Road  Lexington  Mass.In lieu of flowers  donations can be made to the Memory Disorders Unit  c/o Dr. John Growden  Massachusetts General Hospital  15 Parkman St.  Boston  MA 02114.
Whittenberger  HSPH chair  dies at 93,James Whittenberger  who chaired the Department of Physiology at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) from 1948 to 1980  passed away March 17. He was 93 years old. Whittenberger established what would become the Harvard NIEHS Center for Environmental Health at the School in 1958  12 years before the federal Environmental Protection Agency was established. From 1969 to 1970  he was a member of the President’s Task Force on Air Pollution.Whittenberger earned an S.B. and then an M.D. in 1938 from the University of Chicago. There  he worked as a fellow in surgery under Charles B. Huggins  who later earned a Nobel Prize in medicine. During World War II and immediately afterward  Whittenberger served with the U.S. Army Medical Corps.Whittenberger came to HSPH in 1946 and worked with Cecil Drinker  former dean of the School  and Philip Drinker  co-developer of the iron lung. In 1951  Whittenberger became a professor of physiology and seven years later was named James Stevens Simmons Professor of Public Health. He served as associate dean for academic affairs from 1966 to 1972 and then as associate dean of the Faculty of Public Health until 1978.In his early career  Whittenberger studied respiratory mechanics and the use of artificial ventilation in polio patients. Later  he examined pollution’s effects on the physiology of respiratory systems. To accomplish this research  Whittenberger incorporated toxicology and epidemiology into the Department of Physiology.Whittenberger founded and directed the Kresge Center for Environmental Health at HSPH  now called the Harvard National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Center for Environmental Health. Whittenberger worked to expand the center’s scope to encompass other fields that contribute to the scientific base of environmental health. Now in its 43rd year  the center includes researchers in the fields of biostatistics  genetics and complex diseases  nutrition  epidemiology  radiation sciences  and toxicology.From the 1950s to the 1980s  Whittenberger served on a multitude of committees and panels for agencies such as the National Institutes of Health  NIEHS  the Environmental Protection Agency  the National Research Council  the Food and Drug Administration  the National Center for Health Statistics  the President’s Biomedical Research Panel  and the Ford Foundation.He served on the President’s Science Advisory Committee as a member of the Environmental Pollution Panel (1964 to 1965) and as a member of the Panel on Chemicals and Health (1970 to 1972).In the 1970s  he co-chaired the first and second task forces for research planning in environmental health sciences for NIEHS. This work led to the publication of the influential reports “Man’s Health and the Environment: Some Research Needs” and “Human Health and the Environment: Some Research Needs ” intended to guide national planning efforts in environmental health research.After retiring from HSPH in 1980  Whittenberger became the director of the Southern Occupational Health Center  University of California  Irvine. He also was professor in residence in the Department of Community and Environmental Medicine  College of Medicine  Irvine  and in the Division of Environmental Sciences  School of Public Health  University of California  Los Angeles.A memorial service is being planned. More information will be provided as details become available.
Richard Musgrave  renowned pioneer of public finance  dies at 96,Richard A. Musgrave  widely regarded as the founder of modern public finance and an adviser on fiscal policy and taxation to governments from Washington to Bogotá to Tokyo  died Monday (Jan. 15) in Santa Cruz  Calif.Musgrave  96  was professor emeritus of economics at Harvard University and adjunct professor of economics at the University of California  Santa Cruz. His wife  Peggy Boswell Musgrave  said Musgrave died of natural causes.A staunch believer that government can play a positive and constructive role in society  Musgrave also believed deeply that economists can contribute to making government work well  thereby contributing to a better society. His work on public finance has been described as his “attempt to marry the theory and practice of good government.”“Richard Musgrave transformed economics in the 1950s and 1960s from a descriptive and institutional subject to one that used the tools of microeconomics and Keynesian macroeconomics to understand the effects of taxes ” said Martin Feldstein  George F. Baker Professor of Economics at Harvard and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research.“Richard Musgrave was a giant – a towering figure who transformed the field of public economics ” added David M. Cutler  Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics and dean for the social sciences in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.An academic economist for the past 60 years  Musgrave mixed his university work with a wide range of public service and consultation. Starting in the 1940s  he advised governments in Colombia  Chile  Myanmar  Japan  Puerto Rico  South Korea  and Taiwan on taxation and fiscal policy  and led tax reform commissions in Colombia and Bolivia.Similarly  domestic agencies and congressional committees repeatedly sought Musgrave’s advice on public finance policy questions. He worked with or as a consultant to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  the U.S. Treasury  the President’s Council of Economic Advisers  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  and the World Bank.Musgrave described the setting of tax policy as a delicate orchestration of factors including employment  inflation  economic growth  and the fair distribution of the tax burden – with the latter generally assigned outsize importance  in Musgrave’s view.“Clearly  tax policy is not simply a matter of raising revenue in an equitable fashion ” he and his wife  then an economist at the University of California  Berkeley  wrote in the Boston Globe in 1978. “The entire performance of the economy must be allowed for as well  though this should be done with least damage to the fairness of the tax system.”Two of Musgrave’s books became classics in their field: “The Theory of Public Finance: A Study in Public Economy” (1958) and “Public Finance in Theory and Practice ” co-authored with Peggy Musgrave (1973).“Intelligent conduct of government is at the heart of democracy ” Musgrave wrote in the introduction to “The Theory of Public Finance.” “It requires an understanding of the economic relations involved; and the economist  by aiding in this understanding  may hope to contribute to a better society. This is why the field of public finance has seemed of particular interest to me; and this is why my interest in the field has been motivated by a search for the good society  no less than by scientific curiosity.”“The Theory of Public Finance” transformed the study of public finance to a discipline in which questions are analyzed in general equilibrium terms  where changes in tax policy take into account the resulting changes in the economy. Musgrave’s many intellectual contributions included studies on tax incidence  tax progressivity  public goods  fiscal federalism  the effects of taxation on risk-taking  and the role of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy.Musgrave’s influence endured throughout his lengthy career. In 1998  he was invited by the University of Munich to join his “archrival” in the study of political economy  James M. Buchanan  in a five-day debate. The results were published in 1999 as “Public Finance and Public Choice: Two Contrasting Visions of the State.”“Two towering pillars of 20th century public economics examine the deep foundations of their own thought and their common subject ” economist Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote of the work. “Who could resist the chance to eavesdrop on their reflections? Certainly not anyone who cares about the role of government in modern society.”Born Dec. 14  1910  in Koenigstein  Germany  Richard Abel Musgrave studied at the University of Munich  Exeter College  and the University of Heidelberg  where he received his Diplom Volkswirt (the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree) in 1933. He continued his studies at the University of Rochester and at Harvard  where he received an A.M. degree in 1936 and a Ph.D. in 1937.Musgrave was an instructor in economics at Harvard until 1941  when he became an economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors  a position he held until 1947. He taught economics at Swarthmore College from 1947 to 1948  following which he was an economics professor at the University of Michigan from 1948 to 1958; at Johns Hopkins University from 1958 to 1961; and at Princeton University from 1962 to 1965.In 1965  Musgrave joined Harvard as professor of economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and at Harvard Law School. He was named H.H. Burbank Professor of Economics in 1969  when he also became chair of Harvard’s standing committee on Afro-American Studies. In 1981  he was named professor emeritus at Harvard and became an adjunct professor at the University of California  Santa Cruz  remaining affiliated with that campus through 2004.Among his numerous awards and honors  Musgrave was a Fulbright professor in Germany in 1956 and held a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959. He was named honorary president of the International Institute of Public Finance in 1978  the same year he was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economics Association. He received the Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy in 1981. In 1983  50 years to the day after he received his Diplom Volkswirt  Musgrave was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Heidelberg  his alma mater. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986  and in 1994  he received the Daniel M. Holland Medal from the National Tax Association.Musgrave is survived by his wife  Peggy Boswell Musgrave  and three stepchildren: Pamela Clyne of New Jersey  Roger Richmond of California  and Thomas Richmond of Colorado. He is also survived by numerous nephews and nieces  including Harry Krause  the Max L. Rowe Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois College of Law. Details regarding a memorial service have not been finalized.
Orlov Rubinow  former Harvard University Press editor  dies at 81,Betty Ann Orlov Rubinow  81  formerly of Cambridge  Mass.  and Stowe  Vt.  died unexpectedly from complications of pneumonia on Jan. 5 at St. Joseph’s Hospital  Tucson  Ariz.  where she had lived with her husband  Merrill Rubinow.Born Dec. 23  1925  the daughter of Meyer and Beverly Orlov  her early years were spent in Brookline  Mass. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and did graduate work at Harvard University. Her career in editing began at the Harvard University Press  where she eventually became the editor for the behavioral sciences.Rubinow possessed an indomitable spirit as well as an intellectual curiosity that fueled her interest in a broad range of people  subjects  and causes. A staunch advocate for civil rights  she was one of the founders of the Boston Chapter of the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity. Her home became a meeting place for those involved in welfare and education reform.After she left the Harvard Press  Rubinow created Langdon Press  publishing books on her own. She also worked as a freelance writer and consultant. In 1974  she conceived the idea of an encyclopedia of American ethnic groups. After connecting with the History Department at Harvard and obtaining funding from the Office of Education  the National Endowment for the Humanities  and the Rockefeller Foundation  she became the managing editor. The Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups was published in 1980 by Harvard University Press and was presented to President Carter in the White House.In the 1980s  Rubinow moved to Stowe  Vt. She pursued biblical studies at St. Michael’s College in Winooski  Vt.  the General Theological Seminary in New York City  and the Jesuit Faculty of Theology at Regis College in Toronto  from which she received her M.Div. in 1996. In 1996  she went to St. George’s College in Jerusalem to pursue Jewish Studies.Rubinow tells the story of the last chapter in her life when she reconnected with a person from her past: “We met originally in July 1943 in a Boston hospital. That September he went to war  I entered Bryn Mawr  and we exchanged V-mail letters almost daily for the next two years. In May 1946  Dr. [Merrill] Rubinow was finally discharged from the Army Medical Corps  eager to get married and get on with his life. Ten years younger  and a college junior  I was not ready for that commitment. Sadly  we went our separate ways and never exchanged a word for 56 years. Then  miraculously  after the death of his first wife  he located me through a relative  and in June 2002  we met at his 65th Harvard Class Reunion. Reconnecting instantly and ‘surprised by joy ’ we were married two months later and blessed with four wonderful years in Tuscon.”Donations may be made to the Friends of St. Andrew’s Biblical Theological College  the TMC Cancer Institute  Tucson  Ariz.  or St. John’s-in-the-Mountains  Stowe.A memorial service will be held in Stowe at St. John’s-in-the-Mountains  which is planned on being held on May 5. Also  in accord with the wishes of friends and extended family  plans are being made for a memorial service in Tucson.
Elkan Blout  former HSPH academic affairs dean  87,Elkan Blout  a former dean for academic affairs at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH)  National Medal of Science winner  and a leading contributor to the development of instant film  died on Dec. 20  2006  at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The cause was pneumonia. He was 87.Blout was the Edward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Emeritus at Harvard Medical School (HMS). His career was marked by excellence in multiple disciplines. His early achievements in the lab were matched by his later leadership as an administrator.His pathbreaking work in chemistry helped illuminate the large  complex structure of proteins  critical to understanding their function. It is for this work  as well as his “devotion to the scientific enterprise of this nation” that he received the National Medal of Science  the nation’s highest scientific honor  from President George H.W. Bush on Nov. 13  1990.“Elkan Blout possessed rare gifts of scholarship  pragmatism  leadership  and vision from which our School  our institution  and the nation’s larger scientific community benefited greatly ” said HSPH Dean Barry Bloom in a press release.Blout received a doctorate in chemistry from Columbia University in 1942 and  after a year as a research fellow in chemistry at Harvard  was recruited by Edwin Land to the research division of the newly created Polaroid Corp. He rose to become associate director of research and then vice president and general manager of research  heading the team that developed instant color film. He held more than 50 patents in the field and led the team of chemists that synthesized more than 5 000 compounds in search of the key ingredients of the Polaroid color process.In 1950  Blout reapplied his research skills to the academic world  becoming a research associate in pathology at HMS. He continued to serve at Polaroid through 1962  even as he began to investigate the chemistry and biochemistry of proteins in his research at HMS and Children’s Hospital.Blout shifted his efforts to academia full time in 1962  becoming professor of biological chemistry at HMS and chairing the Department of Biological Chemistry from 1965 to 1969.He became the dean for academic affairs at HSPH in 1978  holding the post until 1989. He also established the Office for Continuing Education at the School in 1982 and served as chairman of the Department of Environmental Science and Physiology from 1986 to 1988.In 1986 he helped create HSPH’s Division of Biological Sciences  bringing all of the lab sciences together under one administration  serving as the division’s director from 1987 through 1991. Shortly before his retirement from Harvard in 1991  two professorships were created in Blout’s honor  one at HSPH and one at HMS  “to recognize Dr. Blout’s remarkable contributions at different stages of his career to the faculties of both schools.”He was named senior adviser for science to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1991  helping develop the agency’s scientific capabilities and working on scientific strategic planning.Blout received many honors and awards  including honorary degrees from Harvard University in 1962 and Loyola University in 1976. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  for which he served as treasurer from 1992 to 1998  and a member of the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences  for which he served as treasurer from 1980 to 1992  overseeing a fivefold increase in the organization’s endowment. He was also an elected foreign member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.Blout is survived by his wife  Gail  and his children  James  Susan Merry Lausch  William  and Darya.– HSPH Office of Communications
HSPH’s Andrew Spielman dies at 76,When Andrew Spielman was a graduate student in a malaria lab at Johns Hopkins University in 1952  his future was anything but certain. The use of DDT and other insecticides suggested a dramatic curtailing of the spread of mosquitoes – the carriers of the malaria pathogen and additional diseases. But  true to form  the insects proved remarkably resilient  and Spielman embarked on a career that would make him one of the most prominent experts in vector-borne illnesses  such as malaria  Lyme disease  and dengue  in the world. That career ended on Dec. 20  2006  when Spielman  professor of tropical public health in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH)  passed away after a sudden illness.His accomplishments and those of his lab associates read like a brief modern history of public health entomology. HSPH colleagues Richard Pollack and Sam Telford recounted some of them in a draft on which they are working about Spielman: the first description of the life cycles and ecology of the agents of human babesiosis and Lyme disease; a focus on the role of saliva and its production in vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes in transmitting disease; the first uses of growth regulators to interfere with normal mosquito development to aid mosquito control; and the exploration of the possibility that roosting birds play a key part in perpetuating the viruses that cause eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile encephalitis.Perhaps Spielman will be equally remembered for his sense of humor and his delight in his work. Facile in explaining complex disease cycles  he was as comfortable in describing the bizarre mating rituals of certain mosquitoes or the mechanism by which ticks embed their mouthparts into skin to suck blood. In several interviews with HPH NOW  he seemed captivated with disease transmission  particularly in relation to mosquitoes  which thrive in all corners of the world  and yet  as Spielman pointed out  contribute nothing to ecology and fell humans in the millions with the pathogens they carry.Recalled Michael D’Antonio  who co-authored a popular book with Spielman  “Mosquito: A Natural History of Our Most Persistent and Deadly Foe ” “Andy was so enthusiastic and energetic. He understood what made his subject matter of interest to everyone. I think a lot of scientists have excitement about their work  but they cannot translate that excitement to the public. Andy knew how to do that.”Spielman divided his time between the lab and the field. In perhaps the most famous example of his crosscutting work  Spielman traveled to Nantucket in a series of visits in the 1970s to investigate rare outbreaks of human babesiosis  a disease that usually affects animals and that destroys red blood cells. He trapped voles and mice and literally picked ticks from the animals’ skins. He then focused on lab work  successfully infecting hamsters with the babesia protozoa through the bites of infected deer ticks. Through this work  Spielman identified the tick responsible for the so-called “Nantucket fever” and pointed to the white-footed mouse as the pathogen’s reservoir. Later  the same kind of tick was shown to be the vector for Lyme disease.Spielman encouraged this same kind of marriage between lab and fieldwork among a generation of students and postdoctoral fellows whom he mentored  said Pollack  who worked with Spielman in the Laboratory of Public Health Entomology at HSPH starting in 1988. Said Dyann Wirth  chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases  who has known Spielman since the early 1980s  “His greatest legacy may be the people he trained. He won numerous awards for excellence in teaching  and many of his students have gone on to positions of leadership.”Spielman’s sense of discovery was reflected in his adventurous nature. “I had the pleasure of accompanying Andy on many international travels and travails ” remembered Pollack. “Somehow  he and I survived his shortcuts over guarded fences  past other life-threatening hazards  and some fairly revolting cuisines. Once field trips were scheduled for his classes  there was no changing them  regardless of the weather. The higher the seas – the broader his smile while onboard the ferry to Nantucket.”Spielman’s daughter  Sue  remembered fondly calling him “Indiana Daddy ” in reference to the intrepid character in the movie “Indiana Jones” played by Harrison Ford. From the time of his college years  said Sue  Spielman reveled in nature – spelunking and climbing cliffs. She recalled spending weekend camping trips as a child on the sand dunes in Provincetown – in winter – as she and her sister accompanied their brother and father on Boy Scout trips led by Spielman.“He brought a boyish excitement to everything he did ” said Sue Spielman. “I think that inspired people. Science and discovery were central parts of who he was.”Spielman came to HSPH in 1959 as an instructor in the Department of Tropical Public Health  later the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. He authored more than 360 publications. “He had a singularly holistic view of the balance between man and mosquitoes and between the biology and ecology of both ” said HSPH Dean Barry Bloom in a press release.Spielman was also a faculty associate in the Center for International Development at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and was head of the Laboratory of Public Health Entomology at HSPH.He is survived by his wife  Judy  and their children  David  Deborah  and Sue Spielman; seven grandchildren; and by a brother  Herbert Spielman.– Richard Pollack and Sam Telford contributed to the research for this article.
Classicist  medievalist Bloch dies at 95,Herbert Bloch  Pope Professor of the Latin Language and Literature Emeritus  died on Sept. 6 in Cambridge  Mass. Bloch was born in Berlin on Aug. 18  1911. He studied ancient history  classical philology  and archaeology at the University of Berlin (1930-1933)  which he left for Rome. Owing to the vicissitudes of fate  his brother Egon remained in Germany and died in the Holocaust.Bloch received his doctoral degree in Roman history in 1935 and the Diploma di perfezionamento in 1937 from the University of Rome  where he was a student of the eminent historian Arnaldo Momigliano. Bloch remained in Italy  serving as a member of the staff of the excavations in Ostia in 1938. During these years he not only honed his skills as a scholar but also developed a facility in Italian that remained with him his entire life.Owing to the pressures of the anti-Semitic laws enacted in Italy in late 1938  Bloch was soon no longer able to remain in the country that had sheltered him initially. In 1939 he emigrated to the United States. George Hanfmann (1911-1986)  the art historian and archaeologist at Harvard who had been a student with Bloch in Berlin  played a role in securing him a connection with the University. Bloch was to have been in the first group of fellows at Dumbarton Oaks  one of Harvard’s centers in Washington  D.C. At the time  John Finley (1904-1995) was acting chair of the Department of the Classics. When Carl Newell Jackson  Eliot Professor of Greek  fell ill  Finley hired Bloch to take over his teaching. It was arranged for Bloch to defer his junior fellowship in Washington by a year.In retrospect  the war years were the beginning of unbroken stability in Bloch’s life  as from 1941 to 1982 he taught at Harvard University. At the same time it must be acknowledged that he remained stateless through the end of the war  when he had to go to Montreal to secure his citizenship papers. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1946.His gratitude to the United States for having given him a haven was great. Equally strong was his resistance to any whiff of intolerance or persecution. In 1954  he was approached by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton about the possibility of a permanent position there  but decided against it at least partly because he was horrified that the chairman of the board of trustees of the institute testified in Washington against J. Robert Oppenheimer. In contrast  Nathan Pusey  the recently appointed president of Harvard at the time  had stood up to Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Fifteen years later (1969)  Bloch himself took a stand by delivering a speech to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences against the students who had taken over University Hall. He regarded them as being similar to the Nazi youths he had seen early in his life.At Harvard  Bloch rose swiftly through the ranks  as instructor for one year (1941 to 1942)  faculty instructor for four  and assistant professor for one  before being tenured as associate professor. He was professor for 20 years  after which he held the Pope Professorship of the Latin Language and Literature.His teaching and research interests involved Greek and Roman historiography  Latin epigraphy  Roman archaeology (especially architecture)  medieval history  and medieval Latin literature. Through his courses he advanced medieval studies in particular  by inspiring a cadre of students who have now become eminent in their own right.In all the areas already mentioned  Bloch made a major impact in his scholarship. Among his most enduring contributions to classics are his works on Roman brick-stamps  which enable archaeologists and historians to date buildings and trace economic ties related to their construction by matching the brick-stamps to their brickyards of origin. Another longstanding commitment of Bloch’s was to what used to be labeled “the final pagan revival in the West” in the late fourth century.Among medievalists he is known best for many books and articles on Monte Cassino. His crowning achievement was the three volumes of “Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages ” which appeared in 1986. This opus  which is exemplary in bringing together evidence from historical texts with insights gleaned from works of art  was awarded the Praemium Urbis in Rome in 1987 and the Haskins Medal of the Medieval Academy in 1988. Although all this work is uniquely his own  Bloch’s Monte Cassino oeuvre also bears witness to the extraordinary support of his second wife  Ellen  who not only drove him to many of the out-of-the-way places in Italy he needed to visit but also took many of the photographs with which the three volumes are illustrated.Professor Bloch attained all the types of recognition that one might expect. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Fellow; member of the Institute for Advanced Study  Princeton; syndic of Harvard University Press; senior fellow of the Society of Fellows  and trustee of the Loeb Classical Library. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  American Philosophical Society  Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia (honorary member since 1990)  German Archaeological Institute  Zentraldirektion of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica  and Finnish Academy of Science and Letters. In 1999 he was distinguished by the Premio “Cultori di Roma.”Although this attenuated enumeration of Bloch’s career gives a glimpse of achievements and values  it fails to capture his physical presence – what death has now wrested from us. A tall and lean man  Bloch had an Old World courtliness; a captivatingly resonant  deep voice; a modesty; and a genuine interest in the activities of others that endeared him to those who knew him. During his half century or so of living in Belmont  Mass.  he loved to take long walks in the conservation land adjacent to his property. In those woods he knew the precise number and location of all the lady’s slippers and could compare the totals in a given year with those of earlier ones. He cared deeply about the earth  to which he has now returned.Bloch is survived by his twin daughters  Anne Bloch  of Arlington  Mass.  and Mary Alice (Nini) Bloch  of Bedford  Mass. They are his daughters by his first wife  Clarissa (née Holland)  who came from the Boston area. She died suddenly while they were traveling together in Germany in August 1958. His second wife  Ellen (née Cohen) of Memphis  Tenn.  died in May 1987.There will be no funeral service  but a memorial service will be held on Saturday  Oct. 21  at 1 p.m. at The First Church in Belmont  404 Concord Ave. (corner of Concord and Common).– Professor Jan ZiolkowskiChair of the Department of the Classics

Founder of Harvard’s Statistics Department  Frederick Mosteller  dies,Pioneering statistician Frederick Mosteller  a retired Harvard professor whose broad-ranging work influenced public health  medicine  education  and even American history  died Sunday (July 23) at age 89.Mosteller was influential in the founding of Harvard’s Statistics Department in 1957 and served as the department’s first chairman. He went on to chair three other departments at Harvard  a feat that remains unmatched.Friends and colleagues hailed Mosteller as a pioneer in his field  a caring teacher  and one of the most influential statisticians of his time.In a notice to the members of the Harvard School of Public Health community  Dean Barry Bloom credited Mosteller with transforming the School’s Department of Biostatistics into one of the top such departments in the world. He called Mosteller “a giant in his field” and a “major force in statistics teaching at all levels.”“He is still referred to in discussions of statistical and epidemiological issues as setting the intellectual gold standard ” Bloom said.Mosteller spent the early years of his Harvard career in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences  chairing the Department of Social Relations and the Statistics Department  the latter for 15 years on three different occasions. In the late 1970s  he became chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Biostatistics  subsequently also chairing the School’s Department of Health Policy and Management.He retired in 1987. Though he left his daily teaching duties  Mosteller continued working  serving as director of the Technology Assessment Program at the Harvard School of Public Health and as chair of the Center for Evaluation in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences’ Initiatives for Children program  which analyzed the effectiveness of educational programs aimed at children and youth.Stephen Stigler  chairman of the University of Chicago’s Statistics Department and a longtime friend  said Mosteller worked tirelessly “building bridges between academic statistics and the broader world ” and was “universally admired and respected as the senior statesman of our field.”“He had superb statistical judgment and a knowledge of our science that was both broad and deep. With his finely honed social conscience  this made him one of the most effective statisticians in the world over the past half-century ” Stigler said. “We shall miss him greatly.”Xiao-Li Meng  chair of Harvard’s Statistics Department  called Mosteller’s contribution to the department and to the statistical community “unmeasurable” while Jeremy R. Knowles  dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences  referred to Mosteller as a scholar  teacher  and admired member of Harvard’s community.“Professor Mosteller was a founding figure in Harvard’s Statistics Department  a prolific scholar and generous advisor to students  a leader in introducing statistics into American secondary education  and an admired and intellectually eclectic citizen of the University ” Knowles said. “He was  simply  a wonderful man.”Mosteller was born in West Virginia in 1916 and spent his teenage years in Pennsylvania. He attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology  now Carnegie-Mellon University  earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics. He continued his graduate studies at Princeton University  receiving a master of arts degree in 1941 and a doctorate in 1946. He began his Harvard career that same year  as a lecturer in the Department of Social Relations.In 1948  Mosteller assisted in one of the first large  multi-center evaluations in public health and one of the first collaborations between statisticians and physicians. The National Halothane Study examined the effects of an anesthetic suspected in the deaths of several patients. It covered 34 institutions and 865 000 patients  finding no evidence that halothane posed a higher risk than other anesthetics. It was one of the early uses of both biostatistics and a large mainframe computer for statistical computing.Mosteller would go on to apply statistics to a wide variety of subjects  including the effectiveness of different surgical techniques  the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction  and the importance of family income and of smaller class sizes in educational success. Mosteller collaborated with Daniel Patrick Moynihan  then a Professor of Government at Harvard  on the influential 1972 report “Equality of Educational Opportunity.” He produced other classic statistics texts with his lifelong collaborator and friend  John Tukey of Princeton.Bloom credited Mosteller’s work in meta-analysis  or the study of other studies  with adding another weapon to the public health “statistical armament ” allowing risk factors and other results to be gleaned from different data sets.In 1962  Mosteller and colleague David Wallace from the University of Chicago conducted a statistical analysis of the language of 12 Federalist Papers  written anonymously during the country’s founding  urging ratification of the Constitution. Either James Madison or Alexander Hamilton was thought to be the author of the 12 papers. Mosteller and Wallace concluded from analysis of sentence length and the use of certain words that Madison was the author.The author of more than 300 journal articles and editor  author  or contributor to dozens of books  Mosteller was a prolific writer. He earned numerous awards and honors  including honorary degrees from the University of Chicago  Carnegie-Mellon University  Yale University  Wesleyan University  and Harvard.Mosteller is survived by his son  William  his daughter  Gale Mosteller  an economist who collaborated with him  and his grandson  Hobart Reynolds.Visiting hours will be held July 27 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Arlington (Virginia) Funeral Home  3901 North Fairfax Drive. A memorial service is planned for later this year but has yet to be scheduled.
Music Dept.’s beloved Elliot Forbes  88,Elliot Forbes  the Fanny Peabody Professor of Music Emeritus  died Jan. 10 at his home in Cambridge  Mass. He was 88.A member of an old Boston family with numerous Harvard connections  Forbes was the son of Fogg Museum Director Edward Waldo Forbes and the great-grandson of poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson.Forbes grew up in Cambridge  attending Shady Hill and Milton Academy. After earning an A.B. from Harvard in 1941 and an A.M. in 1947  he taught for 11 years at Princeton University  then joined the Harvard music faculty in 1958  serving as chairman of the department from 1972 to 1976. He was conductor of the Harvard Glee Club and the Radcliffe Choral Society from 1958 to 1970 and toured with the Glee Club throughout the United States and Asia. He retired in 1984.The author of numerous scholarly articles  Forbes is best known for editing and revising “Thayer’s Life of Beethoven” (1964) and as the author of “A History of Music at Harvard” (1988).“Elliot Forbes  who wrote the history of the Music Department  made a lot of its history himself ” said Thomas Kelly  the Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music. “He leaves a huge void  one that we can fill only by remembering El’s uncanny ability to make you feel that seeing you was the most important thing that had ever happened to him. You always felt better about yourself because El Forbes was so glad to see you. He was a gifted teacher  an inspiring musician  and possibly the nicest human being ever created.”Lewis Lockwood  the Fanny Peabody Research Professor of Music  who first met Forbes when he was a graduate student in a course on Beethoven that Forbes gave at Princeton in the mid-1950s  said that his own later work as a Beethoven scholar was stimulated by Forbes’ work and teaching.“‘Thayer-Forbes ’ as Beethoven scholars call it  is a classic text  and Forbes’ annotations of Thayer’s book made this 19th century book available to contemporary readers in an authoritative version ” Lockwood said.In addition to his scholarship  Forbes’ personality had a powerful effect on those around him  said Lockwood  who joined the Harvard music faculty in 1980.“He epitomized music at Harvard in many ways and for many people  both as choral conductor and as lecturer. He had a way of making everyone who met him look on the bright side of things. His enthusiasm for music  music-making  and choral singing was infectious. He loved Harvard  took pleasure in all things Harvardian  and in his retirement wrote a history of the Harvard Music Department  something that no one else had done ” Lockwood said.In his retirement  Forbes continued to be a presence at Harvard  closely following and supporting the activities of the music department as well as being a regular at morning prayers in Appleton Chapel.“I thought the world of El ” said Jameson Marvin  senior lecturer on music and director of choral activities. “He was unbelievably kind and thoughtful  a real gentleman. He came to practically every Harvard musical event  and he loved to know about all the students in the Glee Club. He was a positive spirit  a real joie de vivre sort of person.”Forbes is survived by his wife Kathleen A. Forbes; a sister  Anne Forbes of Groton  Mass.; three daughters  Diana Forbes Droste of Watertown  Mass.  Barbara Forbes Purser of Skye  Scotland  and Susan Forbes Johnson of Plymouth  Mass.; and four grandchildren.A memorial service is planned at the the Memorial Church on Feb. 25  at 11 a.m.
Gwynne Evans  Renaissance lit scholar  at 93,G. (Gwynne) Blakemore Evans  Cabot Professor of English Literature Emeritus at Harvard University and this country’s most distinguished editor of Shakespeare’s plays and poems  died on Dec. 23  2005  at his home in Cambridge  Mass. He was 93. His death was the result of complications that followed a recent stroke.Evans was a scholar of Renaissance (now called  but not by him  Early Modern English) literature  publishing articles and editing the writings of a number of 16th and 17th century authors  but it is with Shakespeare that his scholarly reputation is forever linked. He edited in individual volumes “Richard III” (Pelican)  “Romeo and Juliet” and the “Sonnets” (both Cambridge)  the Variorum Supplement to “1 Henry IV ” and  most significantly  “The Riverside Shakespeare” (Houghton Mifflin  1974; 1997)  the complete one-volume Shakespeare  which dominated the scholarly market for a quarter century.Evans  whose father was for many years the much-admired chair of the German Department at Ohio State University  began his teaching career at Brooklyn College in the early 1940s  then served in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps in England at Bletchley Park  where allied code-breakers cracked the German Enigma Code. When asked about his own role in this vital project  Evans would  in his customary self-deprecating manner  reply that he had not helped to break the German code but had succeeded in deciphering the code of the allied Free French. Upon his return from England  Evans moved to the University of Wisconsin and then to the University of Illinois  where he taught for 20 years and edited the Journal of English and Germanic Philology. Moving to Harvard in 1967  he was just in time to experience the student protests of 1969  and he recalled patrolling the library to protect volumes from political activists. He was successful. No books were taken under his watch.Evans was the recipient of a Festschrift  “In the Company of Shakespeare: Essays On English Renaissance Literature ” on the occasion of his 90th birthday. The volume was a collection of essays written by his former students and academic friends  who came from Arizona  Utah  Texas  Wisconsin  Missouri  and New York to celebrate the appearance of the volume with a memorable reception in the very room at the Houghton Library where Evans had first led a seminar at Harvard. Among the very many words of appreciation for his accomplishments and academic and personal support were those of his old friend and colleague Professor Marvin Spevack of Munster  Germany  who expressed best the image the contributors held of Evans: that of a knight  one more Galahad than Lancelot.Evans took special care to advance and support the careers of his students and advisees with letters of recommendation that were works of art  and wonderfully effective  as the many who were fortunate to have his support can attest. One small instance of his generosity was his inviting younger scholars on sabbatical or otherwise free to use his office and smaller desk as his “assistant.” Several scholars profited from this Dickensian Bob Cratchit role in the cheerful employ of an always already-born-again Ebenezer Scrooge.Evans  who knew the influence of his text on readers and scholars  enjoyed especially the particular anecdote told by one of his students who was caught up in the Entebbe raid. In order to protect his young daughter in his arms as they left the plane  he placed the Riverside Shakespeare (a several-hundred-page hardcover) in front of her as a shield. When the passengers later had some  but not all  of their seized possessions returned to them  the student was handed the Riverside with the words  “you may have this back  for it is a holy book.”Gwynne Evans was not a holy man  though some thought him so. Rather  as Hamlet said of his father  “he was a man  take him for all in all:/I shall not look upon his like again ” or  as one version has it  “he was as good as it gets.” He had a slender  erect bearing with a handsome face  and a posture and mien reminiscent of T.S. Eliot. His manners were those of the generation of his youth  extending to the doffing of his hat when women entered the elevator in the Widener Library at Harvard. Within his old-school sense of chivalric distance and propriety  there was  in the words of his friend and Harvard colleague Professor Daniel Aaron  “a special sweetness.”Evans was the recipient of a Harvard Dexter Traveling Fellowship and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a treasured member of the Senior Common Room of Harvard’s Leverett House. At the time of his death  he was awaiting the arrival of his last work  an edition of the poems of the Elizabethan writer Robert Parry.He is survived by his loving wife Betty  his son Michael of Chicago and daughter Pamela of Belmont  Mass.  as well as four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.In the words of the Bard  from your family  friends  and admirers: “Good night  sweet prince.”
Divinity School’s Hutchison dies at 75,William Hutchison  scholar of American religious history and former co-master of Winthrop House  died of cancer on Dec. 16  2005  at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He was 75.At the time of his death  Hutchison was the Charles Warren Research Professor of American Religious History at Harvard Divinity School. From 1968 to 2000  he was the Charles Warren Professor of the History of Religion in America.According to David D. Hall  the John A. Bartlett Professor of New England Church History  “Hutchison approached the history of religion in the United States not as a subject unto itself but as a crucial aspect of our national story. When he wrote about the Transcendentalists and the ‘modernist’ Protestant theologians of the early 20th century  the subjects of his first two books  he did so assuming that theirs were important voices within the broader scope of American intellectual history. Perhaps his major accomplishment was to reclaim the intellectual stature of the liberal and modernist movements within modern Protestantism. Hutchison showed that these movements accomplished broadly constructive goals  including that of advancing social reform. From his perspective the movement became an indispensable element in the making of progressive America.”Born in San Francisco on May 21  1930  Hutchison received a B.A. degree in English and history from Hamilton College in 1951  then earned a second B.A. in modern history from Oxford University in 1953 on a Fulbright Scholarship. He earned a Ph.D. in American history from Yale in 1956.After teaching at Hunter College  American University  and the University of Wisconsin  he joined the faculty of the Harvard Divinity School in 1968. With his wife  Virginia  he was co-master of Winthrop House from 1974 to 1979.Hutchison was the author of significant and influential studies of 19th and 20th century religious history  including “The Transcendentalist Ministers: Church Reform in the New England Renaissance” (1959); “The Modernist Impulse in American Protestantism” (1976)  winner of the National Religious Book Award; “Errand to the World: American Protestant Thought and Foreign Missions” (1993); and “Religious Pluralism in America: The Contentious History of a Founding Ideal” (2003). He was also the editor or co-editor of several important works and the author of numerous articles and reviews.He was a valued teacher and adviser to generations of graduate students  many of whom have become important scholars in their own right. In a 2003 letter nominating Hutchison for the lifetime achievement award of the American Society of Church History (given posthumously Jan. 6)  several of his former students wrote of their mentor:“In an age when freedom of academic thought seems imperiled  WRH personally exemplifies toleration of difference. His students occupy every pocket on the cultural  political  and theological map  and they have published in areas of history far afield from mainline Protestantism. No one who worked with him ever suffered doubt about where WRH himself stood on important issues; at the same time no one ever suffered doubt that they themselves would be judged by any standard except that of scholarly excellence.”Hutchison’s respect for the ideas and opinions of his students characterized his relationship with his children as well  according to his son  Joseph Hutchison  who remembers family trips in which Hutchison took pains to ensure that his children had an opportunity to absorb the cultural riches surrounding them.“We were constantly traveling in the summers to places where he was conducting research. I remember packing everyone into the station wagon or going off on trips to Europe and being presented with art and history in a way that wasn’t pedantic  but merely seeing that we were exposed to the history  art  and architecture of the places we visited  and that helped awaken me to an intellectual life.”Joseph Hutchison also remembers the “dinner seminars” that took place during the family’s evening meal  when the elder Hutchison would officiate at debates on subjects ranging from contemporary politics to English grammar and usage.“His mind was not asleep or exhausted when he came home ” Joseph Hutchison said.Elizabeth  the youngest of Hutchison’s four children  who lived with her parents in Winthrop House for the whole five years they were co-masters  remembers the time as a high point in her father’s life when his roles as a teacher and a family man came together.“That was the height of my father’s involvement with undergraduates  and my parents really enjoyed that time in their lives. They were collaborating on something they were both very good at  working with students. It was like being part of one big extended family with the students  the senior tutors  and the graduate student tutors ” she said.Divinity School Dean William Graham  who served as Winthrop House senior tutor during the time the Hutchisons were House masters  said that Hutchison was “hugely engaged in the life of the House and with individual students ” many of whom remained in touch and continued to visit the Hutchisons years afterward.Graham described Hutchison as “a true citizen of the University ” who successfully presided over Winthrop House during a period of transition when the House system was changing from “a rather immature male world to a more mature integrated world in which women were assuming leadership roles and participating fully in House life.” Graham said he learned a lot from the Hutchisons that proved valuable when he later became master of Currier House.Hutchison leaves his wife  Virginia (Quay); four children  Joseph of Ridgefield  Conn.  Catherine Winnie of Rochester  N.Y.  Margaret of Berkeley  Calif.  and Elizabeth of Albuquerque  N.M.; 10 grandchildren; and a sister  Mary Fletcher of Florida.Memorial services will be held at the Memorial Church  Harvard University  on April 28 at 2 p.m.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the William R. Hutchison Fund  which supports doctoral students in religion at Harvard University. (Checks should be made out to Harvard University  and mailed to the William R. Hutchison Fund  Office of Development and External Relations  Harvard Divinity School  45 Francis Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02138.)
Story Professor of Law Arthur von Mehren dies at 83,Arthur Taylor von Mehren  the Story Professor of Law Emeritus at Harvard Law School (HLS)  died Jan. 18 at the age of 83.In addition to educating thousands of Harvard Law students over the course of a 50-year teaching career  von Mehren was a pioneer in comparative and private international law. He helped to develop new thinking on a range of legal issues including international jurisdictions  commercial arbitration  and comparative constitutional law.“All of us in legal education owe a debt of gratitude to Arthur von Mehren  who was a trailblazer in his field ” said HLS Dean Elena Kagan. “At a time when law schools are increasing their focus on comparative and international law  Arthur’s contributions have provided us with a strong and enduring foundation.”“Arthur von Mehren was a towering figure in the fields of international jurisdiction  choice of laws  comparative law  and international commercial arbitration ” said Peter Murray  the Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Law from Practice  who organized a symposium honoring von Mehren’s career in September 2002. At the two-day event  von Mehren was presented with “Law and Justice in a Multistate World ” a collection of more than 54 articles and essays written by leading academics. Said Murray  “He was one of the last of a generation of legal scholars trained in the immediate aftermath of World War II. His work spanned a time in which Europe arose from the ashes of that conflict to create a new legal and political order  which is still evolving.”During his remarkable career  von Mehren studied law in three countries  taught in nine  and authored more than 200 publications  including 10 books. Murray noted that von Mehren maintained a demanding teaching and research regimen up until the point of his death. His work comparing German and American civil procedure has remained definitive for nearly 50 years.“Arthur von Mehren was a true giant in the area of comparative and international law ” said Lester Kissel Visiting Professor of Law Dan Coquillette  an expert on the history of American legal education. “The leadership and stature he brought to Harvard Law School were extraordinary. He put Harvard on the map globally.”Born on Aug. 10  1922  in Albert Lea  Minn.  von Mehren graduated from Harvard College in 1942 and from Harvard Law School in 1945. In 1946 he was awarded his doctorate in government from Harvard and was appointed assistant professor at HLS. Von Mehren spent the first three years of his more than 50-year career at Harvard Law School in full-time study of Swiss  German  and French law at the University of Zurich and University of Paris. In 1953 he was named a tenured professor of law at Harvard  and in 1976 he assumed the Story Professorship. Since 1991 he had been the Story Professor of Law Emeritus.Von Mehren founded the Joseph Story Fellow program  under which talented young German academics would come to work as his research assistant for one-year periods. The 12 graduates of this program are now members of both German and American law faculties. At the time of his death  the Story Fellow alumni were in the process of preparing a commemorative volume of essays to be published in his honor.A memorial service will be held in his honor later this year.
