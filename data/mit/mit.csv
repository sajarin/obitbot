Professor Emeritus Gordon Pettengill  radio astronomy pioneer  dies at 95,Gordon Hemenway Pettengill ’48  MIT professor emeritus of planetary physics in the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS)  former director of the MIT Center for Space Research  and pioneer in radio astronomy  died peacefully at his home in Concord  Massachusetts  on May 8 of congestive heart failure. He was 95.Pettengill pioneered the use of radar for planetary astronomy applications  making groundbreaking observations of the moon  the inner planets  and other solar system objects. His work was instrumental in the development of multiple NASA missions including the Apollo moon missions and the Mariner 2  Pioneer  and Magellan missions to Venus.“As my predecessor as director of what is now the Kavli Institute  Gordon set an extremely high bar of thoughtful  wise  and calm leadership ” says Claude Canizares  the Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics at MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research  “Always modest and generous with his time and sage advice  Gordon was a model one could only strive to emulate.”Pettengill was born on Feb. 10  1926 in Providence  Rhode Island  and grew up in Dedham  Massachusetts. From a young age  he was drawn to radio and electronic technology  and even began trying to build his own radios from spare parts when he was 6 years old. “By the age of 10  I had an elementary grasp of how radio sets worked  taken from old books I found in the local public library  but it wasn't 'til I was 11 or 12 that I first built a working radio — a simple crystal set ” he wrote in 2005 of his early years. In high school  Pettengill met other radio enthusiasts and became involved in amateur radio broadcasting under the call sign W1OUN. His passion for amateur radio would stick with him even as he rose to prominence as a professional radio astronomer.At 16  Pettengill enrolled at MIT to study physics  but  at 18  he was drafted into the U.S. Army. When World War II ended in 1945  he was stationed in Austria and assigned to the Signal Corps  the Army’s military communications branch. After discharge from the Army  he finished his bachelor’s degree in physics at MIT in 1948. He went on to work at Los Alamos National Laboratory and  in 1955  earned his PhD in high-energy physics from the University of California at Berkeley under Owen Chamberlain  the discoverer of the antiproton.Pettengill returned to MIT just as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Millstone Hill radar was under development — a government-commissioned pre-prototype missile-tracking system designed to be 1 million times more sensitive than traditional radar — and with it made a series of breakthrough observations in the nascent field of radio astronomy. When Millstone went online in 1957  Pettengill used the new technology to detect and track Sputnik 1  making the first radar observations of an Earth satellite without the aid of a transmitted beacon signal. In 1961  he aimed the system toward Venus  whose faint echoes heralded the use of radar to measure interplanetary distances. The results of these early experiments recalibrated the accuracy of the astronomical unit by three orders of magnitude  which proved instrumental in the successful navigation of NASA’s 1962 Mariner 2 mission to Venus.During this time period  he also used Millstone to generate the first two-dimensional radar map of the moon  which was a key advancement in NASA’s planning for the future Apollo landings. Pettengill’s work helped ensure that  according to Harvard University astrophysicist Irwin Shapiro  “the Apollo astronauts would not disappear under a meters-thick layer of dust.”In 1963  Pettengill moved to Ithaca  New York  to become associate director  and later director  of the newly-opened Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico  which was built and operated by Cornell University and which stood for 53 years as the largest single-aperture telescope in the world. Pettengill oversaw the installation of a powerful radar transmitter at the site and used it to correct a long-held misconception about Mercury. For almost a century  scientists had believed that Mercury was locked in a sun-synchronous orbit  spinning just once over the 88 Earth days it takes the tiny planet to orbit the sun. However  Pettengill and colleague Rolf Dyce were able to make radar measurements that revealed the Mercury “day” was  in fact  equivalent to about 59 Earth days  such that it spins three times for every two orbits around the sun. This discovery catalyzed a resurgence in the study of planetary orbital dynamics in the solar system.Upon stepping down as director at Arecibo in 1970  Pettengill returned to MIT as a professor of planetary physics in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (which later became EAPS in 1983)  where he remained until his retirement in 1995. During his tenure at MIT  he also served from 1984 to 1989 as director of MIT’s Center for Space Research  forerunner of the Kavli Institute.While at MIT  he led ground-based microwave studies of the inner solar system using the Arecibo telescope and MIT’s Haystack Observatory  achieving many more breakthrough observations  including describing the surface properties of several asteroids and comet nuclei  detecting radar echoes from as far away as the Galilean moons of Jupiter  and  using the Very Large Array  measuring the microwave brightness of the continents of Venus.In 1977  Pettengill turned his attention to tackling space-based radar mapping. Serving as principal investigator for the radar instrumentation aboard NASA’s Pioneer Venus Orbiter  the mission generated the first near-global topographic map of any planet — better even than the current maps of Earth at the time  as the ocean floors remained largely unmapped. Later  Pettengill reprised this role during the Magellan mission to Venus. The Magellan measurements  taken from 1990-94  resulted in near-photographic quality radar mapping — 98 percent of the surface was imaged at resolutions better than 100 meters per pixel — and remain our most detailed description of the surface and interior of that planet.Pettengill was a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1980  he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study astronomy and astrophysics while on sabbatical at the University of Sydney  Australia  and in 1994 earned the Magellanic Premium from the American Philosophical Society for his work on Venus. He was also recognized on multiple occasions by the American Geophysical Union  including the Fred Whipple Award from the Planetology Section in 1995  and the Charles A. Whitten Medal in 1997.After retiring in 1995 to the woods of Concord  Pettengill pursued his hobbies of bird-watching and ham radio  but retained a lively interest in EAPS and MIT Kavli  and continued research as professor emeritus. Additionally  he continued to serve on several committees for NASA and the NAS. He is survived by his wife  Pamela  his children Mark and Rebecca  two granddaughters  and asteroid 3831 Pettengill.
Professor Emeritus Ernest Cravalho  an expert in thermodynamics and pioneer in thermal fluids education  dies at 82,Ernest “Ernie” Cravalho  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering at MIT  passed away on Tuesday  April 13  at the age of 82. Cravalho served as a member of MIT’s mechanical engineering faculty for 44 years. Along with his many research contributions in the fields of thermodynamics  heat transfer  and bioengineering  Cravalho helped shape MIT’s thermodynamics education into what it is today.Born in San Mateo  California  in 1939  Cravalho earned his bachelor’s degree  master’s degree  and PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. After receiving his doctoral degree in 1967  Cravalho made the move to the East Coast to join MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering as an assistant professor.That same year  Cravalho collaborated with the late Professor Joseph Smith to launch a new thermodynamics course at MIT. The revamped course was in response to Cravalho’s feeling that previously  students hadn’t developed a practical and intuitive understanding of thermodynamics. Later on  Cravalho and Smith would work closely with John Brisson and Gareth McKinley  both professors in mechanical engineering  to develop the core thermal fluids class sequence currently taught to undergraduate students — 2.005 (Thermal-Fluids Engineering I) and 2.006 (Thermal-Fluids Engineering II).As a researcher  Cravalho was recognized as an authority not only in thermodynamics and heat transfer  but also in the cryopreservation of biomaterials and energy conversion. Throughout his career  he published 200 research articles and five books — including “Engineering Thermodynamics” in 1981 — on these topics. He was seen as a pioneer in cryopreservation in particular.Cravalho’s research earned him a number of awards and accolades  including membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  the Institute of Medicine  and the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a founding fellow in the American Institute of Biological and Medical Sciences.Throughout his four decades at MIT  Cravalho served in a number of roles across the Institute. From 1975 to 1977  he was associate dean of the School of Engineering. Immediately afterwards  he joined the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology as associate director until 1982. He was the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and chief of biomedical engineering at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1986 to 1993. He then served as co-director of the MIT’s program in biomedical engineering until 1995.While his roles and responsibilities at MIT continued to grow  Cravalho never lost his dedication to teaching. In 2000  he was named a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow in recognition of his exemplary and sustained contributions to the teaching and education of undergraduates. The following year he received the Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. In honor of his father  also named Ernest  Cravalho established the Ernest Cravalho Award for Outstanding Performance in Thermal Fluids Engineering  given to a mechanical engineering student each year.Contributions may be made in Cravalho’s name to MIT’sDepartment of Mechanical Engineeringor to theBoston Symphony Orchestra.
ChoKyun Rha  professor post-tenure of biomaterials sciences and engineering  dies at 87,ChoKyun Rha ’62  SM ’64  SM ’66  SCD ’67  an MIT professor post-tenure and a groundbreaker in biomaterials science and engineering  died March 2 in Boston. She was 87.The first woman of Asian descent to receive tenure at MIT  Rha held four degrees from the Institute and taught at MIT for more than four decades. Her husband  MIT professor of microbiology Anthony Sinskey ScD ’67  also attended MIT  as did their two sons — Tong-ik Lee Sinskey ’79  SM ’80 and Taeminn Song MBA ’95  who is the director of strategy and strategic initiatives for MIT Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) — and two granddaughters.“MIT is my home ” RhatoldMIT Technology Reviewin 2006. “I absolutely love the Institute and feel obliged to do whatever I can for it  not only because it’s done so much for me  but also because I feel I am part of this great institution.”Rha was born and raised in Seoul  Korea. According to family members  her father was a prominent medical doctor who was a pioneer in anatomy  and she developed an interest early in chemical engineering  food science  and food technologies for the development of new foods  medicines  and chemicals. Rha came to the United States in 1956 with the intention of attending MIT and the idea of learning how to design and produce high-quality baby food for families in South Korea.Rha went on to explore the science of biomaterials and their translation toward clinical use. She leveraged frontier tools of chemistry and biotechnology for the discovery of novel biomolecules and high-resolution molecular structure  function  and bioactivity determination. Her creative passion and perseverance led to the creation of several biotech companies in the health and wellness platforms. After helping to start the biopolymer program at biotechnology firm Genzyme  she traveled to Malaysia  Thailand  the Philippines  and Australia  deciding to work on biotechnology projects with Malaysia because of its biodiversity  expertise in plantation sciences  and its educational system. Rha formed and was the principal investigator for the Malaysia-MIT Biotechnology Partnership Program  which involved several Malaysian research institutions and MIT.Her research with undergraduate students  graduate students  and postdocs led to technologies that were foundational to the development of several biotechnology and food science organizations and to her publishing more than 200 papers. Rha held more than 20 patents. She was also a founding member of Women’s World Banking  which provides support to microfinance institutions that offer credit to low-income entrepreneurs in the developing world  especially women.Throughout her career  Rha was known as a compelling colleague and educator and a generous mentor. Many condolence notes sent to her husband and family from all over the world included acknowledgements of her intellectual influence  as well as fond remembrances of the many parties  dinners  and culinary adventures she hosted or organized — often to celebrate the accomplishments of her students  colleagues  and friends.“Professor Rha was an amazing mentor ” says Anushree Subramaniam ’10  a former MIT student who worked in Rha’s Biomaterials Science and Engineering Lab. “She was an ‘ideas person’ and would encourage me to dream big and to strive to do work that would change the world. I never had an interaction with Professor Rha where I did not come away enriched and having learned something. Once you met her  you were immediately engulfed by the warmth of her personality  her unparalleled intellectual prowess  and her iconic style.”Many photos posted online as a memorial showed Rha with students  colleagues  her family  and her husband  who was “her confidant  colleague  supporter  and lifelong partner ” according to Rha’s granddaughter  Deborah Jiehyun Song.Rha established a gift annuity in 2006 whose ultimate purpose was updated in 2019 to provide financial support for graduate students in the Department of Biology  with preference for students interested in microbiology.As Song wrote in a tribute to her grandmother  “she will be forever missed and remembered as a bright soul that strove to change the world for the better with her steadfastness  style  spirit  and smarts.”In addition to her husband and two sons  Rha is survived by her daughter-in-law  Hyunmee Elaine Song  and five grandchildren  and she was a sister to WanKyun Kim  ChungKyun Kim  HwaKyun Cha  SooKyun Rha  the late SungKyun Rha  TaeKyun Rha  and YoungKyun Rha. Rha’s family will host a memorial in October. Gifts in Rha’s memory can be made to theChoKyun Rha (1962) and Anthony J Sinskey (1967) Fund.
Celebrating the life of undergraduate Sergio Dominguez,MIT junior Sergio Dominguez “so loved learning ” says his sister Laura  that he insisted on entering elementary school a full year early. “He loved to learn new things and would spend so much time reading ” often pulling out a random encyclopedia volume and just digging in  she recalls.Dominguez  a Course 6-9 (Computation and Cognition) major at MIT who lived in New House and later resided on East Campus  died suddenly last September. A native of El Paso  Texas  the Gates Millennium Scholar had a penchant for a wide range of intellectual pursuits  from philosophy to religion to the Japanese language. In a word  he was voracious.“He taught me the value of dedication and perseverance ” says Aaron Aceves  a close friend from high school. “Sergio once told me you are the average of the five people you interact with the most. I am beyond honored he was one of them.”Janae Rodriguez  who marched with him in their high school band drum line  added  “He was always so much full of hype. Whenever he saw that any of us down  he was there to lift us up.”Appropriately  Dominguez’s admired the Marvel comic book and movie character Tony Stark  who would don his metal Iron Man suit and take flight to protect the world. “He wanted to attend MIT just like his hero did. I was super proud when he was accepted ” says friend Steve Flores.Dominguez found community at MIT even before his first year started. He joined the Office of Minority Education’s (OME) Interphase EDGE 2016 cohort in the late summer. Lilen Uchima  assistant dean for academic excellence and professional development at OME  recalls meeting him then.“I was lucky to be Sergio’s Interphase EDGE advisor for his first year at MIT ” she says. “Sergio had an inquisitive mind and a true passion for learning. He could chat about anything and was fascinated by all kinds of subjects and topics. We would take advantage of our check-ins to practice our Spanish and share our experiences growing up in a Latino household. He loved music and playing drums. I will miss him dearly.”Dominguez also sought out a MISTI Mexico experience in 2017  to further explore his own and the region’s culture  language  and people. One could say he took a grassroots approach to anthropology  with a keen interest in understanding everything that made humans tick  collectively and individually.Gloria Chry ’20  who also met Dominguez through EDGE  says  “Sergio was always a very respectful and contemplative person. He often spoke about his thoughts on reasons for the universe  how and why things happen  and he always had an innate curiosity about how other people would think. He loved to have fun with others and would be down to try any new thing  whether it be going someplace we've never been or experimenting with new recipes for dinner.”The “joy of being part of a cook-crew schedule in La Casa” together  Chry notes  was in large part because of how Sergio would uncover secret ingredients. “I remember Thursdays fondly as a time when we could have a bit of calm together. Some people might think that four students huddled together in a large dining room on a cold  wintry night is a sad scene  but the laughter and care that was in the room with Sergio made it one of my favorite memories of our first year at MIT.”Miri Skolnik  an assistant dean in Student Support Services  also picked up on Dominguez’s sense of adventure and pursuit of the unexpected  especially with the aim of inspiring and delighting his peers and mentors. “Sergio was deeply interested in the human mind and all its expressions  both his own and those of others ” she says. “In explaining his many insights and new discoveries with others  Sergio was exceptionally humble and modest in sharing his knowledge. Sergio was very attuned to the needs of whomever was listening to him  perceptively tuning into others to make sure that they too felt comfortable  heard  and understood.”He was at once grounded and astute  but no less exuberant and imaginative than the source of one of his favorite quotes  the fictional Don Quixote. The quote  “Confía en el tiempo  que suele dar dulces salidas a muchas amargas dificultades ” roughly translates to “Trust time; it usually provides a sweet way out of many bitter challenges.”Dominguez’s time at MIT was indeed sweet. “He loved MIT. He bought himself his class ring and would wear it with such joy and pride ” says his sister  the same as his icon Tony Stark did on the big screen.
Lidia Vasconcelos  Division of Comparative Medicine staffer  dies at age 53,Lidia Vasconcelos  an area supervisor in the MIT Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM)  died of cancer on Jan. 29. She was 53 years old.“Lidia’s captivating smile displayed her warmth and love for her family  friends  and DCM co-workers ” says James Fox  director of DCM and professor in the Department of Biological Engineering.Vasconcelos joined DCM in 1996 and was promoted to area supervisor in 2004. In this role  she worked with a large team to consistently maintain immaculate  state-of-the-art animal facilities  and provided guidance and support to DCM’s 90 animal care technicians and many active researchers.Vasconcelos’s specific area was the Whitehead Institute animal facility  which has 10 labs and approximately 50 active researchers. “Lidia’s work ethic and professional demeanor made her an extremely valuable asset to all of her DCM colleagues ” says Keith Kun  administrative officer in DCM and one of Vasconcelos’ supervisors. Her work ensured the smooth operation of the facility  from maintaining supplies to direct supervision of 12 animal-care technicians to training new technicians and assistant area supervisors.“Lidia was always a dedicated colleague and friend  and she set an example for all to follow. She cared deeply for the welfare of animals under her care. She was always mindful of her co-workers’ morale and well-being  and a staunch advocate for a workplace which promoted inclusiveness and mutual respect ” says Fox.Vasconcelos is survived by her husband  Paul Vasconcelos  and her children  Kyle and Kayla.
Institute Professor Emeritus Isadore Singer  renowned mathematician who united math and physics  dies at 96,Institute Professor Emeritus Isadore M. Singer  an enormously influential figure in 20th-century science whose work united mathematics and physics  died on Feb. 11. He was 96.In a career that spanned more than 50 years  Singer not only profoundly affected the development of mathematics  but discovered connections between math and physics that led to the creation of a new field  index theory. Singer was the recipient of numerous awards and honors for his pioneering work  including the National Medal of Science and the Abel Prize  often considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics.Among his greatest achievements  Singer and Richard Kadison formulated the Kadison-Singer Conjecture in 1959 as part of their work on formalizing the foundations of English physicist Paul Dirac’s quantum mechanics. It was later found to be equivalent to key problems in applied mathematics  engineering  and theoretical computer science and was proved only in 2013  more than half a century years after it was initially posed.In 1963  Singer and Michael Atiyah hit upon an even more profound connection with the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem. This theorem deeply and irrecoverably tied together the mathematical fields of analysis  geometry  topology. A key part of their work was Singer’s rediscovery and generalization of the Dirac operator  fundamental to the understanding of the quantum theory of the electron. The newly generalized Dirac operator unlocked deep mysteries in mathematics  setting mathematics and physics on a collision course that continues to play out to this day.Since first arriving at MIT in 1950  Singer always credited the Institute for giving him the freedom to pursue that interdisciplinary research. For years  his well-known weekly physics-mathematics seminar served as a hotbed for new ideas  inspiring new collaborations between mathematicians and physicists.His success was all the more remarkable because of his humble beginnings. Born May 3  1924  to Polish immigrants  Singer grew up in Detroit during the Great Depression in a household where money was tight. His father was a printer and his mother was a seamstress; his younger brother  Sidney Singer  would later become a particle physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.Singer attended the University of Michigan on a scholarship  where he worked in Professor Harrison Randall’s spectroscopy lab. He often recalled how he sold the weekly football tickets that Michigan students were given to pay for his food. After graduation  he served as a Signal Corps lieutenant in the Philippines  before attending graduate school.Singer’s drive for understanding physics through mathematics was already formed by this time. “My inclination toward intellectual pursuits was encouraged by my English and chemistry teachers in Central High School  Detroit. I majored in physics at the University of Michigan (1941-1944) but regret not availing myself of their marvelous mathematics department ” Singer said in a lecture at the Smithsonian in 1979. “Puzzled by both relativity and quantum mechanics  I tried to master both these subjects while serving in the U.S. Army. Having failed  I concluded I needed a year of mathematics before I returned to physics  and I became a graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1947. That [one] year stretched to a [lifetime].”Singer graduated from the University of Chicago with both a master’s (1948) and doctorate (1950) in mathematics  studying under Irving Segal. He later attributed his strong background in analysis to Segal’s instruction. During Singer’s final graduate year  mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern arrived from Europe to introduce American scholars to the latest advances in geometry. Singer took notes from Chern’s class that were to prove critical to developing his research program in differential geometry at MIT.
George Shultz PhD ’49  renowned statesman and former professor  dies at 100,George P. Shultz PhD ’49  former U.S. secretary of labor  state  and of the treasury  died peacefully at his home on Feb. 6  at the age of 100. A champion of bipartisanship who for decades urged action on climate change  he leaves a rich legacy forged during more than 70 years of leadership in government  academia  and business.“A beloved teacher  a brilliant scholar  a visionary leader  a public servant of the highest integrity  and a relentless champion for the breakthrough energy technologies on which the future of our society depends  George Shultz represented the very best of MIT and of our nation ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “We will remember Secretary Shultz for the boundless energy  piercing clarity  and innovative ideas he brought to every role and every conversation. And we are profoundly grateful for the eloquence of his example: a life lived in service to the common good.”Born in New York City on Dec. 13  1920  Shultz grew up in Englewood  New Jersey. He graduated from Princeton University in 1942. He was admitted to MIT for a master’s degree program and planned to enroll in 1943  but paused his academic pursuits to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. He served from 1942 to 1945  rising to the rank of captain.Following his military service  Shultz began what would become more than a decade of scholarship and teaching at MIT. After earning his PhD in industrial economics  he taught economics at the Institute in the Department of Economics and at the Sloan School of Management  first as an assistant professor  then as an associate professor.“George and I were assistant professors together. That was seventy years ago ” says Robert M. Solow  a professor emeritus of economics. “We remained friends ever after. Even once he got used to being in high office  there was always a bit of that young researcher in him. I can remember his going door-to-door in Nashua  New Hampshire  learning about the lives of the unemployed. Everyone will miss him.”In 1955  he took a leave of absence from MIT to serve as a senior staff economist on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Advisers. From 1957 to 1968  he served at University of Chicago Graduate School of Business as a professor of industrial relations and then as the school’s dean.He was appointed U.S. secretary of labor under President Richard Nixon in 1969; in this role  he prioritized reduction of poverty and equal employment opportunities  among other initiatives. In 1970  he became the first director of the Office of Management and Budget  a Cabinet-level office  where he worked to advance school desegregation efforts. He then served as U.S. secretary of the treasury  where he co-founded the international organization that later became known as the Group of Seven (G7) nations  formed to pursue shared economic objectives. Shultz served as chairman of the President’s Economic Policy Advisory Board from 1981 to 1982. In the private sector  he held executive roles at Bechtel Group  Inc  from 1974 to 1982.He is perhaps best known for his tenure as U.S. secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan  from 1982 to 1989. Shultz was a key figure in facilitating de-escalation of tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union  helping to draft agreements that led to the end of the Cold War. In 1989  he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the nation’s highest civilian honor. From 1989 until his death  he was a distinguished fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.Shultz’s affiliation with MIT remained strong over the years. When accepting the Robert A. Muh Award for noteworthy achievement in the humanities  arts  and social sciences at MIT in 2003  Shultz gave atalk on national security. He asserted that “as a country  we need to do things that are broadly beneficial to the world.”This philosophy extended to topics including climate change and the transition to low-carbon energy. In recent decades  Shultz became an outspoken advocate for farsighted action to address climate change. Heurged the U.S. to cut its dependence on oilin favor of clean energy production  championedsustained federal support for basic research and built bipartisan support for arevenue-neutral carbon tax proposal— ideas he advocated publicly and discussed over the years with the MIT community.In 2007  as the Institute was launching the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI)  he became the inaugural chair of itsExternal Advisory Board  a leadership role he held until 2019  when he chose to step down as chair. He remained a member of the board until his death  working closely with his successor and longtime friend Norman Augustine.“George inspired those of us working on clean energy and climate change. It was a pleasant surprise when he agreed to be the inaugural chair of the MIT Energy Initiative’s External Advisory Board and  because of his enthusiasm  we didn’t need a second chair for a dozen years!” says Ernest J. Moniz  professor emeritus of physics post-tenure  thirteenth U.S. secretary of energy  and the founding director of MITEI. “I am deeply saddened by the loss of this remarkable statesman and friend.”“Secretary Shultz was generous with his time  his wisdom  and his friendships  creating critically needed communities of shared concern — which he recognized was the way to get things done  and to have lots of fun doing so ” says MIT President Emerita Susan Hockfield. “As founding chair of the External Advisory Board of MIT’s Energy Initiative  Secretary Shultz integrated the insights of industry with the ambitions of the academy  to apply lab-based discoveries to the pressing problem of climate change. He made MITEI and MIT better  and we all enjoyed every minute of the time he shared with us.”“George taught us much about the importance of a principled vision coupled with persistence in engaging with government on the energy and climate challenge ” says MITEI Director Robert C. Armstrong. “He also reminded us to focus on the hard problems like energy in the developing world — which led to our launch of the Tata Center for Technology and Design and other initiatives since then. We will miss him and his guidance greatly here at MITEI.”“George Shultz is the iconic example of the contributions MIT individuals make to the country. We should honor his memory by producing many more.” says John Deutch  Institute Professor Emeritus and former U.S. director of Central Intelligence who held numerous leadership positions in the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Energy.Christopher Knittel  the George P. Shultz Professor of Applied Economics at the Sloan School  says  “It is a tremendous honor to hold the George P. Shultz chair  and I feel privileged to have known George  whose wit  wisdom  and statesmanship were unmatched and irreplaceable. I will miss our conversations spanning climate policy to mainstream economics research. Rest in peace  Secretary Shultz.”Shultz authored numerous books and articles  including “Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State” (1993)  “Learning from Experience” (2016)  and “Thinking about the Future” (2019). He was an editor of “Beyond Disruption: Technology’s Challenge to Governance” (2018). His most recent book  “Hinge of History: Governance in an Emerging New World ” was published in November 2020.Shultz’s remarkable life was built on the foundation of two long marriages. He and his first wife  Lieutenant Helena “O’Bie” O’Brien  a military nurse  met while stationed in Hawaii during the war. The couple raised five children together and were married until her death in 1995. He later married Charlotte Mailliard Swig  the City of San Francisco’s chief of protocol; they were married for 23 years until his death. In addition to Swig  his survivors include his children  11 grandchildren  and nine great-grandchildren.He will be deeply missed by his family  colleagues  students  and friends around the world  many of whom shared warm wishes virtually for his100th birthday celebrationin December 2020. To mark the occasion  Shultzwrote inThe Washington Postabout 10 things he’d learned about trust in his 100 years  underscoring the importance of developing  maintaining  and rebuilding our trust in each other. “Trust is fundamental  reciprocal and  ideally  pervasive. If it is present  anything is possible. If it is absent  nothing is possible ” he wrote.
Professor Emeritus Peter Eagleson  pioneering hydrologist  dies at 92,MIT Professor Emeritus Peter S. Eagleson  an accomplished and influential hydrologist who helped revolutionize the field  died of natural causes on Jan. 6 at the age of 92.Eagleson started working at MIT in 1952 and served as the head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from 1970 to 1975. He was a pioneer in the field of hydrology  transforming it from an engineering specialty with local application into the global-scale study of the water cycle.His 1970 book  titled “Dynamic Hydrology ” provided a radically new perspective on the movement and storage of water in the environment. The water cycle interface with the climate system and biogeochemical cycles and its interactions with the biosphere were hallmarks of his new vision.In a series of seven papers under the main title “Climate  Soil  and Vegetation” in a single issue ofWater Resources Research— the main journal of the discipline — he demonstrated the potential of this new thinking for solving some of the longstanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary challenges.In 1991  Eagleson served as committee chair for the National Research Council  which published “Opportunities in the Hydrologic Sciences.” This report recommended a new vision for the field of study that built on his pioneering ideas.MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Dara Entekhabi was one of Eagleson’s students and remembers him fondly as a scientist and mentor.“Peter Eagleson had an enormous impact on hydrology — arguably  he defined modern hydrologic sciences and put into motion the infrastructure to support it ” Entekhabi says. “He was my mentor  one of the few people who welcomed me and then stewarded me to what I am now. I consider him my exemplar for professional and personal conduct.”Eagleson was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 27  1928  and spent his childhood growing up in a suburb of the city. He attended Lehigh University  where he received his bachelor’s degree in 1949  before moving on for his master’s in 1952 and doctorate in 1956  both from MIT.Following his retirement from MIT  Eagleson published two books: “Ecohydrology” in 2002 and “Range and Richness of Vascular Land Plants” in 2009  which ushered in yet another transformation of the discipline by bridging the fields of hydrology and ecology. Eagleson also served as the president of the American Geophysical Unionfrom 1986 to 1988. In 1992  he was honored as the MIT Killian Award lecturer. In 1997  Eagleson was awarded the Stockholm Water Prize.Eagleson led a rich life outside of the academic world as well. Known as “Pete” to his friends  Eagleson was an avid baseball fan and a classic Red Sox diehard.

John Dugundji  professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics  dies at 95,Professor Emeritus John Dugundji died on Dec. 20 due to natural causes at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge  Massachusetts. He was 95.While Dugundji was renowned for his expertise in aeroelasticity  structural dynamics  and composite materials  those who knew him best also admired his deep knowledge and appreciation of poetry  music  history  and the arts. In true MIT spirit  instead of viewing these intellectual pursuits separately  he instead used each to inform the other — like apoem nestled comfortably on a page alongside research figuresin an academic journal or a flute used to demonstrate vibration  connecting music to the basic principles of his work in dynamics.Taken together with his inherent kindness and his dedication to teaching and mentorship  this interplay between humanity and technicality that permeated every facet of his life is what will be remembered most by Dugundji's loved ones  colleagues  students  and friends."John was a different type of MIT faculty; first and foremost  he was just a nice and caring person  and he approached you being a faculty member different than anyone else I ever encountered " says Brian Wardle  professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT  who was not only a faculty colleague of Dugundji  but also a former student of his courses in structural dynamics. "Whether or not your work was directly related to his  you could always count on him for a meaningful technical discussion  and you would see the way he brightened whenever he talked about dynamics that he just really loved it."Born in New York City on Oct. 25  1925  Dugundji earned his undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering from New York University in 1944. Upon graduation  he served with the United States Navy from 1944 until 1946 as an aviation electronic technician's mate  earning an American Theatre Medal and Victory Medal during World War II. He completed his master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics at MIT in 1948. He spent a year working in industry as a research engineer at Grumman Aircraft Company in Bethpage  New York  until he returned to MIT to pursue his doctoral studies in aeronautical and astronautical engineering.Upon receiving his Doctor of Science in aeronautical engineering in 1951  Dugundji returned to industry  working as a dynamics engineer at Republic Aviation Corporation in Farmingdale  New York  until 1956  when MIT called him back again. He officially joined the faculty in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro) in 1957  where he remained until his retirement in 1993.In some of his earliest research contributions  Dugundji did fundamental work developing a model to interpret and normalize panel flutter  affecting the stability of both airplane wings and rockets while interacting with supersonic flow. He would go on to pursue a series of research projects using composite structures and structural mechanics to characterize phenomena like vibration and resonance in nonlinear systems by modeling elastic coupling  which had a wide range of applications  from smokestacks swaying in the wind to spinning mechanical components found in computer hard drives."His work was very elegant in both a theoretical and experimental way put together " says Carlos Cesnik  Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan  who was a former faculty colleague of Dugundji. "And if I were to summarize  he was a giant as a scholar aeroelasticity  nonlinear dynamics  and structural mechanics  and he was also a true gentleman. He has really influenced my life and approach to work."In 2006  Dugundji received the Structures  Structural Dynamics  and Materials (SDM) Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)  recognizing lifetime achievement with significant contributions to the field. He was cited for "seminal research contributions in aeroelasticity  aeroservoelasticity  nonlinear vibrations and composite structures of fixed-wing aircraft  rotorcraft  turbomachinery as well as his distinguished service as inspirational aerospace educator."Indeed  whether he was teaching in a classroom or working with a graduate student on their research thesis  many of his students have shared similar reflections of his infinite patience  energy  and spirit. His academic impact is palpable  evidenced by many of his former students who have become titans in the field in their own right.Even after his retirement in 1993  Dugundji remained an active member of the AeroAstro community  teaching undergraduate courses in structural dynamics  collaborating on research projects  and mentoring graduate students. But Dugundji's dedication to mentorship was not only reserved for students. Dugundji was an advocate for early-career faculty and even arranged regular lunches to help new faculty members build support networks and a sense of community."From early on  John sought me out  took an active interest in my work  and engaged with students in my lab. Very quickly  he essentially became a member of my lab group " says Raúl Radovitzky  professor of aeronautics and astronautics  who joined MIT in 2001. "John was a caring and loving person with such a profound humanity inside him. He was loved and admired by everyone around him  and a very important figure in my career."Dugundji is survived by two children  Elenna Rose Dugundji and Elisa Dugundji Friedman; his former wife and lifelong friend  Wraye Dugundji; and two grandchildren  Alexander John Friedman and Adam Robb Friedman.For his family  their father's favorite poem "Ithaca" by Constantine P. Cavafy  will always have a special meaning  citing the following excerpt Dugundji quoted in his keynote lecture he delivered following his SDM award from the AIAA: "When you start on your journey to Ithaca  then pray that the road is long  full of adventure  full of knowledge. // Ithaca has given you the beautiful voyage. / Without her you would never have taken the road. / But she has nothing more to give you. // And if you find her poor  Ithaca has not defrauded you. // With the great wisdom you have gained  with so much experience  / you must surely have understood by then what Ithacas mean."A memorial service celebrating John Dugundji's life will be hosted in the MIT Chapel at a later date in 2021 (to be determined). At the Dugundji family's request  gifts may be made in his memory to theAeroAstro Graduate Fellowship Fund. Alternatively  checks may be made payable to MIT in memory of John Dugundji to the AeroAstro Graduate Fellowship Fund (account #3290600) and mailed to: Memorial Gifts Office  600 Memorial Drive  W98-500  Cambridge  MA 02139.
Heather Theberge  mechanical engineering staff member  dies at 42,Heather Theberge  an administrative assistant in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering’s undergraduate office  died on Jan. 3 after a brief battle with cancer. She was 42 years old.“This is a heartbreaking loss for our community. Heather greeted everyone who visited our undergraduate office with incredible kindness and was beloved by her colleagues ” says Evelyn Wang  professor of mechanical engineering and department head.Theberge joined MIT in 2012. In her role as administrative assistant  she was instrumental in ensuring that the mechanical engineering undergraduate program ran smoothly. Her caring nature was evident to the many students  staff  and faculty who got to know her over the years.“Heather was such a genuinely warm person. She was always happy to help anyone who walked into the undergraduate office ” says Jared Embelton  academic administrator for the mechanical engineering undergraduate program.For nearly a decade  Theberge helped countless mechanical engineering students pursue their bachelor’s degrees. From organizing first-year advising efforts  to helping students as they embarked on study abroad programs  to handling all logistics for seniors writing a thesis  Theberge assisted students from the beginning of their academic careers through graduation.Theberge’s calming presence also offered students a respite from the stress of their academics. Students would occasionally sit by her desk to quietly complete problem sets or swing by to grab candy and catch up with Theberge and her colleague Ellen Parilla  senior administrative assistant.“You could tell students thought so highly of Heather ” adds Embelton. “She had such a friendly energy that created a truly welcoming environment for them.”Theberge grew up in southern New Hampshire  and pursued her passion for art at the Massachusetts College of Art  where she received her bachelor’s degree. She is survived by her longtime boyfriend Daniel Casey  her sisters Marianne and Michele  her niece Lauren  and her nephew Dominic.Those wishing to honor Theberge and her love of animals are invited to make a donation in her name to the Animal Rescue League of New Hampshire  545 Route 101  Bedford  NH 03110  or atrescueleague.org.
Professor Emeritus Michael Driscoll  leader in nuclear engineering and beloved mentor  dies at 86,Michael J. Driscoll  MIT professor emeritus of nuclear science and engineering (NSE)  recognized for his leadership in research and devotion to mentorship and education  died peacefully on Dec. 31  2020  in Boston. He was 86.Born in Peekskill  New York  in 1934  Driscoll received his BS in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. Soon after graduating he joined the nuclear U.S. Navy and served as a commissioned officer on the USS Nautilus  the world's first operational nuclear-powered submarine. His four years “working for Admiral Rickover as a nuclear propulsion engineer” sparked a lifelong passion for nuclear technology and engineering and inspired his career in research and teaching.Driscoll first came to the MIT Department of Nuclear Engineering (as it was known at that time) as a graduate student in 1962. He earned his doctorate under the supervision of Professor Irving Kaplan and was invited to join the department’s faculty in 1966 by then-department head Manson Benedict.Since then  he supervised more than 230 doctoral  master’s  and engineer’s theses in the department. Driscoll found particular joy in working with undergraduates at MIT through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). A committed and passionate educator  he continued supervising students well past his official retirement in 1989. His well-subscribed classes benefited an even larger number of MIT students.Over seven decades  Driscoll’s research spanned fields such as reactor analysis  thermal and fast reactor engineering  fuel management  and fuel-cycle engineering and analysis  and included uranium extraction from seawater and disposal of high-level waste. His deep intellectual contributions continue to have significant impact today.His work in nuclear waste disposal  which examined the viability of using deep boreholes as an alternative for disposal of spent fuel and/or its reprocessed constituents  took on new importance in the 1990s following the closure of the Yucca Mountain disposal site.Driscoll led projects on thorium-fueled and high-burnup core designs for light-water reactors that would improve the economics and sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle. He also strove to develop a cost-effective  once-through core design for fast reactors that would enable their near-term deployment  and would accelerate the transition to full breeder or burner mode operation.In the early 2000s  Driscoll and his colleagues at MIT pioneered the resurrection and improvement of the supercritical CO2Brayton power cycle — which is projected to both significantly increase thermal efficiency and reduce capital cost compared to the conventional Rankine cycle (a predictive model of steam turbine performance) design for both nuclear and concentrated solar power plants.Driscoll was animated by his work — which he never thought of as work — and his collaborations with his colleagues and students. A quietly warm man  he touched and enriched the lives of a remarkable number of students and colleagues over the years of his dedicated and vastly productive service on the MIT faculty. His MIT colleagues remember him as a kind man and a true gentleman with an insatiable scientific curiosity and an inexhaustibly creative mind.“Mike may have been the finest educator I’ve ever known. He understood what students (and the rest of us) were capable of  and he was so selfless and generous in helping them achieve it. We were incredibly fortunate to have had him in the department for so long ” reflects Richard Lester  former NSE department head. “This is a very sad day. But with time we can also celebrate his legacy.”Driscoll received the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching at MIT in 2001 and the Outstanding Teacher Award from the Nuclear Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education in 1975. His dedication to training young scientists and engineers was recognized in 1982 through the Irwin Sizer Award “For the Most Significant Improvement to MIT Education.” Driscoll’s classic textbook on the linear reactivity model for nuclear fuel management shines for clarity and practical utility  and has been used by generations of nuclear engineers worldwide.An avid follower of baseball  Driscoll admired Ted Williams and was a big Red Sox fan. He enjoyed model ships  the way in which Sherlock Holmes solved problems  and the calm of tending orchids.Driscoll was predeceased by his wife Regina  who worked for Nuclear Reactor Laboratory Director Theos "Tommy" Thompson  and is survived by his son John Driscoll ’90  of Washington.Donations in Driscoll’s memory can be made to theMichael J. Driscoll (1964) Fund. NSE will hold a memorial service when the community is able to come together in person.
Professor Emerita Judith Jarvis Thomson  highly influential philosopher  dies at 91 ,Professor Emerita Judith Jarvis Thomson  a philosopher of morality and metaphysics  died on Nov. 20 at her home in Cambridge  Massachusetts. She was 91.Thomson transformed the philosophical discussion of abortion with her 1971 article “A Defense of Abortion” and devised thestandard form of the “trolley problem.”Thomson was a faculty member at MIT for 40 years  retiring in 2004. She remained active in philosophy at MIT  writing articles and advising graduate students  until her death.Role modelIn 2012 Thomson was awarded the American Philosophical Association’s prestigious Quinn Prize for her “service to philosophy and philosophers.” The then-chair of the MIT Philosophy Section  Richard Holton  says that “she has had an enormous influence on fellow faculty and on generations of graduate students who now populate the philosophy departments of the English-speaking world. Few of us ever meet Judy’s standards ” he continues  “but  insofar as we do  it is often thanks to the mere thought of what Judy would say.”Thomson’s colleague Sally Haslanger  the Ford Professor of Philosophy at MIT  notes that “she entered the field when only a tiny number of women even considered pursuing a career in philosophy and proved beyond doubt that a woman could meet the highest standards of philosophical excellence … She is the atomic ice-breaker for women in philosophy.”Violinists and trolleysMost of Thomson’s work was in moral philosophy and metaphysics  and often drew connections between these two areas  but she also made contributions to the philosophy of action  the philosophy of mind  the philosophy of science  and the philosophy of language. She published six highly regarded books  including “The Realm of Rights” (1990)  and “Goodness and Advice” (2001)  but what shot her to prominence early on was her 1971 article on abortion  which has been anthologized numerous times and remains a staple of any course in applied ethics.The philosophical debate about abortion had focused on the question of whether a fetus is a person; Thomson argued that even if it is granted that a fetus is a person  abortion is still morally permissible under some circumstances.In a characteristically ingenious thought experiment  she imagines that you have been kidnapped by the Society of Music Lovers  who have plugged a violinist with failing kidneys into your circulatory system; it is the only way of saving the violinist’s life. The violinist is a person  and has a right to life; nevertheless  Thomson says  it is morally permissible for you to unplug the violinist. “The right to life ” she concludes  “will not serve the opponents of abortion in the very simple and clear way in which they seem to have thought it would.”Another landmark essay was “The Trolley Problem ” which appeared in theYale Law Journalin 1985  a sequel to her 1976 essay “Killing  Letting Die  and the Trolley Problem.” Thomson made two crucial amendments to a thought experiment devised by the philosopher Phillipa Foot: The driver of a runaway trolley whose brakes have failed is faced with the choice of whether to turn the trolley onto a side track  in which case it will hit and kill one worker  or not turn  in which case it will kill five workers on the track straight ahead.First  Thomson replaced the trolley driver with a bystander on the side of the track next to a switch: If the bystander leaves the switch alone  the trolley will plow into the five; if the bystander throws the switch  the trolley will move onto the side track  killing one. Second  she contrasted this case with another  where a bystander can bring the trolley to a halt before it kills the five  by pushing a fat man off a footbridge and into the trolley’s path.It seems that a bystander may throw the switch  but not push the fat man  but why? Both cases involve a choice between killing one and letting five die. Thomson’s examples have generated a vast “trolleyology” literature  spanning disciplines including psychology and neuroscience.From Cambridge to CambridgeAfter receiving a BA in philosophy from Barnard College in New York in 1950  Thomson (then Judith Jarvis) went to Newnham College at Cambridge University on a Fulbright Scholarship. The work of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein  who had been a professor at Cambridge until resigning in 1947  had an enormous influence on students there. This was the heyday of so-called “ordinary language” philosophy; philosophical problems were said by Wittgenstein to arise from “the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.”Accordingly  philosophical problems were to be solved — or rather dissolved — by paying careful attention to the use of words. Thomson was especially impressed by John Wisdom  a follower of Wittgenstein and Thomson’s Cambridge supervisor. His papers  she wrote  “are often witty  and they are rich in clever examples” — a characterization that fits Thomson’s own work perfectly. She later came to reject completely Wittgenstein’s view of philosophy  but she retained the idea that philosophers should take careful note of our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking.Years later  Thomson recounted that after not doing well on her final exams  “I concluded that I wasn’t really any good at philosophy.” With her 1952 Cambridge BA (second-class honors)  she was back in New York  writing copy for Fleischmann’s Dry Yeast at the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. But a daytime class in the history of philosophy at Columbia University revived her enthusiasm for the subject and she started her PhD program there  graduating in 1959. During her graduate studies she taught at Barnard College  staying on to become an assistant professor there from 1960 to 1962.In 1962  Thomson left with her husband  the British philosopher James Thomson  to spend a year in Oxford  England. James Thomson was appointed as a professor of philosophy at MIT in 1963  and the couple then moved to Boston. Judith Thomson also joined the Institute as an associate professor in 1964 and was promoted to full professor in 1969. Judith and James Thomson separated in 1976  and were divorced in 1980  but they continued as colleagues until James Thomson's death in 1984.The first MIT philosophy PhD was awarded in 1966  the Philosophy Section became a separate department in 1971  and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy was formed in 1977. From the beginning  Thomson taught  mentored  and supervised generations of graduate students  with her low tolerance for sloppiness and unclarity becoming part of the intellectual fabric of the department.The horizontal lineThomson’s uncompromising style of graduate advising was legendary. Ólafur Páll Jónsson PhD '01  now a professor of philosophy at the University of Iceland  was supervised by Thomson. All of Thomson’s students will recognize their own experience in his description:“I remember going to Judy’s office to discuss a paper I had written for her class early in my first term at MIT. She sorted through a pile of papers on the table  found mine  and handed it to me. On the first page  next to the first paragraph  she had written  in big letters  along the edge of the page: ‘Badly written.’“I was shocked to see this. Whatever my philosophical abilities  I thought of myself as a good writer and there I had it  right to my face  without any filter: ‘Badly written.’ And then she would say: ‘Ólafur  this is very badly written ’ as if the notes on the page were not clear enough. Then she explained to me what was so bad about my writing and she was absolutely right. The text was very badly written. Next time I handed in a paper  I tried to do a better job.“Sometimes she liked what I wrote  I would even get a ‘Superb!’ once or twice  but I would also get the thick black horizontal line and the comment: ‘I don’t understand anything that is below this line.’ The horizontal line was something we  the philosophy students at MIT  knew either by direct acquaintance or by description: Most of us who wrote papers for Judy got it at one point or another  some even on the first page of a paper.”Service and honorsThomson worked to support the philosophy profession in the United States and academia more broadly. She served as the president of the American Philosophical Association’s Eastern Division in 1992-93  and chair of the APA’s Board of Officers from 2002 to 2005. She was heavily involved in policy about academic freedom for the American Association of University Professors.Thomson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1989  elected as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2016  and held the Laurance S. Rockefeller Chair at MIT from 1991 to 1996. A Festschrift  “Fact and Value: Essays on Ethics and Metaphysics for Judith Jarvis Thomson ” was published in 2001. Her many invited lectures include the Tanner Lectures at Princeton University in 1999 and the APA’s Carus Lectures in 2003. She was a visitor at the Australian National University  the University of Pittsburgh  Berkeley Law School  Yale Law School  the University of California at Los Angeles  and finally at Princeton University in 2010. That year a conference was held at MIT to mark the publication of “Normativity ” a book based on her Carus Lectures. She received an honorary degree from Cambridge University in 2015  and an honorary degree from Harvard University the following year.Judith Jarvis Thomson is survived by nieces and nephews Pamela Jarvis  Peter Jarvis  Nedra Hecker  and Alexander Foster. She was buried on Dec. 2 alongside James Thomson in Mount Auburn Cemetery  in Cambridge  Massachusetts.Written by Professor Alex Byrne  head  Department of Linguistics and Philosophy  and head of the MIT Philosophy section; with contributions from Liz Harman  Sally Haslanger  Richard Holton  Carole Hooven  Pam Jarvis  Peter Jarvis  and Rae Langton; prepared for publication by MIT SHASS Communications  Office of Dean Nobles
Mary Frances Wagley  dedicated educator and the first woman to join the MIT Corporation  dies at 93,Mary Frances Wagley ’47  a trailblazer for women and a lifelong educator  died Nov. 1 at her home in Cockeysville  Maryland. She was 93.Having attended MIT at a time when there were few female students — only 12 in her class — Wagley became the first woman to be an MIT Corporation member and the first woman to serve as president of the MIT Alumni Association.“Mary Frances Wagley was a force for a better world and a pioneer for women in science and technology. She set an example with both her intellect and her leadership across an inspiring and impactful life. Everyone at MIT is fortunate to be benefitting from her path-breaking footsteps ” says MIT Corporation Chair Diane Greene  who is the first woman to serve in this role.Wagley was born in New York City to Caroline and James Cash Penney  the founder of JC Penney. She grew up in White Plains on a small farm  often working outdoors with her father or riding her horse. Her skill as an equestrienne brought her as far as Madison Square Garden  where she competed at the National Horse Show.Applying to MIT  one of the deans tried in an interview to talk her out of attending  saying he was sure she wouldn’t like it  Wagley told “MIT Infinite History” in 2009.“Well  I proved him wrong ” Wagley told the interviewer. “I was happy from the moment I stepped foot in the Institute. … I was just ready to soak up all I could learn  and from the day I walked in those doors at 77 Mass. Avenue  it just seemed to me this is the place I belong.”
Julian Beinart: A life of carefully chosen words,Professor Emeritus Julian Beinart  an internationally celebrated architect and longtime MIT professor known for his highly influential course on urbanism  died on Oct. 2 due to complications from Parkinson’s disease. He was 88.“Julian Beinart’s best ideals were the best ideals of this department ” says Nicholas de Monchaux  head of the MIT Department of Architecture. “A tireless student of form  he believed architecture’s role in the city also made it inextricable from politics. His legacy — in South Africa  the U.S.  and beyond — also reminds us that the professional obligation of architects to the city stands alongside the civic demands on every one of us  architect or not.”“Julian’s strengths came from an old-school faith ” says Arindam Dutta  professor of architectural history at MIT. “He believed cities were somehow designed artifacts  and in being so  they could be designed better. It was his task to train designers for this job.”A stranger in a strange landBorn in South Africa to immigrant Jewish parents from Lithuania  Julian Beinart grew up in a small rural town about 40 miles north of Cape Town. A gifted student  he entered the University of Cape Town at age 16. In 1955 he came to MIT where he studied with György Kepes  Louis Kahn  and Kevin Lynch on his way to a master’s degree. He also earned a master’s at Yale University.Returning to South Africa in the early 1960s  Beinart applied the skills he’d acquired at MIT to the emerging African reality. He staged a series of design workshops in five African countries  engaging the visual language of their transition from colonialism to genuine independence. He collected and wrote about African popular art and even produced recordings for South African jazz musicians. And he taught  first at Johannesburg’s Witwatersrand University  and later at the University of Cape Town  where he became dean of the faculty of architecture.While working in the segregated Johannesburg townships that would later be known as SOWETO  Beinart marveled at the way Black African tenants tapped into a communal visual language to transform their bland government-issued apartments into rich and expressive homes. “They had something that professionals who designed housing could not access ” he would later write about the experience.Beinart was deeply invested in the fight against apartheid  South Africa’s brutal system of racial segregation. His anti-apartheid activities soon drew government surveillance and several anonymous threats that made life uncomfortable  and even dangerous. In 1970  he and his wife emigrated to the United States  coming to MIT as heads of house at Burton House  where both their children were born and spent much of their childhood.“I think MIT was an ideal environment for my father ” says his son  the journalist Peter Beinart. “It was cosmopolitan and represented an escape from the parochialism of apartheid South Africa. It was full of brilliant people. And it was full of immigrants  something which resonated deeply with him as the son of immigrants and an immigrant himself.”Finding the soul of the cityIn 1977  Beinart began teaching “The Theory of City Form ” a multidisciplinary course on urban history and design first launched by Kevin Lynch in the mid-1950s. He would teach that course until he retired from MIT in 2013.“The classes were performances ” says Lawrence Vale  an alumnus of Beinart’s course and today associate dean and Ford Professor of Urban Design and Planning at MIT. “A staged dialogue between an orator and the pairs of images he scrolled through and interrogated. The classes inspired myriad topics for future theses and dissertations.”Hundreds of MIT students took “The Theory of City Form” with Beinart. “Julian’s course enabled me to drop in anywhere in the world and get an intelligent read on a city within 24 hours of my arrival ” says course alumnus Isaac Manning SMArchS ’90  an international real estate developer who joined 50 course alumni from all parts of the world to attend Beinart’s final session in 2013. “Taking his class gave me the vocabulary for doing that  and its teachings are applicable to all the challenges we face today.”In 1984  Beinart founded Cambridge International Design Associates. He consulted on urban plans in countries including Malaysia  Russia  and the United States. He worked closely with Teddy Kollek  the mayor of Jerusalem  on multiple projects in Israel and  following the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords  collaborated on development projects with the Palestinian Authority and with leaders in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. From 2001 to 2005  he was in partnership with Indian architect Charles Correa MA ’55 on the design of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Building at MIT.He spoke with his eyesFriends  colleagues  and family remember Beinart as an avid intellect who sought substance in nearly every conversation and exchange. “He was not afraid of silences ” recalls son Peter. “Including awkward silences. That could make a few people uncomfortable. But it also meant that if you had an interaction with him  that interaction would be meaningful.”“He had that very rare combination of intellectual curiosity  generosity  clarity  and passion ” says Hashim Sarkis  dean of the School of Architecture and Planning.Nader Tehrani  who headed the MIT Department of Architecture from 2010 through 2014  says Beinart treated him like a son from the moment he arrived at MIT. “When I became chair  he never patronized me. But he let me know  almost wordlessly  that he was there if I ever needed advice. Which was fortunate  because I needed a lot.”Those closest to him describe how Beinart  while also a gifted writer  perceived and communicated most naturally on a visual level. “So much of my whole childhood was spent drawing with him  often in his MIT office ” says daughter Jeannie Beinart Stern  also a designer. “We would pass a piece of paper back and forth between us  each of us adding a line or dot or squiggle. Each seeing new possibilities in each other’s forms. More than in any other way  my father spoke with his eyes.”Beinart believed that to really understand a city and its spaces one must experience it. “Early in his career  Julian spent several months in Assisi  studying the Italian hilltop town ” says Cara McCarty  curator emerita at Cooper Hewitt  Smithsonian Design Museum in New York  and Beinart’s longtime companion. “He hand-measured and mapped every building. He believed that measuring and drawing something were necessary steps on the way to changing it.”A secret passionPensive  quiet  and sometimes withdrawn  Beinart was a passionate sports fan. He loved cricket and once traveled with son Peter to watch South Africa compete in the Bahamas. He was also a devoted fan of Boston’s Red Sox  Celtics  and Patriots. “Julian loved watching people excel ” says McCarty. “Whether intellectually  creatively  or on the playing field. He loved seeing people make the most of their abilities.”The family has encouraged donations to thestudent research fundestablished in his memory.Beinart's friends and family will celebrate his life and career on Sunday  Nov. 8  at 1 p.m. EST. This openvirtual eventwill feature remarks from MIT friends  colleagues  and former students across multiple generations.
Angelika Amon  cell biologist who pioneered research on chromosome imbalance  dies at 53,Angelika Amon  professor of biology and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research  died on Oct. 29 at age 53  following a two-and-a-half-year battle with ovarian cancer."Known for her piercing scientific insight and infectious enthusiasm for the deepest questions of science  Professor Amon built an extraordinary career – and in the process  a devoted community of colleagues  students and friends " MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the MIT community.“Angelika was a force of nature and a highly valued member of our community ” reflects Tyler Jacks  the David H. Koch Professor of Biology at MIT and director of the Koch Institute. “Her intellect and wit were equally sharp  and she brought unmatched passion to everything she did. Through her groundbreaking research  her mentorship of so many  her teaching  and a host of other contributions  Angelika has made an incredible impact on the world — one that will last long into the future.”A pioneer in cell biologyFrom the earliest stages of her career  Amon made profound contributions to our understanding of the fundamental biology of the cell  deciphering the regulatory networks that govern cell division and proliferation in yeast  mice  and mammalian organoids  and shedding light on the causes of chromosome mis-segregation and its consequences for human diseases.Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes  but as they divide they can make errors that lead to too many or too few chromosomes  resulting in aneuploidy. Amon’s meticulous and rigorous experiments  first in yeast and then in mammalian cells  helped to uncover the biological consequences of having too many chromosomes. Her studies determined that extra chromosomes significantly impact the composition of the cell  causing stress in important processes such as protein folding and metabolism  and leading to additional mistakes that could drive cancer. Although stress resulting from aneuploidy affects cells’ ability to survive and proliferate  cancer cells — which are nearly universally aneuploid — can grow uncontrollably. Amon showed that aneuploidy disrupts cells’ usual error-repair systems  allowing genetic mutations to quickly accumulate.Aneuploidy is usually fatal  but in some instances extra copies of specific chromosomes can lead to conditions such as Down syndrome and developmental disorders including those known as Patau and Edwards syndromes. This led Amon to work to understand how these negative effects result in some of the health problems associated specifically with Down syndrome  such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Her expertise in this area led her to be named co-director of the recently established Alana Down Syndrome Center at MIT.“Angelika’s intellect and research were as astonishing as her bravery and her spirit. Her lab’s fundamental work on aneuploidy was integral to our establishment of the center ” say Li-Huei Tsai  the Picower Professor of Neuroscience and co-director of the Alana Down Syndrome Center. “Her exploration of the myriad consequences of aneuploidy for human health was vitally important and will continue to guide scientific and medical research.”Another major focus of research in the Amon lab has been on the relationship between how cells grow  divide  and age. Among other insights  this work has revealed that once cells reach a certain large size  they lose the ability to proliferate and are unable to reenter the cell cycle. Further  this growth contributes to senescence  an irreversible cell cycle arrest  and tissue aging. In related work  Amon has investigated the relationships between stem cell size  stem cell function  and tissue age. Her lab’s studies have found that in hematopoetic stem cells  small size is important to cells’ ability to function and proliferate — in fact  she posted recent findings onbioRxivearlier this week — and have been examining the same questions in epithelial cells as well.Amon lab experiments delved deep into the mechanics of the biology  trying to understand the mechanisms behind their observations. To support this work  she established research collaborations to leverage approaches and technologies developed by her colleagues at the Koch Institute  including sophisticated intestinal organoid and mouse models developed by the Yilmaz Laboratory  and a microfluidic device developed by the Manalis Laboratory for measuring physical characteristics of single cells.The thrill of discoveryBorn in 1967  Amon grew up in Vienna  Austria  in a family of six. Playing outside all day with her three younger siblings  she developed an early love of biology and animals. She could not remember a time when she was not interested in biology  initially wanting to become a zoologist. But in high school  she saw an old black-and-white film from the 1950s about chromosome segregation  and found the moment that the sister chromatids split apart breathtaking. She knew then that she wanted to study the inner workings of the cell and decided to focus on genetics at the University of Vienna in Austria.After receiving her BS  Amon continued her doctoral work there under Professor Kim Nasmyth at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology  earning her PhD in 1993. From the outset  she made important contributions to the field of cell cycle dynamics. Her work on yeast genetics in the Nasmyth laboratory led to major discoveries about how one stage of the cell cycle sets up for the next  revealing that cyclins  proteins that accumulate within cells as they enter mitosis  must be broken down before cells pass from mitosis to G1  a period of cell growth.Towards the end of her doctorate  Amon became interested in fruitfly genetics and read the work of Ruth Lehmann  then a faculty member at MIT and a member of the Whitehead Institute. Impressed by the elegance of Lehmann’s genetic approach  she applied and was accepted to her lab. In 1994  Amon arrived in the United States  not knowing that it would become her permanent home or that she would eventually become a professor.While Amon’s love affair with fruitfly genetics would prove short  her promise was immediately apparent to Lehmann  now director of the Whitehead Institute. “I will never forget picking Angelika up from the airport when she was flying in from Vienna to join my lab. Despite the long trip  she was just so full of energy  ready to talk science ” says Lehmann. “She had read all the papers in the new field and cut through the results to hit equally on the main points.”But as Amon frequently was fond of saying  “yeast will spoil you.” Lehmann explains that “because they grow so fast and there are so many tools  ‘your brain is the only limitation.’ I tried to convince her of the beauty and advantages of my slower-growing favorite organism. But in the end  yeast won and Angelika went on to establish a remarkable body of work  starting with her many contributions to how cells divide and more recently to discover a cellular aneuploidy program.”In 1996  after Lehmann had left for New York University’s Skirball Institute  Amon was invited to become a Whitehead Fellow  a prestigious program that offers recent PhDs resources and mentorship to undertake their own investigations. Her work on the question of how yeast cells progress through the cell cycle and partition their chromosomes would be instrumental in establishing her as one of the world’s leading geneticists. While at Whitehead  her lab made key findings centered around the role of an enzyme called Cdc14 in prompting cells to exit mitosis  including that the enzyme is sequestered in a cellular compartment called the nucleolus and must be released before the cell can exit.“I was one of those blessed to share with her a ‘eureka moment ’ as she would call it ” says Rosella Visintin  a postdoc in Amon’s lab at the time of the discovery and now an assistant professor at the European School of Molecular Medicine in Milan. “She had so many. Most of us are lucky to get just one  and I was one of the lucky ones. I’ll never forget her smile and scream — neither will the entire Whitehead Institute — when she saw for the first time Cdc14 localization: ‘You did it  you did it  you figured it out!’ Passion  excitement  joy — everything was in that scream.”In 1999  Amon’s work as a Whitehead Fellow earned her a faculty position in the MIT Department of Biology and the MIT Center for Cancer Research  the predecessor to the Koch Institute. A full professor since 2007  she also became the Kathleen and Curtis Marble Professor in Cancer Research  associate director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at MIT  a member of the Ludwig Center for Molecular Oncology at MIT  and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.Her pathbreaking research was recognized by several awards and honors  including the 2003 National Science Foundation Alan T. Waterman Award  the 2007 Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research  the 2008 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Award in Molecular Biology  and the 2013 Ernst Jung Prize for Medicine. In 2019  she won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science  and was named to the Carnegie Corporation of New York’s annual list of Great Immigrants  Great Americans. This year  she was given the Human Frontier Science Program Nakasone Award. She was also a member of the NAS and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Lighting the way forwardAmon’s perseverance  deep curiosity  and enthusiasm for discovery served her well in her roles as teacher  mentor  and colleague. She has worked with many labs across the world and developed a deep network of scientific collaboration and friendships. She was a sought-after speaker for seminars and the many conferences she attended. In over 20 years as a professor at MIT  she has mentored more than 80 postdocs  graduate students  and undergraduates  and received the School of Science’s undergraduate teaching prize.“Angelika was an amazing  energetic  passionate  and creative scientist  an outstanding mentor to many  and an excellent teacher ” says Alan Grossman  the Praecis Professor of Biology and head of MIT’s Department of Biology. “Her impact and legacy will live on and be perpetuated by all those she touched.”“Angelika existed in a league of her own ” explains Kristin Knouse  one of Amon’s former graduate students and a current Whitehead Fellow. “She had the energy and excitement of someone who picked up a pipette for the first time  but the brilliance and wisdom of someone who had been doing it for decades. Her infectious energy and brilliant mind were matched by a boundless heart and tenacious grit. She could glance at any data and immediately deliver a sharp insight that would never have crossed any other mind. Her positive attributes were infectious  and any interaction with her  no matter how transient  assuredly left you feeling better about yourself and your science.”Taking great delight in helping young scientists find their own “eureka moments ” Amon was a fearless advocate for science and the rights of women and minorities and inspired others to fight as well. She was not afraid to speak out in support of the research and causes she believed strongly in. She was a role model for young female scientists and spent countless hours mentoring and guiding them in a male-dominated field. While she graciously accepted awards for women in science  including the Vanderbilt Prize and the Women in Cell Biology Senior Award  she questioned the value of prizes focused on women as women  rather than on their scientific contributions.“Angelika Amon was an inspiring leader ” notes Lehmann  “not only by her trailblazing science but also by her fearlessness to call out sexism and other -isms in our community. Her captivating laugh and unwavering mentorship and guidance will be missed by students and faculty alike. MIT and the science community have lost an exemplary leader  mentor  friend  and mensch.”Amon’s wide-ranging curiosity led her to consider new ideas beyond her own field. In recent years  she has developed a love for dinosaurs and fossils  and often mentioned that she would like to study terraforming  which she considered essential for a human success to life on other planets.“It was always amazing to talk with Angelika about science  because her interests were so deep and so broad  her intellect so sharp  and her enthusiasm so infectious ” remembers Vivian Siegel  a lecturer in the Department of Biology and friend since Amon’s postdoctoral days. “Beyond her own work in the lab  she was fascinated by so many things  including dinosaurs — dreaming of taking her daughters on a dig — lichen  and even life on Mars.”“Angelika was brilliant; she illuminated science and scientists ” says Frank Solomon  professor of biology and member of the Koch Institute. “And she was intense; she warmed the people around her  and expanded what it means to be a friend.”Amon is survived by her husband Johannes Weis  and her daughters Theresa and Clara Weis  and her three siblings and their families.
Institute Professor Emeritus Mario Molina  environmental leader and Nobel laureate  dies at 77,Renowned atmospheric chemist and MIT Institute Professor Emeritus Mario Molina  who discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) had the potential to destroy the ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere  has died at the age of 77.At MIT  Molina held joint appointments in the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) and the Department of Chemistry  from 1989 to 2004.In the early 1970s  Molina demonstrated through computer modeling and laboratory work that compounds widely used in propellants and refrigerants could destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere  increasing the ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth. His theories were later confirmed by observation and helped support the ratification of the Montreal Protocol  the first global treaty to reduce CFC emissions.In 1995  he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with F. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine  and Paul Crutzen  a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz  Germany  for discovering the depletion of the Earth’s thin  protective layer of ozone  which the Nobel committee referred to as the “Achilles heel of the universe.” Molina continued to advocate for environmental causes throughout his career.“Mario Molina was the gentle giant of his age in environmental science  a wise mentor to his students  and respectful of others no matter their rank or status ” says Ronald Prinn  the TEPCO Professor of Atmospheric Science in EAPS  who led the search committee that originally brought Molina to MIT. “We are privileged to have had him on the faculty at MIT for 15 years  during the middle of which he was awarded the Nobel Prize  and from the proceeds of which he established the Molina Fellowships at MIT. His work on mitigating depletion of the ozone layer and air pollution in megacities is legendary. Most recently he founded the Centro Mario Molina devoted to the transition from fossil energy to clean energy in Mexico and beyond. He will be sorely missed  but never forgotten.”Early scientific inquiryBorn on March 19  1943 in Mexico City  Molina was enthralled by science from a young age. He used toy microscopes and chemistry sets to create his own “lab” in the bathroom of his childhood home. His aunt  a chemist  supported these early scientific interests by helping him conduct experiments more advanced than amateur chemistry sets would allow.He attended school in Mexico City; later  his parents sent him abroad to the Institute Rosenberg in Switzerland  hoping to support his scientific proclivity. Molina attended the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)  where he completed his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering in 1965  followed by a postgraduate degree in polymerization kinetics from the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg  West Germany  in 1967. The University of California at Berkeley awarded him a PhD in physical chemistry in 1972.Environmental reactionsIn 1973  Molina began his CFC research as a postdoc at the University of California at Irvine  in the lab of F. Sherwood Rowland  who initially presented Molina with a list of research options. Molina latched quickly to one in particular: tracking the environmental fate of CFCs  the industrial chemicals that had been building up in the atmosphere and at the time were thought to have no adverse effects on the environment.After simulating the chemicals’ reaction behavior and kinetics  Molina found that there was not much that could break down CFCs in the lower atmosphere. He suspected  however  that CFCs could be detrimental at higher altitudes  and hypothesized that high-energy photons from the sun available within the stratosphere could break the chemicals apart  generating free chlorine ions that would then react destructively with ozone molecules. Rowland and Molinapublished their workin the journalNaturein 1974.That year  Molina and Rowland publicly called for a ban on CFCs at the American Chemical Society meeting. Molina also began teaching atmospheric science  holding positions at UC Irvine from 1975 to 1982 and conducting research at Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory from 1982 to 1989. Initially disputed by industry  Molina’s work began to gain traction  first when it was reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences in 1976  and then even more so when a hole in the Antarctic ozone later was first reported in 1985.In 1987  his work  in part  inspired atmospheric chemist Susan Solomon to lead a scientific expedition to Antarctica  the results of which proved that the ozone hole was indeed caused by CFCs. The Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs went into effect in 1989  the same year that Molina joined the faculty at MIT.Molina was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with his colleagues for their work on CFCs and ozone depletion — the first time the Swedish Academy recognized environmental degradation from human-made substances. Molina donated a substantial portion of his share of the prize money to MIT in 1996 to create a fellowship program for scientists from developing countries to pursue environmental research.“It’s clear to me that one of the important needs for global environment issues is the participation of scientists from all over the world ” Molina said in announcing the gift. “We have some very big challenges ahead if we are to preserve the environment  and it's obvious that there are too few scientists from developing countries involved in the effort.”Molina continued his work in atmospheric chemistry while at MIT  studying the atmosphere-biosphere interface  hoping to better understand global climate change.“The signature feature of Mario Molina was that he was not only a great scientist and scholar  he was also a true gentlemen — always ready with a smile and focused on the person he was speaking with  whether it was an undergraduate student or a fellow Nobel laureate ” says Solomon  who is the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies in EAPS and holds a secondary appointment in the Department of Chemistry.“His humanity and his science”In 1994 Molina was named by U.S. President Bill Clinton to serve on the 18-member President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Later  he also served on President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in 2011  and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama in 2016.MIT appointed him an Institute Professor for his abilities as a “natural educator” and excellence in research in 1997.Molina often traveled to Mexico to work on environmental projects. While at MIT  he collaborated with policymakers and researchers to reduce Mexico City’s severe air pollution and improve air quality. In 2004  he founded theMario Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environmentin Mexico City  an organization dedicated to bridging “practical solutions between science and public policy on energy and environment matters to promote sustainable development and vigorous economic growth.” That same year  he left MIT to join the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of California at San Diego. In 2017  he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.“Mario Molina is unique in his ability to span from fundamental science to local and global policy for stewarding our environment. He towers in his humanity as well as his science ” said MIT President Charles M. Vest on Molina’s departure.Molina was awarded numerous honorary degrees from institutions including Harvard University  Duke University  and Yale University  as well as institutions in Mexico. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1993  the United States Institute of Medicine in 1996  and The National College of Mexico in 2003. He was a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)  and served on numerous advisory councils  including the National Science Foundation’s Advisory Committee for Geosciences.In addition to his Nobel Prize  Molina received the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement  the UNEP-Sasakawa Environment Prize  and the United Nations Champion of the Earth Award. He was bestowed the Knight Medal of the Legion of Honor by French President Francois Hollande in 2014. He was awarded the Esselen Award of the Northeast section of the American Chemical Society in 1987  the Newcomb-Cleveland Prize from AAAS in 1988  as well as the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Advancement and the United Nations Environmental Programme Global 500 Award in 1989.Additionally  the Pew Charitable Trusts Scholars Program in Conservation and the Environment honored him as a leading environmental scientist in 1990. Molina was given the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1996. He won the Willard Gibbs Award from the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society and the American Chemical Society Prize for Creative Advances in Environment Technology and Science in 1998. He was granted the 9th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment. He also had an asteroid named after him: 9680 Molina.Molina is survived by his wife  Guadalupe Álvarez; his son  Felipe Jose Molina; and three stepsons  Joshua  Allan  and Asher Ginsburg. He was previously married to atmospheric chemist Luisa Tan Molina  an EAPS research affiliate.
Professor Emeritus Edward Merrill  chemical engineer who helped found the field of bioengineering  dies at 96,Edward W. Merrill  professor emeritus of chemical engineering  died peacefully at his home on Aug. 6 at the age of 96  surrounded by his children and grandchildren.A longtime chemical engineer at MIT  Merrill was a founding contributor to the field of biological engineering. He developed the area of biomaterials and over a 66-year career pioneered several fields of bioengineering.“Ed made an indelible mark on each life he touched  professionally and personally. Not only did his research contributions help better the lives of thousands  but his commitment to education and mentorship helped shape a generation of biomedical engineers ” says Paula Hammond  the David H. Koch (1962) Professor in Engineering and head of the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. “I experienced it first-hand as a student and a co-teacher; he raised the bar for all of us.”Born in New Bedford  Massachusetts  on Aug. 31  1923  Merrill grew up in Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury  Massachusetts  and attended the Roxbury Latin School prior to entering Harvard College in 1941 to study the classics. He received a BA in chemistry from Harvard University in 1944 and pursued doctoral studies at MIT under the direction of Herman P. Meissner. Merrill received his ScD in 1947 working on pioneering theories and experimental studies of polymer adhesion. Upon graduation  he was employed by Dewey and Almy (later part of W.R. Grace) and joined MIT as an assistant professor of chemical engineering in 1950. Merrill was appointed the Carbon P. Dubbs Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1973  a position he held until 1998. Merrill was a visiting lecturer in chemistry at Harvard University from 1952 to 1958  a consultant at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital of Boston from 1960 to 1972  a consultant of the Children's Hospital in Boston from 1969 to 1972  and a consultant of the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston from 1969 to 1985. He has also served as chief scientist and consultant in biochemical engineering to Harvard University Health Services from 1984 to 1998.In the 1950s and '60s  Merrill was the leading scientist in blood rheology. He investigated the effect of the hematocrit  various plasma proteins  and white blood cells on blood viscosity and flow behavior  and he developed appropriate experimental tools for rheological investigations of blood (including the patented GDM [Gilinson-Dauwalter-Merrill] viscometer) under realistic in-vitro conditions. In the 1960s and 1970s  Merrill was a pioneer in the development of the artificial kidney  analysis of its transport characteristics  and optimization of hemodialyzer membranes. In fact  Merrill's pioneering work on artificial kidneys  with Professor Clark Colton PhD ’69 and Robert A. Britton ScD ’67  led to the development of the first National Institutes of Health guidelines for artificial kidneys in the 1960s. In the 1960s  '70s  and '80s  he pioneered the field of protein/polymer interaction under stagnant and flow conditions and made exceptional contributions in the development of hydrogels as biomaterials  and in ionic or covalent heparinization techniques on polymer surfaces for antithrombogenic materials.Merrill and Edward Saltzman of Harvard proposed polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a highly biocompatible material in an influential 1979 paper and did significant studies to analyze its stricture and blood response. Merrill's ideas on PEO as a non-thrombogenic biomaterial led to an explosion in the use of PEG- and PEO-decorated biomedical systems. In 1973  Merrill pioneered silicone-based contact lenses that became the basis of the hard  oxygen-permeable contact lens technology. Merrill's work on highly cross-linked polyethylene in the 1990s with William H. Harris led to the new irradiation-cross-linked  high density polyethylene (HDPE) materials used in artificial joints such as knee and hip replacements.Merrill's contributions in the area of biomedical applications of aerosol engineering were also significant and led to the use of dipalmitoyl-lecithin aerosols for treatment of infants born with hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome). Finally  he made significant and sustained contributions to drag reduction phenomena. Merrill was the inventor of more than 40 U.S. patents and about 230 international patents.“Professor Merrill was probably the premier biomedical engineer of the 20th century ” says Nicholas Peppas ScD ’74  the Cockrell Family Regents Chaired Professor at the University of Texas at Austin and advisee of Merrill  “Not only did he develop the fundamentals of the field  and came up with pioneering inventions of blood flow rheometers  non-thrombogenic biomaterials  advanced contact lenses  treatments of the respiratory distress syndrome  and the most successful materials for joint replacements  but he also became a superb educator and mentor who directed and advised hundreds  if not thousands  of biomedically-oriented students of diverse backgrounds and nationalities.”Merrill personally supervised 57 PhD and 62 MS students  and 12 postdocs in his career. About 35 of these became professors in engineering  sciences  or medicine in academic institutions. About 20 of them became entrepreneurs serving as CEOs or other leaders of the chemical  biomedical or pharmaceutical industries. Merrill and eight of his former students or associates were listed in the 2008 AIChE list of "100 Eminent Chemical Engineers of the Modern Era.” Fifty-five of his academic descendants are members of the major academies now: 28 are National Academy of Engineering (NAE) members  19 are members of the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)  three are National Academy of Sciences (NAS) members  and five are members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS). Many U.S. and international companies have been founded on his pioneering research ideas by his students and others.A superb teacher  Merrill taught courses on polymers  biomaterials  transport phenomena  and medical sciences at MIT. His MIT course entitled “Chemical Engineering in Medicine and Biology ” offered in 1963  was the first such course in the United States. Merrill was a concerned educator and mentor who welcomed in his laboratories numerous scientists from other countries. He had a close association with Paul Rempp of the Macromolecular Center of Strasbourg  France  and in 1991 wrote an impactful book on polymers with him  “Polymer Synthesis.” At that time  he was also a vice-president of the Boston-Strasbourg Sister City Association and a director of the Alliance Française of Boston-Cambridge from 1990-96. He was also consultant to the conservator of the Department of Prints  Drawings  and Photographs at the Museum of Fine Arts  Boston from 1988 to 1998.Merrill was elected a member of the AAAS  the NAE  the NAM  and the National Academy of Inventors. He received the Founders Award of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) in 2000  the Founders Award of the Society for Biomaterials (SFB) in 2003  and the Pierre Galletti Award from the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineers in 2010. AIChE had also bestowed upon him the 1982 Alpha Chi Sigma Award and the 1993 Charles M. A. Stine Award. In 1990  the SFB awarded him the Clemson Award. At its centennial celebration in 2008  AIChE recognized him as one of the “100 Eminent Chemical Engineers of the Modern Era.”Merrill married Genevieve "Ginette" de Bidart on Aug. 19  1948  in Cambridge  Massachusetts. Ginette passed away seven months earlier on Dec. 20  2019. They are survived by their daughter Anne and son Frank Merrill  and their grandchildren: James  Sasha  and Julia Merrill. Merrill took great pride in his two children and three grandchildren and enjoyed the time he spent with them immensely. He was not simply a father and grandfather  but a mentor and inspiration to all who encountered him. His presence and his wisdom will sorely be missed by all whose lives he touched  and he will be greatly missed by his family. The family has already held private services.
Daniel Wang  Institute Professor and pioneer in biochemical engineering  dies at 84,Daniel I.C. Wang  an MIT Institute Professor who was considered one of the founding fathers of the field of biochemical engineering  died Saturday in Cambridge  Massachusetts. He was 84.During his long career at MIT  Wang contributed to many aspects of biochemical engineering — a field that involves genetically engineering microbes and human cells to produce useful proteins. His research spanned all phases of the process  including fermentation  monitoring and control of bioprocesses  enzyme technology  product purification  and protein folding.In 1985  Wang was the driving force behind the launch of MIT’s Biotechnology Process Engineering Center (BPEC)  which was founded as a multidisciplinary research center bringing together faculty from the departments of Biology  Chemistry  and Chemical Engineering.“Danny’s work and impact in the field of biochemical engineering were profound  and led to a major shift in the growth of chemical engineering at the interface with biology ” says Paula T. Hammond  the David H. Koch Professor and head of the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. “He extended chemical engineering concepts to bioreactors and the first efforts in bioprocesses  enzyme technology  and mammalian cell cultures  among many other accomplishments. Chemical engineering has lost a giant  and the department has lost a good friend and incredible mentor to our faculty  researchers  and numerous alumni.”The establishment of MIT’s BPEC coincided with the overall emergence of biotechnology as an industry and a research field. Wang and other early pioneers developed ways to use emerging knowledge about the genetics of microbes to engineer them to produce useful products. Among many other projects  Wang worked on engineeringE. colito increase their production of desired recombinant proteins. He also studied techniques for increasing yields of therapeutic recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies from mammalian cells.He also worked closely with the biotechnology industry and was one of the original members of Biogen’s scientific board  where he was instrumental in the company’s development of the manufacturing of complex biopharmaceuticals.Born in Nanking  China  Wang worked to establish international ties between MIT and universities in other countries  particularly in Asia. He established a joint program in molecular engineering of biological and chemical systems with the National University of Singapore  which became part of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).Wang  who served as the Chevron Professor of Chemical Engineering before being named an Institute Professor  was also known for his dedication to his students. Noubar Afeyan  a former student of Wang’s who is now the CEO of Flagship Pioneering and a member of the MIT Corporation  described him as a friend and cherished mentor.“Danny touched thousands all over the world by inspiring generations of students  industrial collaborators  and fellow professors. He was confident yet humble  tough yet caring  serious yet playful  with an insatiable appetite for good Chinese food. We will miss Danny and work hard to make his legacy proud ” Afeyan says.In recognition of Wang’s pioneering research  MIT’s Frontiers of Biotechnology Lectureship was renamed for him in 2014. Now known as the Daniel I.C. Wang Lecture  the lectureship honors achievements at the frontiers of biotechnology  and the distinguished scientists and engineers responsible for them.“Dan Wang’s influence as a teacher  mentor  researcher  and friend has been monumental to so many people who have become the leaders in building a biotech industry and biochemical engineering as a profession ” says Charles Cooney  the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT. “Though saddened by his passing  we celebrate his legacy of unwavering nurturing of students and colleagues to address challenging problems with innovative solutions.”Wang earned two degrees from MIT — a BS in 1959 and an MS in 1961. In 1963  he earned a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. He joined the MIT faculty in 1965 and was named an Institute Professor  MIT’s highest faculty honor  in 1995. He received numerous honors and awards  including the Amgen Biochemical Engineering Award in 1995 and the William H. Walker Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1994. He was also a member both of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.In 2019  the American Institute of Chemical Engineers established an award in his honor — the D.I.C. Wang Award for Excellence in Biochemical Engineering. The award is given annually and “recognizes individuals for their contributions to the field and to the practice of biochemical engineering through their position in industry or academia as exemplified by Professor Wang in his 50 years of contributions ” according to the AIChE.Wang also contributed to national efforts in biotechnology  as chair of the Membership Committee of the National Academy of Engineering  a member of the National Biotechnology Policy Board at the National Institute of Health  a member of the National Research Council Committee on Bioprocess Engineering  a member of the National Research Council Committee on Biotechnology  and a member of the Board of Biology of the National Research Council.He also co-authored five books  published more than 250 papers  and was awarded 15 patents.Wang is survived by his wife  Victoria; his son  Keith; his daughter-in-law Katherine; his two granddaughters  Veronica and Emily; his sister  Judy  and her family; and his sister-in-law  Cecile. Plans for a memorial will be announced at a later date.
Donald Blackmer  professor emeritus of political science and longtime leader at MIT  dies at 91,Donald L. M. Blackmer  professor emeritus of political science at MIT  died on Aug. 14. He was 91.A highly regarded scholar in international studies  he was also a longtime leader at MIT  serving variously as executive director of the Center for International Studies  head of the Department of Political Science  associate dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (now the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences)  director of the Program in Science  Technology  and Society  and head of MIT Foreign Languages and Literatures (now MIT Global Studies and Languages).Blackmer received his bachelor's degree from Harvard College  where he graduated magna cum laude in history and literature. He continued his studies at Harvard University  where he received a master’s in regional studies on the Soviet Union and a PhD in political science.He began his career at MIT as executive director of  and eventually served as assistant director of  the Center for International Studies (CIS). The CIS was created in 1951 to aid the United States in its Cold War battle against the Soviet Union. Blackmer later chronicled the center's beginnings in a fascinating book  “The MIT Center for International Studies: The Founding Years 1951 to 1969 ” to mark the center's 50th anniversary.“Don was a fine scholar ” says Richard Samuels  director of CIS and Ford International Professor of Political Science. “He wrote a widely cited book on the international relations of the Italian Communist Party  and co-authored a book with Max Millikan on U.S. foreign aid. He also published on the French Communist Party and on the Soviet Union. But  on his own account  scholarship was not his primary calling. He was an institution builder. In 1956  he turned down a job offer to work as an assistant to McGeorge Bundy at Harvard  to come down-river to MIT to serve as a deputy to Max Millikan and Walt Rostow — the dynamic and powerful founders of the MIT Center for International Studies. As executive director of the young CIS  he made it possible for them  and those he helped them recruit  to light up the scholarly landscape.”
Louis Kampf  professor emeritus of literature and women's and gender studies  dies at 91,Louis Kampf  professor emeritus of literature and women’s and gender studies at MIT  died in hospice care on May 30 in Cambridge  Massachusetts  at the age of 91. The cause was cardiac arrest.The only child of Oscar and Helen Kampf  he was born on May 12  1929 in Vienna  where his orthodox Jewish parents had migrated from Galicia  Poland. Between 1938 and 1942  he and his parents fled the Nazis  first going to Antwerp  Belgium  and thereafter to France  where Kampf’s father was interned as an enemy alien. Kampf and his mother traveled  with great difficulty  to Bagnères-de-Luchon in the Pyrenees in Vichy France and then to Marseilles and finally Casablanca  from where  in 1942  the family caught a “Companhia Colonial de Navegação” ship to the United States.By 1943  Kampf was fluent in German  French  English  and Yiddish and was learning Hebrew at a Yeshiva. He had read widely in literary classics  and was building the encyclopedic knowledge that distinguished his conversation throughout life. He graduated from George Washington High School  pursued an English major at Long Island University — where he was the sixth or seventh man on LIU’s national championship basketball team — and went to the University of Iowa to pursue graduate studies in comparative literature. In 1958  he went to Harvard University as a junior fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard; it was a three-year fellowship  and he spent his last year at the American Academy in Rome. In 1961  he gave the Lowell Lectures at Harvard  revised and published as “On Modernism; The Prospects for Literature and Freedom” (1967)  which won a Modern Language Association prize.To MIT and the MLA  in a time of turmoilHe joined the Literature section of MIT’s Humanities Department in 1961  and chaired the Literature faculty from 1967 to 1969. In 1968  at a tumultuous meeting of the Modern Languages Association  Kampf was nominated from the floor and elected as second vice-president by popular acclaim  which meant he would succeed in two years to the organization’s presidency. The MLA’s leadership was appalled: They had already announced the election of their chosen candidate  as had been done for many years. But America was in turmoil and Kampf  already known as an activist  represented the kind of change many of those gathered at the meeting in New York were demanding of their professional association  as well as of their country.The next year was one of political turmoil  with protests both peaceful and roiling campuses. In December of that year  Kampf was elected president of the MLA. He had no wish to hold that office  but obligingly fulfilled its obligations as a slightly bemused but dutiful president and as founder and shaper of its Radical Caucus.A new lens on literature and imperialismAlthough Kampf had always had an omnivorous appetite for everything connected with Western high culture — music  painting  literature and philosophy — his attitude shifted in the course of the Vietnam War. MIT Professor Emeritus Alvin Kibel remembers it thus: “Louis had been a sly  self-amused  captivating person  expounding Joyce and Proust and Diderot in a markedly graveled New York-Jewish accent. Now  as the U.S. had become more deeply committed to its Vietnam misadventure  Louis had come to regard the established high culture as  among other things  the product and agency of imperialism; and he thought it more important to resist this imperialism than to expound texts that  for all their value  were ideologically complicit in it.”Together with Richard Flacks and John McDermott  Kampf was a key participant in the late 1967-early 1968 founding of the New University Conference (NUC). Born in the wake of the dissolution of Students for a Democratic Society (the major student organization of the New Left)  NUC had chapters in over 40 campuses across the United States. Although a considerable number of young radicals in 1968 chose to abandon the university to carry on the struggle outside academia  many wanted to balance both a radical approach to the institutions in which they were located (by radical teaching  curriculum reform  democratic struggles for control) with activism outside their work — community struggles against imperialism  racism  sexual inequality  and capitalist economic organization. NUC was a magnet for hundreds  then thousands  of like-minded radicals in the academy. Kampf was a leader nationally and in the chapter at MIT.Legendary classroomsIn 1967  Kampf organized and became director of an organization of Cambridge academics called Resist  the first academic group devoted to supporting draft resistance to the Vietnam War. In 1968  Kampf was one of 130 MIT faculty members who signed an open letter to MIT’s president  Howard Johnson  urging him to end MIT’s relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense. Noam Chomsky was another  and for four years  the two of them co-taught an influential course called “Intellectuals and Social Change” that had hundreds of students — perhaps the largest enrollment in any humanities class in the Institute at any time before or since. Participation in the course set a significant number of students on the road to activism and to raising questions of social values.As a teacher  Kampf was consistently both a generous force of inclusion and a prod of conscience. He taught subjects in American literature and culture  contemporary literature  and world literature — although the boundaries between those categories tended to melt away  as did strict delineations of field  of literary movements  of genre and form. The topics of Kampf’s subjects  like the famous sequence he taught called “American Voices ” ranged boldly and widely afield  organized around categories like “ballads from Goethe to Willie Nelson” and “songs by working-class women.” His knowledge was wide — he could quote pretty much any source in its original language — and his capacity to keep learning all-inclusive."A wild ride" through literary erasIn 1984. Kampf was the first male professor in the fledgling Women’s Studies program at MIT  and his support for the program was significant. He taught subjects in “Women’s Literature ” in “Men’s Sports ” and in “Practical Feminism” — in which students went into the community and worked in organizations such as Rosie’s Place (a women’s shelter) and the “Our Bodies Ourselves” storefront health information clinic.He co-taught “Sex Roles in European and Latin American Fiction” with Margery Resnick  “a wild ride through literary eras  geographies  and styles because of his vast knowledge and conviction that there were almost no authors whose works were not amenable to productive interpretation of gender roles.” He was also well-versed about literature and the social construction of gender in areas of the world with which few at that time were familiar  introducing his colleagues to numerous African and Asian literary texts and essays.The parallel careerHis continual political involvement at all levels of networking and organizing was in many ways a parallel career to his academic work. Kampf played a key role in the development of “movement” organizations that opposed racism  sexism  homophobia  and war  and that supported Palestinian rights. Following its founding in 1967 in New York City  he set up the national office for Resist — an organization designed to support draft resisters in Cambridge. Across from the Post Office (where the FBI installed itself)  the Resist office became a hub for academics involved in anti-war activity.Other organizations in which he worked included the Ad Hoc Lebanon Emergency Committee  the Bethlehem Sister City Project  and the Center for Critical Education  which publishes the magazineRadical Teacher for which he wrote and edited. He worked on many issues from organizing academics to oppose the war in Vietnam to Israel/Palestine; AIDS activism; the exploitation of adjunct faculty; the responsibility of intellectuals; and what “radical teaching” actually meant. For most of his life he was engaged with these and other political issues — about which he worried and thought and sought to change.More mensch than ideologueBut Louis Kampf was more of a mensch than an ideologue. He loved to dance and took the floor whenever possible; one friend described him dancing after a meeting: “Acerbic and lyrical  all at the same instant and all showing on his face.” He knew volumes about the jazz of the last 60 years; many musicians knew him personally and cherished his knowledge and appreciation. He was passionate about all kinds of music  from grand opera  to early music  to jazz and country and everything in between. He could talk to anyone  and engaged everyone he met  opening himself to them and often hearing in response stories from their own lives. He spoke fluently about all aspects of his life and the world around him with great ironic humor.Above all  Kampf was a great friend. He leaves behind an enormous number of people who deeply miss and mourn him and will carry his memory into the future.For 30 years  Louis was the life partner of Jean Jackson  professor emerita of anthropology at MIT. He is also survived by his former wife  Ellen Cantarow of New York City  and a cousin  Howard Radzyner.
Bill Hanson  a founder of MIT Leaders for Global Operations  dies at 80,Bill Hanson  an inspirational founding figure of the MIT Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program and a mentor to hundreds of its alumni  died on July 15 at the age of 80.Hanson was senior vice president for manufacturing at the Digital Equipment Corporation  where he had a front-row seat to the challenges facing U.S. manufacturing in the 1980s  and brought this vision to his role helping found and develop LGO (then Leaders for Manufacturing  or LFM) in 1988 with MIT faculty including Kent Bowen  Thomas Magnanti  and the lateDon Rosenfield.Hanson moved full-time from the Digital Equiptment Corporation to MIT in 1996 to become LFM’s first industry co-director. He later helped found what is now theWilliam C. Hanson  Don W. Davis and Janice Klein Leadership Fundto honorDavis(LFM’s first leadership instructor) and support leadership training within LGO. He retired in 2012 to Mashpee  Massachusetts  with his wife  Bette.“Bill was an enlightened person with unusual warmth and a great passion for life  and he was a true friend to many of us ” says Magnanti  MIT Institute Professor. “He had a remarkable impact on manufacturing and industry  but also on education  especially at MIT. He was a beacon in bringing industry to the leadership of LFM. I had the privilege of working closely with him and benefited enormously from his wisdom  insight  and unfailing enthusiasm  as well as rooting with excitement with him for the Red Sox  Celtics  and Patriots.”"Bill left an indelible legacy through his support of the LGO program and its graduates and industrial partners ” says Jeff Wilke LGO ’93  CEO of Global Consumer at Amazon. “He generously modeled ethical leadership by listening carefully and helping students and alums hone their individual styles.”As a mentor to Leaders for Global Operations students  Hanson was known for asking questions that prompted students to look within themselves. “He asked what impact I wanted to have on the world  and how I would use the many opportunities I have been given to change lives for the better ” says Christina Simpson LGO ’11  senior manager for market development at Medtronic. “Bill inspired us all to be better and do more  and he will be greatly missed.”During her LGO admission interview  “I immediately sensed Bill’s kindness  his earnestness and his belief in people’s potential ” says venture investor Rachel Sheinbein LGO '04. “He was a wonderful mentor during my time at LGO  and it didn’t stop there. When I was making a critical career decision  he asked his famous question: Was I looking for a job  a career  or an environment? He reminded me of my own passions and encouraged me to take a risk. It was the best decision of my life  and I wouldn’t have made the leap without Bill.”SkipStone President A-P Hurd LGO ’04 had a similar experience during what seemed like a routine conversation  when Henson paused and asked  “What’s your legacy?”“I was taken aback. ‘What do you mean? I'm 27  I don't have a legacy.’ Bill replied  ‘Well  you've been given a lot of opportunity. You better start figuring it out  because it's not just going to happen by itself.’ To this day  that is one of the best questions anyone has ever asked me.”
Arthur Samberg  philanthropist and MIT Corporation life member  dies at 79,Arthur “Art” Samberg ’62  a pioneer in investment management and longtime member of the MIT Corporation  died of leukemia on July 14. He was 79.Reflecting his wide-ranging interests at MIT  Samberg served on the executive committee of the MIT Corporation and on visiting committees for the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics  Mathematics  and Nuclear Science and Engineering. He also served on the School of Science Dean’s Advisory Council  the MIT Energy Initiative External Advisory Board  and the MIT Investment Management Company Board. Samberg joined the Corporation in 2003.He and his wife Rebecca Samberg established a scholarship fund that has supported more than 200 MIT scholars since its inception  many throughout their MIT undergraduate careers. A gift from the couple also enabled a new conference facility at MIT  the Samberg Conference Center."Art Samberg would often say with pride that his life was transformed by MIT — so it is wonderfully fitting that he and Becky made possible the same transformative experience for so many young people with limited means but with all the talent to succeed here ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “Through the countless roles he took on in service to the Institute  MIT also benefited from his brilliant insight  wide-ranging curiosity  decisiveness  and extraordinary personal dedication. Every time we enjoy the exhilarating view from the Samberg Conference Center  we can take inspiration from Art’s warmth  playfulness  down-to-earth attitude  and open-hearted generosity. We miss him!”At the time the conference center was opened  Samberg said of MIT: “I have a tremendous and personal appreciation for what this place can do. Becky and I are delighted to be active members of the MIT community and to support key priorities that help keep the Institute strong.”Samberg was also a member of the Campaign Leadership Council  which assists MIT with high-level fundraising  and he served as co-chair of the Campaign for a Better World.Robert Millard  chair of the MIT Corporation  says Samberg’s contribution to MIT will be felt for years to come.“Art had extraordinary success in life and was constantly engaging with and giving back to his community. MIT was extremely lucky to receive his help in so many different ways ” Millard says. “We will miss him personally  but his impact on the Institute will continue. He embodied a precious combination of wisdom  generosity  and humility. His passing leaves many of us with a void. It is people like Art who have built and fortified the foundations of MIT’s greatness.”Samberg was born in the Bronx  New York  living there until he was 8  when his family moved to Tenafly  New Jersey. A top student in math and science at Tenafly High School  he chose to study at MIT  earning a bachelor’s degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering.“He cherished his time in Cambridge  and cultivated lifelong friendships ” said his son Joe Samberg in a eulogy at Temple Beth El of Northern Westchester in New York.Samberg then earned a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering at Stanford University — where he met another graduate student on a blind date  Becky  who would become his wife. After landing a job developing guidance and control technologies for missile systems at Lockheed Martin  Samberg decided his true calling was finance  earned an MBA at Columbia University  and took a job as an equity analyst at Kidder-Peabody.Later  while at money-management firm Dawson-Samberg Capital Management Inc.  he launched his own fund  which became Pequot Capital. Fifteen years after that  in 2001  Pequot was reported to be the largest hedge fund in the world  managing more than $15 billion.“My success in life is taking decent expertise in technology and combining it with finance ” said Samberg in a 2015 Bloomberg Radio interview  “and trying to apply those two things to help companies aggregate capital and grow and create jobs. I care about solving the world’s problems.”For all his seriousness about business  Samberg had an equally strong passion for engaging with people.“What made Dad especially proud was the fun-loving  team-oriented culture he fostered” at Pequot  said Joe Samberg  explaining that his father installed a basketball court at the firm that was located between the trading floor and the company’s marketing group.Written tributes from two of Samberg’s fellow members of the MIT Corporation spoke of his humility and his humor.Bob Johnson ’63  life member emeritus of the Corporation  said he worked with Samberg at Kidder Peabody  lost touch with him for over two decades  and then served on the MIT Corporation with Samberg for many years.“It was just chance that I got to work with Art at the beginning of our careers ” Johnson said. “Fifty-plus years later  in spite of his amazing successes  he was the still the same wonderful human being.”Lawrence Fish  also an MIT Corporation life member emeritus  said  “He had a delightful sense of humor. He never took himself too seriously.”Samberg’s son Jeff Samberg said his father believed in people’s ability to achieve if given the opportunity  and many came forward in the past few months to express gratitude for his mentorship. Because Samberg loved innovation  he was often thrilled by the ideas of entrepreneurs who would pitch to the family investment business he started in 2009. The projects taken on by the firm often had lofty aims  such as reversing climate change or curing cancer.Samberg made major philanthropic donations to other organizations ranging from Columbia Business School to New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital. His daughter  Laura Samberg Faino  oversees the work of the Samberg Family Foundation  established by Art and Becky to support various health  education  and Jewish causes in the New York area and nationally.“Dad truly left the world a better place than he found it ” said Jeff Samberg.Donations in Samberg’s memory may be made to Jacob Burns Film Center  Ossining Children’s Center  or Temple Beth El of Northern Westchester.
Tunney Lee  professor emeritus of urban planning  dies at 88,Tunney Lee  professor emeritus of urban planning and former head of the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP)  passed away of complications from cancer treatment on July 2 in Boston. He was 88 years old.An architect by training  Lee was also an accomplished planner  historian  and community activist. At MIT  his research focused on the process of community-based design  with a particular interest in high-density urban settings. He led frequent collaborations between MIT students and Boston-area neighborhoods. His approach to urban planning and architecture emphasized how these fields could be harnessed to empower and enhance the lives of people. When approaching design  Lee viewed the built environment through the lens of how individuals would construct  use  live  and interact with the creations of planners and architects.“It’s about understanding institutions ” said Lee  when discussing community input for a series of recommendations produced by DUSP students. “You never hear any discussion as to who is going to carry out this wonderful thing we’ve just designed. That’s just of not interest to them [typical design schools]. In contrast  we would have failed if we didn’t inculcate in our students the necessity for understanding the institutional arrangements at the same time as we talk about designs.”
Michael Hawley  former professor of media arts and sciences  dies at 58,Michael Hawley  a former MIT professor who was recognized globally as a modern-day Renaissance man  died on Wednesday  June 24  at his home in Cambridge  Massachusetts  after battling a long illness. He was 58.Hawley will be remembered for his extraordinary breadth of interests and talents  which spanned the fields of human-computer interfaces and sensing  musical performance and audio signal processing  digital cinema and libraries  documentary photography  exploration  and entrepreneurship. He will also be remembered as a deeply dedicated family man. Parenthood came late to Hawley and his wife  Nina You  who recently wrote: “We spent 15 years trying to have our son  Tycho. Mike’s cancer was discovered on his first Father’s Day last year; Tycho is now 18 months old and was the joy of Mike’s life. He put being a father at the very top of all his contributions to the world.”Hawley participated in some of the great digital breakthroughs of the last 40 years  from writing UNIX code at Bell Labs as a teenager  to his work pioneering digital cinema and sound technology at LucasFilm  to his innovation of large-imprint digital photo systems  which led to the 2003 publication of "Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Last Himalayan Kingdom " measuring 5’ x 7’ and weighing over 150 pounds  giving it the distinction of being documented as the world’s largest published book in the "Guinness Book of World Records."Long before arriving at MIT in 1986 as a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering as well as the newly established Program in Media Arts and Sciences  Hawley had already earned an impressive resume. After receiving undergraduate degrees in music and computer science at Yale University in 1983  his research pursuits took him first to Pierre Boulez’s IRCAM in Paris  where he developed one of the first graphic systems for displaying and editing musical scores  and then to Lucasfilm in San Rafael  California  where he helped to develop the SoundDroid  among other technologies. He then helped Steve Jobs start NeXT  working with Jobs to develop the first generation of digital books  including the writings of Charles Darwin and William Shakespeare  as well as the first digital dictionary (Merriam-Webster). “Central to this digital library was one of the very first search algorithms  conceived by Mike and the team to create a bridge between human curiosity and technology ” says Kate Smith  member of the original digital library team at NeXT.In reviewing Hawley’s application for graduate work at MIT before actually meeting him  Professor Emeritus Nicholas Negroponte  co-founder and former director of the Media Lab  recalls his competing to woo him away from Steve Jobs. “As I recollect ” says Negroponte  “my bait was Marvin Minsky.”After completing his doctoral dissertation  “Structure out of Sound ” under the direction of Minsky (for which he created technologies to transform historic early-20th century piano rolls into digital instructions for state-of-the-art robotic pianos)  Hawley accepted a faculty appointment in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  where he held the newly endowed Licklider Career Development Professorship  named for J.C.R. Licklider  a pioneer in the field of human-machine interfaces. In 1995  Hawley was named to the Alexander W. Dreyfoos  Jr. '54 Professorship in Media Arts and Sciences as a faculty member in the Program in Media Arts and Sciences.Like Minsky  Hawley shared a passion for music  and was agifted pianist and organist. Tod Machover  composer and Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media at the MIT Media Lab  says that “Mike lived and breathed music. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of unusual repertoire from Bach to Bernstein and Bolcom (including little-known Busoni transcriptions of Beethoven symphonies)  sported a breathtaking facility at the keyboard which allowed him to sight read just about anything  and communicated through his piano with the same directness  insight  and warmth that made him one of the world’s great public speakers.”This natural performance talent won Hawley first place (tying with Victoria Bragin) at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs in 2002. He performed numerous solo recitals  chamber concerts  and as a soloist with major orchestras  and had the distinction of accompanying world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma at the wedding of Bill Nye (“The Science Guy”). He was also prominently featured in the 2010 documentary “Bach & Friends.”At the Media Lab  Hawley headed the Personal Information Architecture research group and was a co-founder of the Toys of Tomorrow and Things That Think consortia  the latter of which provided an early insight into the myriad of ways that digital technologies would soon be seamlessly integrated with the physical atoms of our everyday world. In 1995  Hawley predicted the seismic societal shift that loomed. “This is an absolutely pivotal era ” he said  “We’re moving from a world where none of our everyday things communicate  to one where all of them will.” He imagined a not-too-distant future when we could send bitstreams into almost anything — even into the body.By 1997 Hawley and his students did just that. That year  Hawley (with two of his students) ran his first Boston Marathon  wired “inside and out” with their newly developed microelectronic monitoring devices  to transmit data on their vital signs and position during the race. As with many new experiments  there were some glitches. The data transmission did not work in real-time  and the weight of the devices also took a toll: only Hawley managed to carry the gear all the way to the finish line. But this so-called “Black Box” project was pioneering in its ability to monitor the human body under extreme physical conditions  as well as to provide situational information based on context and location.Building on the Boston Marathon breakthrough  Hawley and his group created one of the first consumer heart-rate monitors  in the form of a $500 000 red-pulsating diamond brooch developed in collaboration with Harry Winston Jewelers.Hawley’s experimentation took him to all corners of the world  most notably leading one of the first major scientific expeditions on Mount Everest  which involved the group developing new systems for monitoring geological and ecological phenomena. Other expeditionary research included dog sledding in Norway  plant biology in Hawaii  and reef ecology in Indonesia  all to study new technological ways to sense the environment  and to better understand human performance in — and effect upon — the world around us.Robert Poor  Hawley’s first PhD student at the Media Lab and a participant on the Everest expedition  says  “Mike crossed and often broke physical and societal rules  playfully disrupting normal life and re-establishing it on a new basis. In doing so  he cajoled many of us students to followhis example: to think bigger and to have the courage to push our own boundaries.”The eclectic nature of Hawley’s interests always went well beyond his academic pursuits. He was a one-time Duncan yo-yo champion  luger  and member of the U.S. Bobsled Federation. At the Media Lab  he also developed software for a computerized sewing machine that allowed him to translate pictures into thread  and then used this technology to make sweatshirts for the Media Lab’s ice hockey team and to wire antennae for the lab’s cyborgs.In 2002  Hawley became director of special projects at the Media Lab  and in 2008 left MIT to become Director of the EG (Entertainment Gathering) conference. Held annually in Monterey  California  EG brings together a broad range of visionaries and inventors  thinkers and makers from essentially every creative field of endeavor  retaining the excitement and profound interdisciplinarity of the Media Lab.“One of the qualities I treasured most in Mike was the extraordinary breadth of his talents and intellect  which were always on full display at his EG conference ” says Laurene Powell Jobs  founder of the Emerson Collective. “He had this incredible ability to look at the world in all of its complexity  all of its messiness  and make the connections — of people  of ideas — that so many of us might have otherwise missed. He was also fiercely passionate about our democracy  always urging action  always full of ideas for what needed to be done. Mike enriched the lives of everyone he touched.”Architect Moshe Safdie  who developed a close friendship with Hawley  remembers him as deeply humanist and overflowing with compassion. “Michael was always the great connector  bringing us knowledge  understanding and pleasure ” Safdie says.Hawley was honored as the first recipient of the Jack Kilby International Award for innovation in science in 1990. He was a fellow and trustee of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale University and served on the boards of the Rutgers Jazz Institute  the Vanguard Group  and several prominent companies  including Kodak.Artificial intelligence pioneer Danny Hillis remembers Hawley as “a true polymath who constantly sought out beautiful ideas in art  music  culture and science  and shared themjoyfully with his friends.”Echoing this sentiment  Robert Millard  chairman of the MIT Corporation  remembers Hawley “as a true artist — not just a craftsman — in everything he touched. He achieved beauty in life by rigorously seeking it  living it  absorbing it  improving it  transforming it. We will miss him  but we will always have him.”In late April  Millard and 16 other colleagues and friends participated in anonline festschriftorganized by the Media Lab and hosted by NPR’s Peter Sagal to pay tribute to Hawley.In addition to his wife Nina and son Tycho  Hawley is survived by his father  George Hawley  and two brothers  Patrick and Stephen.Michael Hawley’s ideas and communities will be celebrated in various forms and at various times  to be announced.
Dietmar Seyferth  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 91,Dietmar Seyferth  professor emeritus in the Department of Chemistry and pioneer in the field of organometallic chemistry  died of complications from Covid-19 on Saturday  June 6. He was 91.“Dietmar’s contributions to teaching  mentoring  and the field of organometallic chemistry comprise an enduring legacy to the world ” said ProfessorTroy Van Voorhis  head of the Department of Chemistry  upon learning of Seyferth’s passing. “He continues to be held in the highest regard and we will remember him fondly.”Born on Jan. 11  1929 in Chemnitz  Germany  Seyferth emigrated to Buffalo  New York  with his parents  Herbert and Elisabeth  in 1933. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Buffalo  graduating summa cum laude in 1951  and earned his PhD  under the supervision of Professor Eugene Rochow  from Harvard University in 1955. While a teaching assistant for a first-year chemistry laboratory  Seyferth met Helena McCoy  a Radcliffe College student taking the course. Their closer acquaintance was delayed until the end of the term  but they eventually became engaged and were married on Aug. 25  1956  the beginning of a romance that would continue for the next 63 years.Seyferth conducted postdoctoral studies at the Inorganic Chemistry Institute  Technische Hochschule  Munich  and at Harvard University. He briefly worked for Dow Corning in Michigan before joining the MIT Department of Chemistry as an assistant professor in 1957.Emeritus ProfessorStephen J. Lippardhad the distinct fortune of knowing Seyferth in two capacities: first as an “inspiring teacher ” when Lippard took Seyferth’s graduate course as a PhD student  then as a “valued colleague and good friend” when he  too  joined the Department of Chemistry faculty.“[Dietmar] was a generous man  who readily offered his small violin to my son Alex when he began his lessons at an early age ” recalls Lippard. “His work as founding editor ofOrganometallicspropelled it to the premier journal of its kind in the world. Together with Al Cotton  he built the inorganic faculty at MIT through the hiring of young colleagues who brought exciting  complementary areas of research to the chemistry department  elevating it to arguably the best place in the world for students  postdocs  and visiting scientists to seek education  training  and excellent career opportunities in the various branches of the subdivision. Dietmar was a bon vivant whose presence could light up a room and whose loyal friendship  counsel  and wisdom will be sorely missed. He had a long and fruitful life  which brings comfort to those of us who mourn his passing.”Emeritus ProfessorFrederick Greenefirst crossed paths with Seyferth when they were both graduate students at Harvard in the 1950s  though they really got to know one another once they joined the MIT chemistry faculty. “I have had the opportunity to see his wonderful career in its entirety ” says Greene. “He certainly was a towering figure in organometallic chemistry  both in his research and in his work as editor of the major journal in that field … Let me simply call attention to his humanity  his decency  his respect for others  and his sense of humor. Quite recently  in 2018  Dietmar and I have had several audio/video sessions with Professor Danheiser  exploring aspects of the MIT chemistry department in the years of the 1950s to the mid-1970s. These have taken place at the home of Dietmar and Helena  and were made possible by Liz McGrath and Emrick Elias. It was a real pleasure to be with Dietmar. He is greatly missed.”Seyferth’s research career ranged broadly in the area of organometallic chemistry  with an emphasis on the organic derivatives of the main group elements  particularly lithium  mercury  silicon  germanium  tin  and phosphorus  as well as on studies in transition metalorganic chemistry with a focus on the chemistry of organocobalt cluster complexes and sulfur ligand-containing iron carbonyls.“Dietmar was a wonderful colleague who also was a brilliant and dedicated organometallic chemist ” says ProfessorStephen L. Buchwald. “It was most fitting that he served as the first editor of the then-new American Society journal Organometallics. I can remember how happy I was the day that it was announced that he had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences  an honor that was very fitting.”In addition to his work as editor forOrganometallics  a position he held for 28 years  and membership to the National Academy of Sciences  Seyferth served as a regional editor of theJournal of Organometallic Chemistryand was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  as well as the German National Academy of Sciences. He received four national awards from the American Chemical Society  including the Award in Organometallic Chemistry. Seyferth officially retired and became an emeritus professor in 1999  although  according to his wife  he “flunked” retirement and continued to write and teach  spending time in his office at MIT every day  for many more years.Seyferth was an inspiration to his fellow faculty members as well as his students and members of his research group. “Dietmar was a bedrock of the organometallic community throughout his storied career ” says ProfessorKit Cummins. “As editor ofOrganometallics  Dietmar worked generously and tirelessly to aid authors from around the globe in improving their manuscripts and publications.  He ensured quick turnaround in the peer-review process with notes to reviewers in his distinctive handwriting  typically delivered by fax. Because of Dietmar  I submitted my group’s first paper toOrganometallics  taking advantage of proximity to hand-deliver to him the required four copies. Dietmar was wonderful with students  especially in the oral examinations where his use of the Socratic method proved most effective. In the classroom and through his research  Dietmar popularized main-group element chemistry  a subfield that was in need of a staunch champion of Dietmar’s scientific stature in the U.S. His ideas impacted greatly my own career directions  as a result  and I had the privilege of taking over teaching of the 5.05 subject when he retired from it. He was generous with junior faculty  myself included  dispensing scientific tips with deep insight and  often  humor. He never tired of listening to me relate my group’s latest discoveries; he was a great listener who really listened. For all of his professional accomplishments  Dietmar was also a dear personal friend to many of his colleagues. I am very grateful that one of Dietmar’s former students  Robert L. Lambert PhD ’73  saw fit to endow the Seyferth Lecture as a permanent and enduring testament to the impact of Dietmar on organometallic chemistry. This lectureship will keep Dietmar’s name and legacy alive in the social and scientific fabric of our department.”The inauguralDietmar Seyferth Lecture in Organometallic Chemistrywas held in April 2019. Lambert credits Seyferth for much of his self-discovery as a graduate student. “As is typical with many graduate students  Dietmar firmly caused me learn about myself to at least the same extent as chemistry through his pointed  but patient  expectations of meaningful results ” says Lambert. “Although the leash was very stretchable  a ‘starter  not finisher’ has to learn to finish  and his toleration and guidance toward a goal usually turned out to be gratifying for me. His communication skills were extraordinary — as a beginning second-year student  I had been working for several weeks on a grant proposal  only to have him read it and then tell me to get a tablet and pencil: he dictated nearly three pages at a slow  conversational speed. I then became aware of the importance of precision and background knowledge in technical communication. In a certain sense he was overly fair. With a variety of students from different experiences and knowledge in his group  he expected reasonable standards of technical performance  but would let us work toward the limits of our individual capabilities and interests on relevant ideas. He set a strong example for challenging yourself to be observant about what you were doing and thoughtful about why you were doing it.”“Dietmar Seyferth was truly a giant in the field of inorganic and organometallic chemistry ” says ProfessorRick Danheiser. “His pioneering contributions in the chemistry of organolithium and organosilicon compounds were particularly significant  and a number of methods used in organic synthesis have their roots in chemistry that was developed in the Seyferth laboratory.”Among Seyferth’s greatest contributions was his dedication to his students and his commitment to keeping in touch with them long after they left the halls of MIT. “My strongest and fondest remembrance of Dietmar is that for many of the more than 50 years of our interactions  when I talked with him he could give me pretty detailed rundowns of every generation of his students  where each person was now  what they were doing  and little bits about their lives ” says Robert Damrauer PhD ’68. “He was a very busy man  a very influential  fine scientist and editor  yet he took such pride in his students and their accomplishments. My wonderful friend  Michel Pereyre  was a postdoc from Bordeaux  when I was a grad student. Michel tells the story that Dietmar told him that he (Michel) was the best French postdoc that he (Dietmar) had ever had. Michel says it took him some time to realize he was the only French postdoc he had ever had.”“I can truly say that the training I received under Dietmar’s mentorship  not just chemistry  but writing and administration  laid a sturdy foundation that allowed me to build a meaningful and satisfying career  first in industry  and then  for 33 years so far  in academia ” says Joseph Merola PhD ’78.Gary Wiseman PhD ’85 remembers Seyferth as a great friend and mentor. “When we first met  I was an enthusiastic but inexperienced and unproven 21-year-old kid ” Wiseman recalls. “[Seyferth] gave me a chance on a brand new project (silazane ceramic precursors) and it changed my life and career forever. Dietmar provided close supervision in the beginning (daily instructions via the famous yellow sheets)  building my confidence by enabling early success. But he steadily loosened the reins and allowed me the freedom to take risks and drive the project on my own into completely new directions. All of us who came through his group owe him not just for the technical education we received  but for the mentorship model he taught us and for his lasting contribution to our development as scientists  managers  parents  and people.”Shane Krska PhD ’97 hails Seyferth as being “an example and inspiration of what it means to be a scientist and a scholar. When I think of Dietmar  I can hear his big  booming voice say  ‘So  what’s new?’ as he walks through the laboratory door on a Friday afternoon  accompanied by his infectious laugh and the sound of change jingling in his pocket ” remembers Krska. “I can picture the rows of cabinets in his office  filled with 3x5 index cards meticulously summarizing nearly every paper he had ever read  as we sit at his desk for hours going over a galley proof word-by-word to make sure there isn’t a single mistake. Most of all  I remember how he shared his love for chemistry  expressed in mimeographed crystal structures of methyllithium  wickedly obscure cumulative exam questions  and impossibly high standards for passing elemental analyses.”Earle Marie Hanson PhD ‘69 joined Seyferth’s research group in fall 1964  freshly graduated from Cornell University. Though she was one of very few female chemistry graduate students at MIT  Hanson was one of three women in the Seyferth group  and he made them feel safe and accepted. She credits Seyferth — “a respected and well-published chemist” — with launching the members of his group into productive and successful careers. “Dietmar set high standards for our research and publications and kept our noses to the grindstone with his almost daily inquiry of ‘What’s new?’”  recalls Hanson. “It kept us focused on the daily as well as the longer-term course of our research  and we tried to be prepared in order to please and engage him. It wasn’t just hard work. Dietmar and his wonderful wife Helena were excellent hosts and built group camaraderie with yearly winter parties at their home and a fun beach barbecue party at their summer place on Cape Cod. Dietmar was a tough competitor in the pick-up beach soccer games.”David Mueller PhD ’70 made the decision to attend graduate school at MIT based solely on the prospect of joining Seyferth’s research group  which Mueller described as a family  with Seyferth in the role of pater familius. In recalling his mentor’s unpretentious nature  he remembers an instance in which his wife  Esther  first addressed Seyferth as “Dr. Seyferth.”“He told her he could never deliver a baby ” Mueller says. “We called him Dietmar. His enthusiasm was contagious. We spent long hours in the lab. He encouraged us with his ‘What’s new?’ visits  and he challenged us  but didn’t micromanage. He partied and skied with us. His Christmas punch was legendary  and he marched with us against the injustices of the late ’60s.”Craig Masterman PhD ’93 mourns the loss of not only a great chemist  but “an enormous human being” who loved his students as though they were part of his family and had great respect for Russian and German chemists. “Dietmar was so kind  in a Germanic way  which I can really appreciate being mostly of German descent myself ” says Masterman. “When my mom passed when I was at MIT in the middle of my thesis  he told me to go and come back when I felt up to it. For me  that was about one week. I think he always respected strength.”James Burlitch PhD ’65 carries fond musical memories of his mentor. “As a graduate student in the early 1960s  working with Dietmar was interesting  challenging  and fun ” says Burlitch. “On returning from one of his many speaking engagements  he would tour the labs to visit with each of us; as he approached a lab bench he’d say  ‘What’s new?’ In time  this expression was featured in a song written by grad student Ross Armbrecht and sung by our quartet in four-part harmony at one of Dietmar’s memorable group parties: ‘What’s new? See the spots on the ceiling. What’s new? Where all the paint is peeling. What’s new? I have that strange old feeling  Dietmar’s back in town.’”Seyferth is survived by his wife  Helena; son Eric and his wife Sara Reynolds of Bennington  Vermont; son Karl of Lexington  Massachusetts; daughter Elisabeth and her husband Michael McKenna of Lexington; grandchildren Allison Perry and her husband Brandon  Julia Seyferth  Elise Seyferth  Theodore McKenna  and Marshall McKenna; and great-grandchildren Caleb and William Perry.
Professor Emeritus Michael Athans  pioneer in control theory  dies at 83,MIT electrical engineering and computer science Professor Emeritus Michael Athans died peacefully on May 26 at his home in Clearwater  Florida  at the age of 83.Athans was born in Drama  Macedonia  Greece in 1937. He came to the United States in 1954 for a one-year exchange visit under the auspices of the American Field Service (AFS)  and attended the Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley  California. His year in the AFS was a defining one. He fell in love with America during this time and decided to stay in the United States when his AFS year was over. He then went on to attend the University of California at Berkeley from 1955 to 1961  where he received his BS in 1958 (with highest honors)  MS in 1959  and PhD in control in 1961.Athans had a remarkable career in academia. A pioneer in the field of control theory  he helped shape modern control theory and spearheaded  together with students and colleagues  the field of multivariable control system design and the field of robust control. These fundamental contributions were made in the course of Athans’s long and deeply accomplished tenure at MIT  as a member of the technical staff at Lincoln Laboratory from 1961 to 1964  and as a Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty member from 1964 to 1998.According to John Tsitsiklis  the Clarence J. Lebel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  who was also a student of Athans: “It is hard to overstate the impact and influence Mike had on the field of systems control theory. He led the development of central methodologies. He broadened the scope of the field. And he amplified his impact by supporting and nurturing a whole generation of researchers  including myself.”He further influenced the field as a transformative director of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)  which was called the Electronic Systems Laboratory when Athans took the helm in 1974. He recognized the promise of the systems and control field in a vast array of domains  the need for new methodologies geared toward large-scale systems  and the confluence of control and communications. In this spirit  Athans changed the lab’s name to LIDS in 1978  which remains the lab’s name today. This forward-looking choice reflected the lab’s intellectual expansion and the embrace of new domains  ranging from transportation to energy to economics and more.Key to this expansion was groundbreaking work by Athans and colleagues that made multivariable control design into a practical engineering methodology that could be applied to complex  large-scale  distributed systems — which Athans saw  correctly  as the future of system design. This adaptation of control methodology  combined with ideas from communications  networks  optimization  and control  helped chart the lab’s course  and was a central achievement of Athans’s intellectual and professional leadership during his tenure as director  which ended in 1981.Athans was not only a highly-accomplished researcher  but also an award-winning and dedicated educator: In what was the aspect of his work he cherished most  he mentored and supervised the theses of more than 100 graduate students over the course of his career; he developed a course on modern control theory  producing nearly 70 videotaped lessons that were critical to the training of hundreds of practicing engineers; and he co-authored three books  most notably “Optimal Control” (with Peter Falb)  a foundational text that influenced generations of students. In addition  he transitioned his research by co-founding  in 1978  ALPHATECH in Burlington  Massachusetts  where he served as chair of the board of directors and chief scientific consultant.Described by friends as a vital force  Athans guided his students with care and often touched the lives of his friends and colleagues in profound ways. “Mike was immensely important to me  especially at the start of my time on the faculty at MIT ” says Alan Willsky  the Edwin Sibley Webster Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a former LIDS director. “He was exceptionally generous  providing me with travel support and opportunities to lead research programs early in my career.”Willsky’s remembrance of Athans as a strong  generous presence has been echoed by many colleagues and former students  including Nils Sandell PhD '74  who says “Michael was my PhD supervisor  ran LIDS when I was an MIT faculty member  and he was the founding chairman of ALPHATECH  where I was president. He was a great teacher with a highly entrepreneurial spirit and was a steadfast friend. I will miss him greatly.”Upon retirement  Athans moved to Lisbon  Portugal  for 15 years and received a honoris causa doctorate from the Universidade Técnica de Lisboa in 2011. Upon returning from Portugal  Athans chose to live in Clearwater  Florida to be near his sons Brett and Sean  as well as his grandson Michael.Michael Athans was predeceased by his son John Athans Spodick. He is survived by his loving partner Lena Corsentino; sons Stephen Athans Spodick and his wife Kathleen of Holden  Massachusetts  Brett Athans of St. Petersburg  Florida  Sean Athans of St. Pete Beach  Florida  and Stavros Valavanis  of New York  New York; as well as four grandchildren — Ryan and Christopher Spodick of Burlington  Vermont  Nicholas Spodick of Holden  Massachusetts  and Michael Athans of St. Petersburg  Florida. He is also survived by his brother Sotiris Athanasiadis and wife Sofia of Thessaloniki  Greece  and their two children  Chrysa and Yannis.He will be remembered for his leadership  kindness  sharp wit  strong will  and stories of growing up in Greece.

Paul Thomas  MIT’s “Mr. Magnet ” dies at 77,Paul Thomas  best known as MIT’s “Mr. Magnet ” passed away peacefully on May 4 at the age of 77  after a five-year battle with Parkinson’s disease.By the time he retired from MIT in 2014  the technical supervisor at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) had introduced over 500 000 school children to the mysteries of magnetism with his Mr. Magnet Science Show.Thomas adopted the persona of “Mr. Magnet” when he became involved in PSFC in-house high school education activities  performing hands-on demonstrations for local students. He began visiting local schools in 1992  borrowing the center’s blue van to transport his demos. But as his hand-built demonstrations increased in number and size  he needed larger vehicles. At the height of the program  Mr. Magnet was transporting more than 6 000 pounds of equipment in a white cargo-styled truck  purchased by MIT. Although focusing on the local area  the program traveled as far as New Orleans  Louisiana  and made multiple appearances at the Science Bowl in Washington.Thomas' rolling demonstrations  which he built in his lab or at home in his garage  allowed him to introduce students to magnetic levitation with a “floating frying pan ” or to demonstrate how magnets can be used to “magneform” metal foil into the shape of a dish. He could explain the electric force that attracts or repels matter using a Van de Graff generator  Rice Krispees  and ping pong balls. Thomas created a miniature “White House” equipped with numerous light bulbs that could only be lit by willing students generating electricity with their own muscle power. He built “The Boomer” based on Harold "Doc" Edgerton’s original plans  and used it to launch a plush Garfield toy  via a booming magnetic pulse  into the excited audience.Through his program  students learned the importance of magnetism  the different ways to produce electricity  and the physics of particles and motion  all while laughing and having hands-on fun. Even when physical limitations forced Thomas to stop traveling  he continued to educate and entertain students at in-house events. He also created portable demonstrations for others to use at science expos and local schools.While educating and entertaining K-12 students  Thomas was also mentoring MIT graduate students. He encouraged them to accompany him when he traveled to schools  and incorporated them into his PSFC outreach day demonstrations  showing by his example how to engage students with presence and humor  inspiring a next generation of educators.Arturo Dominguez PhD '13  science education senior program leader at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory  was one of those students. "When I arrived at the PSFC as an incoming graduate student ” he remembers  “it was clear that public outreach was highly valued  and this effort was led by Paul Thomas. His passion for getting students of all ages excited about science and engineering was infectious and was a great source of inspiration for me and a big reason I decided to dedicate my professional life to outreach and science education."The Mr. Magnet program received local and national acclaim as a model for bringing the excitement of science to the minds and the hearts of young people. In recognition of his service and abilities  MIT honored Thomas with several awards  including the Gordon Y. Billard Award (1997)  the Infinite Mile Award (2001) and the Excellence Award (2001). In 2010 he received an Appreciation Award from the U.S. Department of Energy  which provided some support for the program  as well as a Governor’s Citation from Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Timothy P. Murray “in recognition of nearly 20 years of dedicated service to the ‘Mr. Magnet’ program.”Born Dec. 16  1942 in Newton  Massachusetts  Thomas became interested in engineering when  as a boy  he repeatedly took apart and reassembled his parents’ toaster and radio. He attended Wellesley High School through his junior year  graduating from Natick High School in 1960. After graduating from technical school  Thomas joined High Voltage Engineering Corporation and worked under the guidance of Robert J. Van de Graaff developing high voltage apparatus for research. He joined MIT in 1983  where  as part of a team of scientists and engineers he supervised the integration of computer controls on a large-scale fusion experiment.At the Plasma Science and Fusion Center  Thomas worked on a number of projects  including a plasma arc furnace and a continuous emissions monitoring system for incinerators and power plants  both related to nuclear waste remediation and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. A colleague on this project  Principal Research Engineer Leslie Bromberg  remembers Thomas as great supervisor and mentor: “He had a number of students  technicians  and interns under his supervision  and was always interested in their development as well as in completing the tasks at hand. His eagerness to help and his experience was invaluable  keeping us safe and on schedule. His enthusiasm  good humor  and eagerness to go above and beyond energized the group.”Thomas was a loving family man. He met his one true love  Louise Geary  at a town dance when he was 15 years old. Married in 1966  they celebrated 50 years together in 2016. Thomas was committed to his two sons  coaching them in sports  and taking an active role in their educational interests. An avid fisher  he looked forward to fishing expeditions with his sons and great-nieces.Thomas is predeceased by his wife Louise (2018)  and survived by sons Peter Thomas and Oakley Thomas and family; nieces Debbie Hayes and fiancé Julio Fontecchio and Diane Byrne and husband Walter; and great-nieces Katie Hausken and husband Krist  Holly Hayes  Mary Byrne  and Laura Byrne. He is predeceased by his brother  Theodore  and sister  Roberta.Donations in his memory may be made to the Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the Boston Medical Center  Shapiro Center  725 Albany Street  7th Floor  Suite 7B  Boston  MA 02118.
Yukio Okamoto  Japanese diplomat and MIT research fellow  dies at 74,Yukio Okamoto  a Japanese diplomat and fellow at MIT  died from Covid-19 on April 24 at the age of 74. The former special advisor to two prime ministers of Japan joined the Center for International Studies (CIS) in 2012 as a Robert E. Wilhelm fellow and served as a distinguished research fellow at CIS until his death.“Yukio brought to MIT an unparalleled set of experiences on the world stage. A great loss of a great man — and friend of us all ” said Richard Samuels  Ford International Professor of Political Science and director of CIS.Samuels said in an interview with Japan's media outlet NHK that Okamoto never stopped working vigorously for better understanding between the United States and Japan  and that he has never known anyone to be more committed to maintaining healthy bilateral relations than Okamoto was.From 1968 to 1991  Okamoto was a career diplomat in Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His overseas postings included stints in Paris at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in the embassies in Cairo  Egypt  and Washington. He retired from the ministry in 1991 and established Okamoto Associates  a political and economic consultancy.Post-retirement  Okamoto had served in a number of advisory positions. From 1996 to 1998  he was special advisor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. From October 2001 to March 2003  he was special advisor to the cabinet. From March 2003 to March 2004  he was special advisor on Iraq to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Concurrent with the above last two posts  he was chair of the Prime Minister's Task Force on Foreign Relations. Until September 2008  he was a member of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's Study Group on Diplomacy.Okamoto was an adjunct professor of international relations at Ritsumeikan University as well as Tohoku University. He sat on the boards of directors of several multinational companies. He also served as the president of Shingen'eki Net  a nonprofit group for active seniors with 16 000 members. In addition  Okamoto wrote books on Japanese diplomacy and government and was a regular contributor to major newspapers and magazines. He was a well-known public speaker and a frequent guest on public affairs and news broadcasts.While at MIT  Okamoto was an informal mentor to graduate students and a highly valued colleague to faculty and research staff. He worked with a study group from MIT and Harvard University to produce most of the text for a forthcoming memoir. The Center for International Studies will continue to work with his family and colleagues to bring this to fruition.Okamoto also  during his MIT tenure  gave dozens of public presentations around the United States on topics related to U.S.-Japan relations and to Asian international relations. He did all this while working vigorously behind the scenes to repair Japan’s relationship with China and to help those in need in northeastern Japan after the triple catastrophes of March 2011 — the earthquake  tsunami  and nuclear meltdown. He also founded the Signal of Hope Fund  an initiative he established to assist the Tohoku fisheries industry recover from these disasters.
Daniel Kemp  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 83,Daniel S. Kemp  professor emeritus in the Department of Chemistry  died peacefully and comfortably from respiratory complications due to Covid-19  after a battle with dementia  on Saturday  May 2. He was 83.“Dan’s broad research reached across disciplines and he was famous for his ability to captivate both students and faculty with his insight and enthusiasm ” said Professor Troy Van Voorhis  head of the Department of Chemistry  upon learning of Kemp’s passing. “He will be long remembered for his devotion to students and his influential contributions to our department.”Born on Oct. 20  1936 in Portland  Oregon  Kemp was a longtime resident of Boston  Massachusetts. He completed his undergraduate studies at Reed College in 1958  and earned his PhD  under the supervision of Nobel laureate Professor RB Woodward  from Harvard University in 1964. Kemp subsequently began an illustrious teaching and research career as a professor of organic chemistry at MIT that would span nearly half a century  culminating in his transition to professor emeritus in 2009.During his decades as a member of the chemistry department faculty  Kemp’s impact was felt by his peers as well as his students. Gregory Petsko  now an emeritus professor of biochemistry and chemistry at Brandeis University  recalls Kemp as a titan of encouragement and integrity when Petsko was a young  newly recruited MIT chemistry department faculty member. “The encouragement and support  both intellectually and emotionally  of a senior colleague can make all the difference in your life ” Petsko says. “Dan Kemp was the source of that support for me. He believed in what I was trying to do and encouraged me to follow my own path no matter what. I watched him do the same for a number of others over the years and observed all of them try to be a little like him. English poet and playwright Robert Browning said  in effect  that the best measure of the height of a person’s mind was the length of the shadow it cast. By that measure  Dan Kemp was a giant. I have spent my life surrounded by smart people  but Dan had the best-developed intellect I have ever encountered. He had both an intellectual and a moral integrity that I have always admired. Like everything of value  it was not without cost  but it was a price he seemed willingly to pay  and we are all richer for it.”Nicholas Galaktos PhD ’84  now the global head of life sciences at the Blackstone Group  carries similar memories of his mentor’s commitment to leading by example. “Dan’s extraordinary intellect  curiosity  and thoughtfulness that extended well beyond science  as well his deep caring and consideration of others  will be with me forever ” says Galakatos. “He laid down the foundation of my scientific training when I was a summer intern  and mentored me through my PhD and beyond. I will never forget working the night shift for several months to align with his book writing project  [which was] probably the most productive learning experience I ever had.”“He was the finest educator I ever encountered  with strong interests in both undergraduate and graduate teaching ” recalls Professor EmeritusFrederick Greene. “Following major changes in the core requirements adopted by MIT in the late 1960s  Dan created a splendid one-semester course in chemistry  required of all entering students. Dan went on to create new first- and second-semester courses in organic chemistry  to the high acclaim of many  many MIT students. Dan was a master in the lecture hall and in the material he presented.”Kemp made several seminal contributions to basic science  organic chemistry  and protein biochemistry. In his early years  the eponymous Kemp’s triacid  the Kemp elimination and decarboxylation reactions were among his developments in organic chemistry. Having switched his interests to protein biochemistry in the second half of his career  Kemp contributed significantly to the basic understanding of the intrinsic rules governing protein folding and stability.“Dan Kemp made everlasting contributions ” says Firmenich Professor of ChemistryRonald T. Raines’80. “He was not only agripping teacher  who infused his classroom with the elegance and excitement of chemistry  but also a brilliant and prescient scientist  who founded the (now vibrant) fields of templated peptide ligation and nucleated helices and sheets.”Novartis Professor EmeritaJoAnne Stubbecarries fond memories of enjoying Boston Classical Symphony outings with Kemp and others  and hailed him as a teacher extraordinaire. “Given my most important contributions have been in teaching  I aspired to be a ‘Kemp’ ” she says. “We met frequently  either at the junk food machines located in the tunnels of MIT  or walking along the Charles River  rain or shine … I still remember the day at a Gordon Research Conference in Bioorganic Chemistry when he told me how much he enjoyed my lecture. I am reminded of him every day because of a huge oriental rug he gave away  which graces my living room in Arlington. His bird had eaten off all the fringe on each end.”Another element of Kemp’s legacy is a successful organic chemistry textbook  first published in 1980  of which he was the leading author. His research was widely awarded  and among his numerous honors are the Everett Moore Baker Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching  the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award  and the Ralph F. Hirschmann Award in Peptide Chemistry.Scott E. Denmark ’75  now the Reynold C. Fuson Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  credits joining Kemp’s research group as “unarguably the most influential experience of [his] undergraduate career.”“Dan was a sui generisRenaissance man ” recalls Denmark. “Fiercely private  once he trusted you  he would open up to reveal his vast knowledge of so many dimensions of scholarship. In my nearly 50 years of studying and practicing chemistry  I have met many brilliant scientists  but no one with the combination of intellectual breadth and depth of Dan Kemp. My fondest memories of the MIT years are the midnight hours spent in his basement office sitting on beanbag chairs  just listening to him talk about literature  poetry  music  gemstones  and of course chemistry. One IAP session  Dan did dramatic interpretations of Shakespeare’s plays. Is it any wonder why his Chem 542 lectures were so legendary? A truly beautiful mind.”Kemp’s impact on his students transcended generations: Daniel Harris ’68 and his son  Doug ’98  both had the pleasure of being taught by Kemp in their first years at MIT. Kemp’s influence on the father and son duo proved to be the gift that kept on giving.“Dan Kemp’s inspired teaching set my son Doug and me on our paths as chemists when we took his organic chemistry class as freshmen at MIT  one generation apart ” says the senior Harris. “[For this reason ] in 2007  my wife Sally and I established theDaniel S. Kemp Summer Fellowship.”An avid reader and student of human nature  philosophy  and culture  Kemp traveled the world extensively. He spent sabbaticals at the University of Oxford  UK and the Technical University of Munich  Germany as an awardee of the prestigious Humboldt Research Fellowship. A contemporary of the late Julia Child  Kemp also had a passion for cooking and food  in particular French cuisine and baking. He loved gemology  an art that allowed him to combine his passion for science  art  and design  and over the years he built an impressive collection of self-cut gemstones.Kemp’s life was driven by his intellectual brilliance  love for research  teaching  mentorship in science  and the performing arts  and was fulfilled by his deep emotional intelligence and altruism. He made numerous contributions to causes he cared about deeply — the abolishment of capital punishment  the ensured continued access to biomedical research funding for exceptional scientists (he was a prostate cancer survivor)  and sharing his love for and learning from his decades of teaching. In 2014  Kemp made a generous donation to Reed College to help establish the Center for Teaching and Learning  a resource to support faculty and staff in strengthening teaching.John V. Frangioni  Professor of Medicine and Radiology at Harvard Medical School and CEO of The Curadel Companies  recalls a life-changing philanthropic act of Kemp’s. “Very few people know this about him  but Dr. Kemp donated a special fund to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at the Harvard Medical School in 1999 so that I could start my own laboratory ” says Frangioni. “It was the greatest honor of my career that a world-renowned chemist would see something valuable in the work I trying to do. From his personal experiences  he knew how hard it was for a young scientist to establish a lab from nothing  and without him  it wouldn’t have happened for me. He must have had a crystal ball  though  because I went on to receive over $59 million in grant funding and published over 200 papers in the field of molecular imaging. Dr. Kemp had a rare combination of brilliance and generosity that he shared with the world  and will be sorely missed.”Kemp’s final graduate student  Christian Schubert PhD ’09  was  in many ways  the son Kemp never had. He entered Kemp’s research group as a new immigrant to the United States in 2004  and revered Kemp as a second father. The pair developed a close friendship over the past decade  sharing a sense of family and belonging that Kemp’s life may have otherwise lacked.“Dan’s intellectual brilliance shone so brightly  but his empathy  kindness  and love for all the good in this world  its life  its people and cultures  shone even brighter ” says Schubert. “He approached it all with his full conviction and attention  never arrogant  always kind  empathic  and ready to lend a helping hand. Like all of us  he had his growth edges  of course  but he was keenly aware of them and reflected on them often. His altruism and care stand out from the rich and fulfilled life he lived  and will live on in all of us who were fortunate enough to have called him a mentor and friend. He will be missed  and the world today is less bright than it was with him just yesterday.”Kemp is survived by his legacy as a giant of chemistry and teaching. His close companion of the last 35-plus years  his cockatoo Octavian “Tavvy ” has been placed in loving care.

Ramachandra Dasari  associate director of the GR Harrison Spectroscopy Lab  dies at 87,Ramachandra Rao Dasari  associate director of the GR Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory  which houses the MIT-Laser Biomedical Research Center  passed away peacefully of natural causes  surrounded by family  on April 12. He was 87.Dasari was a member of the MIT community for over 50 years  and was inducted into the Institute’s Half-Century Club in 2017.“Ramachandra’s numerous contributions range from laser science to non-invasive biomedical diagnosis  publishing nearly 400 scientific papers ” says Peter T.C. So  professor of mechanical engineering and biological engineering. “He mentored several generations of MIT students and postdocs who are now leaders in academia and industry. Dr. Dasari was a good friend and will be greatly missed.”Educated in his native India  Dasari earned a bachelor’s degree from Andhra University in 1954  a master’s degree from Benares Hindu University in 1956  and a doctoral degree from Aligarh Muslim University in 1960. Dasari joined the faculty of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)  Kanpur  where he went on to build one of the largest laser laboratories for university research in India  in 1962. During his tenure at IIT  Dasari spent two years (1966-68) as a visiting scientist at MIT  studying the fabrication of lasers and conducting research in laser physics. He left IIT Kanpur in 1978  and spent a year as a visiting senior research officer at the National Research Council of Canada  Ottawa (1978-79)  and another year as a visiting scientist at the Department of Physics  University of British Columbia  Vancouver (1979-80) before coming to MIT permanently in 1980 — first as a visiting professor of physics  and then  in 1981  as a principal research scientist in the GR Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory. He was appointed assistant director of the spectroscopy laboratory in 1984  and was promoted to associate director in 1992. In 2008  Dasari moved to northwest Indiana to be close his family and grandchildren. His work continued  with frequent visits to MIT  until 2017.Over his many decades overseeing the spectroscopy laboratory  Dasari touched the lives of many  and his countless attributes — not the least being his kind demeanor as a patient mentor  his genuine concern for those around him  and his masterful negotiating tactics — will be forever remembered by those who knew him.Adam Wax  now a professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University  worked with Dasari from 1999 to 2002 while conducting postdoctoral research at the spectroscopy laboratory. “Ramachandra was a kind and thoughtful soul who touched the lives of everyone who came through spec lab ” says Wax. “He was also a tough negotiator and kept a watchful eye on everything and everyone in the lab. He lived a long and rich life  and I am very sad that it has come to an end during this difficult time  when we cannot all join together and share his memory.”“Ramachandra was the most considerate person in my life who cared every aspect of people around from research to personal life ” says Wonshik Choi  professor of physics at Korea University and a former visiting student and postdoc. Choi described Dasari’s mentorship as “unforgettable.” “With deep and broad knowledge  he used to identify and support whatever was necessary to break through the gridlock ” remembers Choi.  “His warm spiritual support enabled us to go through all-or-nothing type of tough projects  such as proving the nonclassicality of the single-atom laser radiation  and his enthusiastic inspiration led us to develop exciting label-free cell tomography.”Charles H. Holbrow  emeritus professor of physics at Colgate University and current visiting professor of physics at MIT  met and became friends with Dasari in 1983  when Holbrow arrived at MIT for the first of several visiting professorships. Holbrow credits Dasari with fostering the creativity and productivity of the spectroscopy laboratory  and supporting the lab’s director. The two men extended their friendship to include their families  a connection that Holbrow considers “a memorial to a fine man.”“Ramachandra provided skillful management  expertise in Raman spectroscopy  and important mentoring of graduate students and postdocs — many experiencing America for the first time ” says Holbrow. “He was deeply concerned about their welfare and was a source of personal warmth and helpful guidance. He cared about them  and they knew it. He was also an exceptional negotiator; his work with equipment vendors was an art form. It was a pleasure to watch him persuade salesmen and company managers to reduce prices  provide special services  and give early access to technical innovations and improvements.”Rebecca Richards-Kortum SM ’87  PhD ’90  currently the Malcolm Gillis University Professor of Bioengineering at Rice University  worked with Dasari from 1985 to 1990 and credits him with inspiring his mentees to be better mentors through his actions. “[Dasari] was a great scientist  but he was an especially generous mentor to all the students and staff who worked in the spectroscopy lab ” she says. “Many people relied on him for great career advice. I remember when I was graduating  he sat down with me to think through many options and helped me come to the right choice. As I reached back out over the years  he was always willing to listen and offer wisdom and great advice.”Dasari is survived by Suhasini  his wife of 69 years; his son Satish Dasari and daughter-in-law Veda Praveena; daughter Lakshmi Dasari; and grandchildren  Sidarth and Vivek. In addition to his family  his pride and joy were his students  both at IITK and at MIT  and their success will remain his lasting legacy. Due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines during the Covid-19 crisis  a private service was held on April 14. The family will hold a celebration of his life at a later date  when it is safe to do so.
Remembering Kenneth Keniston  founder of the MIT Program in Science  Technology  and Society,Kenneth Keniston  a founder and pillar of MIT’s Program in Science  Technology  and Society  and later of the MIT-India Program  passed away on Feb. 14 after a long illness. He was 90 years old.Keniston's death serves as a reminder of his decisive role in opening up a broader educational mission for MIT. In the 1970s  MIT was reconsidering its core questions. The life sciences were redefined around the promises and perils of recombinant DNA research. The Department of Electrical Engineering renamed itself the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The School of Humanities and Social Science  as it was then known  took on “a broader educational mission” — a chapter title of the Lewis Report (1949) that called for the establishment of the school. The calamitous first half of the 20th century had shown  in the words of the Lewis Report  that “The most difficult and complicated problems confronting our generation are in the field of the humanities and social sciences.” This conviction was strengthened by the seismic shifts of the 1960s  which stirred the campus with political activism and educational innovation.When Jerome Wiesner and Walter Rosenblith became  respectively  president and provost of MIT in 1971  they believed MIT needed more than a new school to engage with the “most difficult and complicated problems.” While the school gave MIT new capacities in the humanities  social sciences  and arts  it needed robust connections to MIT’s existing strengths in science and engineering. Wiesner and Rosenblith wanted to create a college beyond and above the five existing schools  a college that would serve as a new model for interdisciplinary studies of sociotechnical change.In 1975 Wiesner and Rosenblith invited Kenneth Keniston to play a leadership role in such a college. Keniston was a professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale Medical School and Yale College  well-known in the academy and beyond. A decade earlier he had published "The Uncommitted: Alienated Youth in American Society" (1965)  a widely reviewed and much discussed study of the social psychology of American college students. He was serving as chair and executive director of the Carnegie Council on Children  a major initiative which involved managing multiple scholars  staff  meetings  scholarly publications  and public outreach.Both the book and the study asked big questions. "The Uncommitted" asked: How could a society so wealthy and full of opportunities fail to attract the commitment of its privileged young people? The Carnegie Council on Children asked: How could such a society so wealthy and full of opportunities permit such inequities in life outcomes  most visible among its children?Keniston accepted the invitation to bring to MIT this research record  administrative experience  and focus on important questions.Founder of STSKenneth Keniston was born in 1930 in Chicago. His otherwise conventional education was interrupted when his father  a professor of Spanish literature at the University of Michigan  was assigned to the American embassy in Buenos Aires in 1942 as a way of showing the North American flag there during the war. For 12-year-old Keniston  who knew no Spanish  this brought an unanticipated education in international living  the first of many for him.After the family returned to the United States  Keniston was an academic star. He received his bachelor’s degree magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1951; became a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College  Oxford; and got a doctorate in social studies from Oxford in 1956. He was also a star athlete. At Harvard  Keniston rowed on a famously winning team. As a graduate student  he was the only non-British member of the Oxford crew team that won the 1952 Boat Race with Cambridge  which has gone down in sporting history as one of the most exciting races ever rowed.Keniston returned to Harvard as a junior fellow (1953-56)  lecturing there in clinical psychology. He joined the Yale University faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor of psychology; seven years later he was a full professor and director of the Behavioral Sciences Study Center. In these years he published not only "The Uncommitted" but also companion studies  "Young Radicals: Notes on Committed Youth" (1968) and "Youth and Dissent: The Rise of a New Opposition" (1971).An obvious research track would have involved following this generation as it aged  but this was not his style. Once Keniston had mastered a challenge  he preferred to move to new ones. By then the Carnegie project was underway  and Keniston threw himself into it with intellectual energy and administrative savvy.Similar to his studies of uncommitted youth  the Carnegie project drew upon philosophic as well as scientific literature and achieved a fusion of psychological and sociological perspectives. Most of all  it advocated for the overlooked and marginalized. The Council’s recommendations stressed two persistent concerns: the need to create upward social mobility for all children (especially the handicapped  poor  and minorities)  and the wisdom of giving direct help to parents — getting them more income through full employment and tax credits — rather than indirectly through particular government services and programs. In Keniston’s words “[Parents] are the best thing we have … we don’t have any choice but to try to give the power and resources to parents.”In Keniston’s early years at MIT he was busy writing  editing  publishing  and disseminating the recommendations of the Carnegie Report on Children. In his own research he continued to work on issues related to children’s well-being and also began to do comparative studies of the education  development  and careers of engineers in the United States and in France — projects which took him to major French institutions such as the Ecole des Mines and the Sorbonne (University of Paris).Most of all  Keniston had to turn his attention to his new institutional home. Along with that of Leo Marx  Keniston’s appointment was intended as a first step in the realization of the Wiesner-Rosenblith vision of an interdisciplinary college with a broad focus on sociotechnical change. The vision was not widely shared at MIT. In later years  both Keniston and Marx admitted that at times they felt they had walked into a “lion’s den.” Many faculty in engineering and science were skeptical that this broader mission was a good use of MIT’s resources. Some faculty in humanities and the social sciences agreed with the goal but had different ideas about how and who to implement it.By the late 1970s  the dream had been scaled back. Rather than a college positioned outside of MIT’s already established schools  the new unit emerged as the Program in Science  Technology  and Society (STS)  a department in the School of Humanities and Social Science (now the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences). Though considerably less ambitious than the original vision  even this department was insecure. There were contentious arguments about tenure cases. As the 1980s wore on  MIT leadership was threatening to shut down the unit entirely.In 1986  Keniston became director of the Program in STS. In a den of lions  he proved a skilled lion-tamer. In the words of one faculty colleague  “I remember Ken as saving STS at its most desperate moment.” Others recall that period as one of “circling the wagons” as the STS program fought off a series of attacks. In Keniston’s own  less dramatic words  most of his writing in those years “consisted of memoranda and grant proposals.”Ken understood the MIT power structure and worked it well. He participated in many Institute-wide committees concerned with the educational program. He made sure that the STS program faculty met face to face with the provost. He understood that at MIT a world-class graduate program was essential for institutional respect  and so with other STS faculty he began organizing a doctoral program.The original proposal presented to the SHASS dean called for a graduate program in the history of science and technology; Keniston urged that it be a program in the historyand social studies of science and technology. This broader graduate program was launched in 1988  with the Institute providing one graduate student stipend. Along with other STS colleagues  Keniston set about raising money to fund more students. He was able to tap foundation support  which provided not only more stipends but also more respect from the rest of MIT.It had been years since Ken Keniston rowed crew  but he had not forgotten how effective teamwork can be. He was a strong leader who was also a strong collaborator. He was not promoting himself  nor even promoting STS in and of itself. His commitment was to its mission. What he cared about — what had brought him to MIT in the first place — was developing institutional capacity to bring the humanities and social sciences to bear on the most difficult questions of the time.In answering those questions  he advocated a broad understanding of the social sciences  believing that they could be rigorous without necessarily being quantitative. His scholarly openness helped younger faculty find an institutional home here. Sherry Turkle  for example  felt that as a young scholar Keniston understood her goals even more clearly than she herself did. He told her that her first book (“Psychoanalytic Politics”) had raised a universal issue: “There are revolutions of the heart and of the mind and of the economic system. Sorting these out are eternal questions and you have made a contribution here.” Keniston encouraged her and many others to address such “eternal questions” and to build a scholarly home for them at MIT.A passage to IndiaKeniston served in STS leadership positions for a decade  as program director from 1986 to 1992 and as director of graduate studies from 1992 to 1996. During this period he continued to collaborate with colleagues in teaching  while also collaborating with Leo Marx and Jill Conway on a major research project in the still-emergent field of environmental studies (resulting in the publication in 2000 of "Earth  Air  Fire  Water: Humanistic Studies of the Environment " co-edited by the three of them).In 1997 Keniston traveled to India to attend a meeting sponsored by Microsoft about the challenges of developing software in a country with so many local written and spoken languages. He became fascinated by this problem and more generally by the gap between technological and human development in India. He had tried to understand this gap between promise and reality in American children and youth; now he was trying to understand this phenomenon in a dense  complex society on the other side of the globe.How could a country with the capacities of India — its booming software industry  its accomplishments in space exploration and nuclear power  its large middle class — also suffer from severe shortcomings in human development (a third of the population going to bed hungry  a half of its population illiterate)? In Keniston’s own words  “India does — or could — lead the world in creating both the technologies for reaching ordinary people and the grass-roots social experiments that could teach both India and other nations how to use those technologies for the common good.”To understand these technologies and social experiments  Keniston used methods he had well-honed through years of research. He developed a network of support among Indians in key positions  serving as a visiting professor at leading Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) at Chennai  Mumbai  and Kanpur  and joining governing boards  notably that of the National Institute of Advanced Studies at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. He sought and received support from private companies and foundations such as the Ford Foundation and the Microsoft Research Center in India.He also trudged through many a village to learn about facts on the ground. He was struck by the number of village projects in which technologies were used for information and communication — and by the dearth of studies of their impact on human development. He wanted to know how the technologies were serving the causes of economic development  political transparency  and social justice.To answer this fundamental question  Keniston identified around 50 such projects of community development and studied 20 of them. He loved to interview  making sure to include everyone  in his own words  “from the outcasts to the Brahmins.” He reviewed the promise and performance of various projects with what one Indian colleague described as a “skeptical yet interested eye.” For example  he noted the role of community information centers in putting land sale records on-line; this opened up land sales to those people previously excluded by lack of information  but it also enabled some canny operators to manipulate land sales as never before. He also recognized early on that cellphones were a critical tool in creating agricultural supply chains and other marketing opportunities in rural India.Keniston’s years of research led to empirically based conclusions about what types of IT interventions are useful in the larger context of how much they cost  and who pays  and who benefits. These results were published in books such as "IT Experience in India: Bridging the Digital Divide" (2004)  co-authored with Deepak Kumar; "The State  IT  and Development" (2005)  co-authored with Rohit Raj Mathur and R.K. Bagga; and a comparative study of rural information projects for the Government of India (2006)  authored with V. Balaji  as well as in dozens of articles  chapters  and lectures.The most lasting effect of these many research visits  however  lay in the realm of human relations. Keniston’s personality made an indelible impression. He was the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Human Development at MIT who was also an engaging human being. As one professor at IITBangalore explained  “He combined intellectual authority with a warmth and personal approachability and empathy in a manner that is rare.”This mix of admiration and affection is shared by many of Keniston’s Indian colleagues  some of whom describe him as “fatherly.” They appreciated his collaborative manner  supporting and encouraging Indians engaged in village studies. Keniston’s graduate student Richa Kumar  now on the faculty of the IITDelhi as an associate professor of sociology and policy studies  says that he changed her life: “He picked me out from the villages of Madurai and got me to MIT!”Conversely  Ken Keniston made it possible to send many MIT students to the villages of India. From his earliest visits he made a point of meeting MIT alumni there. In 1998  just one year after the Microsoft meeting  Keniston founded the MIT-India Program as a component of the MIT Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program. MISTI was just at the take-off point from a small operation  with no central funding  to the much larger  more robust  and more broadly supported organization of today.The MIT-India Program started off modestly enough  with Keniston recruiting MIT undergraduates to teach coding to Indian high school students. From the beginning  the goal was to provide MIT students with the opportunity of being at the forefront of India’s science  technology  and innovation activities  while also allowing them to experience the country’s history and culture. For this reason  before going to India  interns had to take a seminar introducing them to Indian history  culture  economics  and politics  as well as practical issues of travel  health  and hospitality. Keniston taught this MIT-India seminar and also a first-year advisor seminar  which helped introduce new students to the opportunity.The MIT-India Program grew rapidly under Ken’s leadership. In 1999 he visited intern sites in Bangalore  Bombay  North Bombay Poona  and Jamshedpur  in each location meeting with interns and their supervisors. The following year  18 MIT students interned in eight different sites. In the early 2000s the program expanded to include multiple internships for MIT students in Indian research centers  multinational companies  universities  startups  and non-profits  as well as other research and teaching opportunities.In recent years  the program has sent 40 to 50 students  both undergraduate and graduate  from all MIT schools  for summer internships. In its first 20 years  MIT-India sent more than 1 000 MIT students to India. The growth of this program is both cause and effect of a growing appreciation of international experience that has revolutionized MIT education in the last generation.A transformative presenceWhen Keniston came to MIT in 1975  it was not an obvious move for him or for MIT. He had been educated at Harvard and Yale; he was not an engineer  and not a physical scientist. The only home he had at MIT was the one he was supposed to help create. He was moving into an academic environment that was unfamiliar and not especially welcoming.But he brought with him enormous gifts: He was sophisticated  accomplished  well-connected  well-read  urbane  witty  irreverent. He was refined but also had a lively sense of humor and personal warmth. In the words of STS colleague and former SHASS Dean Deborah Fitzgerald  whom he hired in 1988  “He tried hard to act like a regular person but it was clear he was not.”MIT changed Keniston. He found ways to meld his research interests with the STS mission. He learned to navigate his way in an unfamiliar academic terrain. He collaborated with new sets of people from around the world. He had to work with many people who did not see the point of an STS program or an international learning program. At MIT  Keniston evolved in ways that he probably would not have if he had stayed on a more predictable track.And because he did  Keniston changed MIT  too. He was crucial in launching an STS program with the highest standards in addressing “the most difficult and complicated problems facing humanity.” Those problems have become only more numerous  difficult  and complicated  and MIT has come to understand that addressing them is a matter for the entire Institute. If MIT did not now have an STS program  it would be scrambling to create one.The MIT-India Program too is flourishing  as is international learning more generally. Much earlier and more deeply than many others  Keniston understood that MIT’s long association with India is not a “technology transfer” relationship but a reciprocal  evolving relationship of people  cultures  and knowledge in the cause of human development. Again  if MIT did not already have the MIT-India program  we would be hard at work to create something like it.Kenneth Keniston played a major role in encouraging MIT to ask new questions that have significantly broadened MIT’s educational mission in the 21st century. His presence was transformative and he will be deeply missed.
Professor Emeritus Arnold Demain  a pioneer in the development of antibiotics  dies at 92 ,Arnold Lester Demain  professor emeritus of biology  passed away on Apr. 3 at the age of 92 from complications due to Covid-19. He was just shy of celebrating his 93rd birthday.Demain advanced the field of fermentation biology  and made major contributions to the study of antibiotics like penicillin  cephalosporin  and beta-lactam. Over the course of his 60-year career  he made a name for himself as one of the world’s leading industrial microbiologists  and mentored hundreds of budding scientists around the world.“Arny was a prolific industrial biologist  as well as a colleague and friend ” says Alan Grossman  head of the Department of Biology and the Praecis Professor of Biology. “His work on antibiotic fermentations spurred a new wave. He was kind and supportive to all  and a dedicated mentor to many students and postdocs.”Demain was born on April 26  1927 in Brooklyn  New York  and grew up during the Great Depression. He graduated from high school at the age of 16  and attended Michigan State College (now Michigan State University). At 17  he put his education on pause to join the U.S. Navy and fight in World War II. After the war ended  he returned to Michigan State and resumed his studies  earning his bachelor’s degree in 1949 and his master’s in microbiology in 1950  with a focus on food fermentation — specifically  how pickles spoil. During this time  Demain met his wife Joanna (Kaye) Demain  and they were married on August 2  1952.Demain began his PhD in food science at the University of California at Berkeley  but relocated to Davis when that campus opened. Under the guidance of his research advisor and prominent yeast scholar  Herman Jan Phaff  Demain studied the degradation of pectic acid by an extracellular enzyme in the yeastKlyveromyces fragilis  publishing four papers  including one inNature. Demain and Phaff were also among the first researchers to perform affinity chromatography  which later became a standard biochemical procedure.After earning his PhD in 1954  Demain was recruited by Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories  first to research penicillin biosynthesis and later to study cephalosporin C. In 1965  he established Merck’s Fermentation Microbiology Department.After 16 years at Merck  Demain joined MIT’s former Department of Nutrition and Food Science  and in 1988 he joined the Department of Biology. When he first arrived  no one at MIT was conducting research on antibiotics. He was eager to continue investigating penicillins and cephalosporins  and his hard work culminated in the breakthrough discovery of a key enzyme in cephalosporin biosynthesis: deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase.Rich Losick PhD ’69 was finishing his graduate work at MIT when Demain arrived on campus. Demain later interacted with Losick’s wife Janice Pero and former postdoc John Perkins because all three shared an interest in vitamin B2 research. “I was drawn to Arny due to his warm and engaging personality and my interest in microbiology ” Losick recalls. “He pioneered industrial production of vitamins  antibiotics  and fine chemicals  and was revered for his many contributions to industrial microbiology. He was a big-hearted human being  an excellent and productive scientist  and a dedicated teacher. He will be greatly missed.”While at MIT  Demain also helped catalyze the biotech industry by serving as the founding consultant for the biotech company  Cetus Corporation. By the mid-1990s  he’d spearheaded a series of NASA-sponsored experiments to probe the effects of simulated microgravity on secondary metabolism. Toward the end of his 32 years at MIT  he began examiningClostridium tetaniandClostridium difficilebacteria in hopes of devising tetanus and antibiotic-associated diarrhea vaccines. He ultimately authored more than 500 publications and 21 U.S. patents.“Arny had a keen mind and a gentle disposition that put you at ease ” says Gerald Fink  professor in the Department of Biology and founding member and former director of the Whitehead Institute. When Fink started at MIT  Demain was the first to greet him. “He dropped into my office in Building 56 and he said  ‘You are going to like it here ’” Fink recalls.“Arny was a wonderful colleague ” adds Robert Sauer  the Salvador E. Luria Professor of Biology. “He was always upbeat and happy to talk about science or anything else on your mind.”Professor of Biology Anthony Sinskey shared an office with Demain  and remembers him as a pioneer who applied genetics and biochemistry to improve antibiotic production processes. He says Demain was instrumental in forming important interdisciplinary programs at MIT — including using anaerobic microorganisms to convert cellulose to fuels  as well as strategies for cell free synthesis of antibiotics and other projects.“I learned a tremendous amount from our interactions ” Sinskey says. “He taught industrial microbiology and fermentation technology to hundreds of students both at MIT and from industry.”While Demain was at MIT  an informal group of students formed called Arny’s Army and Friends. Since his “early” retirement from MIT at age 75  Demain’s students have held the Arny’s Army and Friends Symposia in his honor every three years.Later  Demain would recall that he “was very lucky ... to have had a fantastic group of bright and hardworking visiting scientists  postdoctoral associates  graduate students  undergraduate students and high school students. ... Success at MIT would not have been possible without them.”Abraham L. “Linc” Sonenshein first crossed paths with Demain as a graduate student at MIT. From the beginning  Sonenshein could tell Demain was “a very important scientist to interact with ” because of the way he applied his knowledge of microbiology to prevent and treat infections. “I was amazed that he continued to contribute to science publication and training for decades after officially retiring as a full-time faculty member ” Sonenshein says. “The number of scientists he educated and trained is phenomenal.”In 2000  Demain moved to Madison  New Jersey  and joined the Research Institute for Scientists Emeriti (RISE) at Drew University. He continued to conduct research and mentor students until May 2019  when he fully retired at the age of 92. That same year  Drew University established an endowed scholarship in his name.Over the course of his career  Demain earned numerous awards  including one from the king of Spain and another from the emperor of Japan. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences  president of the Society for Industrial Microbiology  and on the Board of Governors for the American Academy of Microbiology.He is survived by his wife of 68 years  Joanna (Jody) Demain; his daughter  Pamela Demain; his son  Jeffrey Demain; his daughter-in-law  Lauren Brener; his grandchildren; and his great-grandchildren. A memorial service for family  friends  colleagues  and former students will be held when it is safe to do so. Donations in his memory can be made to theAlzheimer's Foundation of America.
Professor Emeritus Ulrich Becker  who made major contributions to particle physics  dies at 81,Ulrich J. Becker  a professor emeritus in the Department of Physics  passed away on March 10 at age 81  after a long struggle with cancer.Becker became emeritus in 2011 after 42 years with MIT  but he never really retired; he continued to mentor students in his fourth-floor Grad Lab until shortly before he died.Known to many as Uncle Bravo  Becker used his engineering talents and endless curiosity to discover elementary particles in his pursuit of the secrets of the universe. Becker’s career in experimental high-energy physics included key contributions to the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the J particle. He was also a major contributor to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station  the advancement of international collaborations in high-energy physics  and other instruments and discoveries that impacted high-energy physics research.“Ulrich Becker was a gifted physicist who made major contributions to particle physics ” saysSamuel C.C. Ting  the Thomas Dudley Cabot Institute Professor of Physics at MIT. “Over more than half a century of collaboration  I found him to be an exceptional physicist not only in the invention of precision instruments but  most importantly  in that he had good taste in physics.”Early lifeUlrich Becker was born in Dortmund  Germany  on Dec. 17  1938. On that day nuclear fissionwas discovered in Berlin. Just a few months before  Germany reissued to its Jewish citizens passports stamped with the red letter "J ” and launched theKristallnachtpogrom.During World War II  Becker  with his brother Peter and parents Auguste (Bühner) and Georg Becker  took shelter in the basement of their apartment building while bombs fell overhead.After the war  his father ran a laboratory supply business in Dortmund and would send the teenage Ulrich on deliveries. “He learned a lot of dirty secrets of industry like planned obsolescence ” says his daughter  Katharina Becker  and that left him disillusioned. He tried his hand as a coal miner  a steelworker  and an electrician  but he was also good at math and science.“He started thinking about why would something as awful as World War II happen  and why so many were killed  and the inequity of it all — why did it have to be that terrible?” says his daugher  Katharina Becker. “In the end it was an existential question: Why would God let war happen?” Raised as a Lutheran  Becker decided that if he studied physics  he might be able to ask God a few of these questions.After graduating from the University of Marburg  Becker pursued his PhD at the University of Hamburg  focusing on the photo-production and leptonic decays of vector mesons. He was able to show that all vector-mesons behave like heavy photons  that they displayed diffraction and converted back to virtual photons.The Nobel pursuitIn 1964  physicists proposed the concept of the subatomic particles known as quarks. These fundamental particles and corresponding antiparticles bind together to form other particles  like protons and neutrons. There were three types of quarks — up  down  and strange — while the proposed fourth  the charm quark  remained a theory.Samuel Ting was leading an experiment at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) Laboratory in Hamburg  Germany when he met doctoral candidate Becker in fall 1965. The group was using the 6 billion electron volt synchrotron light to measure the size of the electron. Ting decided to sponsor Becker's research  so he joined the group. “He made important contributions to the data analysis of this experiment ” recalled Ting.It was a complementary match: Becker was a dogged researcher  and Ting was a master in organization and politics.They presented their results at the XIIIth International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966. The results showed that electrons have no measurable size  which contradicted earlier results from both theCambridgeElectron Acceleratorand Cornell University.Becker then completed his PhD under mentor Peter Stähelin  founder of DESY and co-founder of CERN  and remained at DESY to study the photoproduction and leptonic decays of vector mesons.In 1970  Becker joined the MIT faculty  counting among his mentorsVictor WeisskopfandMartin Deutsch  and was promoted to associate professor in 1973  and full professor in 1977. The following year he joined the team of Glenn Everhart  Terry Rhoades  and Min Chen at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to design a precision spectrometer. “He developed high-precision  radiation-resistant proportional chambers which operated at a very low voltage in order to function smoothly in a high radiation environment at rates of 20 MHz ” says Ting.Ting’s group used the spectrometer in their experiment  smashing protons into a fixed target of beryllium to produce heavy particles that would then decay into electrons and positrons. They were hoping to find heavy particles. Instead  they produced an unexpected curve in the data.Becker and Ting worked day and night to process the data  to figure out what they had actually found: A heavy particle with a lifetime that was about a thousand times longer than predicted.“We had no idea why the hell this was ” Becker said in a 2014MIT Technology Reviewinterview. “We were highly suspicious of it  but since it was so clear cut  there was very little room for doubt.”Becker recalled that the announcement of what they found had been delayed  due to budget and disbelief. “Brookhaven couldn’t pay their electric bill  and I had to ask Martin Deutsch for $30 000 so they could pay the bill. He flatly refused. And then he said I had to give a seminar  so I gave a seminar in October 1974  and we had the data that showed the peak at 3.1 GeV.”Becker’s first round of findings was in September to early October  but “it wasn’t something we had been expecting ” Becker recalled. They were confirmed later that October  and Becker pasted one of the graphs on top of another. (Becker held onto this graph  and later  when he moved into his Grad Lab  he hung these breakthrough results on his display case.)“Ulrich showed up at the Center for Theoretical Physics excited  in his Germanic way  with two graphs: one with a sharp peak and the other with a broad one ” recalls Robert L. Jaffe  Morningstar Professor of Physics and MacVicar Faculty Fellow at MIT. “He was explaining that one graph showed their data on electron-positron-pair production at BNL and the other showed the pair-autocorrelation function. I  of course  assumed that the sharp peak was the autocorrelation function and the broad  relatively uninteresting one was the enhancement in the electron-positron mass distribution. It took a few minutes for me to figure out that the situation was the reverse and that the electron-positron pair enhancement was narrower than the experimental resolution. Ulrich smiled broadly. My jaw dropped and the world was never quite the same!”Meanwhile  Burton Richter ’52  PhD ’56  was reviewing measurements of collisions of electrons and positrons at Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory’s particle collider when he too found something surprising: a heavy particle with an unusually long lifetime.Ting flew to Stanford that November and ran into Richter. After discussing their results  they quickly organized a lab seminar  presented their results on Nov. 11  1974  and published their findings  separately  in the same issue ofPhysical Review Letters.In early 1975  Becker went to Germany for a talk about their result. He recalled toTechnology Reviewthat theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg interrupted his talk to comment  “Whenever they don’t know what it is  they invent a new quark.” To which Becker replied  “Look  Professor Heisenberg  I’m not arguing whether this is charm or not charm. I’m telling you it’s a particle which doesn’t go away.’ Dead silence. It got very cold in the room. Then Heisenberg said  ‘Accepted.’”What followed were rapid changes inhigh-energy physics  which became known as the "November Revolution." Physicists decided that the J/Ψ consisted of one charm quark and one anti-charm quark. It also created structure and predictability for fundamental particles  which physicists dubbed theStandard Model.Ting’s group called the new particle “J ” which is one letter away from "K " the name of the “strange” meson; "J" also resembles the Chinese character for Ting's name. Richter’s group called it “Ψ” (psi).The discovery led to Ting and Richter sharing the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1976. According to Nobel rules  only three people at most can win for any single discovery  and if Ting's colleagues at MIT had tried to nominate a collaborator from the Ting team  then Richter’s colleagues at Stanford would have wanted to nominate a colleague from their team.“If only one of the groups — MIT — discovered it  I am convinced Becker would have been included in the Nobel Prize for it ” says Wit Busza  Francis Friedman Professor of Physics Emeritus and MacVicar Faculty Fellow at MIT  who had worked with Ting’s team alongside Becker in Hamburg.When asked recently about missing out on the Nobel Prize  Becker just shrugged. “That’s what happens.”In the late 1970s  one of Becker’s chambers that he had designed for the J particle experiment was exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution.His passion for discovery led him to build detectors and run other experiments at DESY  Brookhaven  MIT  and CERN. “He just wanted to get to the bottom of things ” says his daughter.“He was not in the limelight  he was very modest ” saysBoleslaw Wyslouch  director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. “He had a deep knowledge of particle physics  having contributed himself to some of the most important discoveries. His main contribution was to build the detectors that worked extremely well in experiments that led to major discoveries.”Getting the driftBecker developed several other major instruments widely used in experimental particle physics  and that were the catalyst for many major discoveries.His large-area drift chamber would provide large acceptance coverage for experiments  and his drift tubes enabled physicists to measure particles near the interaction point. Those developments led to Becker to design and build the huge muon detectors for the MARK-J experiment at DESY  which resulted in the discovery of the three-jet pattern from gluon production.This led to his leading hundreds of colleagues in designing themuon detector  one of three main outer layers of theL3 detector  one of four largedetectorson theLarge Electron-Positron collider(LEP)  at CERN  to study the electro-weak interference. The outer layer of the L3 detector held a magnet that generated a field 10 000 times stronger than the average field on the Earth's surface. L3 started data taking in 1989 and stopped in 2000  to be replaced by theLarge Hadron Collider. “The results from L3 provided accurate confirmation of theStandard Model ” says Ting.He also made important contributions to advancing international collaboration in high-energy physics.“The readiness of Professor Becker to help in training our colleagues  his deep understanding of the Mark-J experiment and his superb teaching skills deserves our highest recognition ” saysManuel Aguilarof the Centre for Energy  Environment and Technology. “His friendly approach  his behavior and deep understanding of physics  made all of us to feel very comfortable  and that is something we did most appreciate and will never forget.”In 1978  Becker went to China to select 18 young physicists to work with the MIT group. This was the first group of young Chinese physics students to work outside China after the Cultural Revolution. Many of them went on to lead the Chinese high-energy physics research program and launch an international collaboration.“Professor Becker was an old friend of Chinese high-energy physicists ” says Institute of High Energy Physics PhysicistHesheng ChenPhD ’84  who was mentored by Becker for 40 years. “He taught and advised many Chinese physicists to do the Mark-J experiment and the L3 experiment.”Alpha Magnetic SpectrometerBecker also worked with professor of physics and department headPeter Fisher  and MITElectromagnetic Interactions Group senior research scientistsJoseph BurgerandMichael Capell  among others on building an Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). This was another Ting project  which aimed to record the tracks of millions of cosmic ray particles  the debris released by explosions in distant stars.The idea for the AMSwas born while Becker and Ting were on a coffee break while working on the L3. "We sat in Building 44 and thought  'How can we prove or disprove the prejudice that there is only matter?' One anti-carbon nucleus could change our whole perception of the universe " Becker said toMIT News. The idea was to search for anti-matter  but because anti-matter is destroyed in Earth’s atmosphere  the research would need to be done in space."I had this dream to build an experiment that would have fewer than 100 collaborators and could fit on a table " Becker toldNature. NASA greenlighted the project  but it ballooned to 500 scientists from 56 institutions  and would need a vastly larger table. Its 0.86-tesla magnetic field is 17 000 times bigger than Earth's. "Sam Ting doesn't like to do small things " said Becker.The first AMS cosmic ray detector flew in the STS-91 shuttle payload in June 1998 and gathered about 100 hours of data. The first large magnet experiment ever placed in the Earth's orbit  the AMS's instrumentation allowed researchers to measure higher-energy particles with greater accuracy. Becker was alternately excited and mystified by the results: 100 million particles were detected with four times as many positrons as electrons showing up near the Earth's magnetic equator. But not a  single anti-carbon nucleus was found.Becker then went on to help design the transition radiation detector for Ting’sAMS-02  which sought to conduct a more extensive search for rare cosmic ray particles while mounted on theInternational Space Stationin May 2011. In March 2013  Ting reported initial results  saying that AMS had observed over 400 000positrons. By March 2020  AMS had collected over 155 billion cosmic ray events.Becker never did set up his own research group  choosing instead to spend nearly his entire career collaborating with Ting. “They had an incredible  very complementary interaction ” says Busza. “Ting is brilliant when it comes to judgment  organization  political skills  and obtaining funding. While Becker is brilliant in the design and building of experiments  in instrumentation and analysis of data. As a result of both of those people  their research program has been extraordinarily successful.”In 2002  Becker received a NASA Recognition Letter for “Success in the First AMS Flight” and in 2006 was named a fellow of the American Physical Society.Says Ting  “Professor Ulrich Becker was a person of integrity and a good friend.” Adds Busza  “For Ulrich  physics was an essential part of life.”A mentor to manyBecker was a mentor to many talented physicists  including thesis advisor to MIT’s Wyslouch  Capell  andJoseph A. Paradiso  andReyco Henningfrom the University of North Carolina. “Ulrich was a mentor of mine  and to many of us ” notes Peter Fisher.“He was extremely friendly but also very stern ” says Wyslouch.“I would have never called him by his first name. I think once I called him Ulrich  and it just didn’t work. Professor Becker exuded authority.” Wyslouch recalled trying to score “some brownie points” with his professor by spending weekends repairing a 1974 Datsun. “He really appreciated students who liked to build things and use their hands.”Wyslouch had also worked with Becker for 10 years in Ting’s group. “He just knew everything  he had this approach to things  to check things very quickly  calculate things very quickly  we were always in awe of his knowledge and his experience ” he says. “He was a very good manager of people.”Former studentTeresa Fazio’02 recalls his patience. “I can hear him saying  ‘Och  Teresa. This is not good ’ when I had written particularly boneheaded or incorrect things in my thesis. When someone reported an experiment had failed or equipment didn't work or something from Aachen or CERN was late  his typical response was  "Oh  well... Next?" Considering some of the things that went wrong  he remained remarkably chill.” She also recalled him adjourning his Friday afternoon journal club every week by saying  "So  we go for beer?"Students recalled that his idea of lab shoes were Birkenstocks and socks  and memorably  the time he fed a stray dog that turned out to be a coyote. Students also joined him in kayaking trips and were invited to his house for pizza and his wife Gerda's rhubarb tarts.In 2013 Becker transitioned to emeritus status  but despite his battle with blood clots and prostate cancer  he came in every day to mentor students in his meticulously created fourth-floor Grad Lab that held many abandoned experiments and broken equipment  which he had rescued for repair and demonstration. At the age of 81  he even learned Python.The Department of Physics recently held an informal ceremony where Becker officially handed over the keys to his lab. “After that  he got sick ” recalls his daughter.Ulrich Becker is survived by his wife Gerda (Barthel)  children Katharina  Peter  and Robert  and grandchildren Jarin and Hannah.The physics department will host a memorial service at a date to be announced. The family has requested that donations in his memory may be made to theAmerican Cancer Society.
Thomas Dupree  professor emeritus of nuclear science and engineering and physics  dies at 86,Thomas H. Dupree  a professor emeritus in both the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and the Department of Physics  passed away on Feb. 11 at the age of 86.Focusing on theoretical plasma physics  Dupree was well-known for studying plasma turbulence in terms of coherent structures. Understanding plasma’s unpredictable behavior has been a continuing challenge in the pursuit of fusion energy. Dupree’s articles published in the 1980s and 90s continue to be cited in support of current research.Professor of nuclear science and engineering Ian Hutchinson remembers Dupree as highly regarded among plasma scientists: “He gained a reputation throughout the plasma community as having formidable powers of algebra and analytic theory. He was driven by the intellectual challenge of these very deep theoretical questions.”Born in Santa Monica  California  in 1933  Dupree began his career at MIT as an undergraduate  completing his BS in 1955 and his PhD in physics in 1960. He joined the MIT faculty in 1961  receiving his double appointment as full professor in 1969.Professor emeritus of nuclear science and engineering Kent Hansen met Dupree as a fellow undergraduate physics major at MIT  maintaining a friendship with him through graduate school and later as a professional colleague. He remembers the young Dupree as “very bright  very well-spoken  very reserved but engaged  with a good sense of humor ” as well as being “a superb tennis player.” The two friends acted as ushers for each other’s weddings.Dupree married Andrea Kundsin in 1961. They met at a mixer for students from MIT and Wellesley College  where Kundsin was studying astronomy. She would later earn a PhD in astrophysics from Harvard University  and serve as president of the American Astronomical Society  as well as associate director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.Dupree’s teaching abilities were honored in 1987 with an MIT Graduate Student Council Teaching Award. He retired from teaching one year later at the age of 55  though he continued to do research.In parallel with his academic career  Dupree was engaged in real estate development with his brother  Fred. Their first project in 1962 was 1010 Memorial Drive in Cambridge  Massachusetts  a now-iconic residential tower on the banks of the Charles River. He and his wife lived there themselves until they needed more room for a growing family. Their son  Tom Jr.  was born in 1970 and their daughter  Catherine  in 1973.Thomas Dupree is survived by his wife  son  and daughter  and his four grandchildren: Andrew  Caroline  Aoife  and Lochlann. The family has requested that donations in Thomas Dupree’s memory may be made to the MIT Department of Physics.
Richard Dudley  professor emeritus of mathematics  dies at 81,Richard Mansfield Dudley  MIT professor emeritus of mathematics  died on Jan. 19 following a long illness. He was 81. Dudley served on the MIT mathematics faculty from 1967 until 2015  when he officially retired. Over the course of those 48 years  during which he published over 100 articles as well as numerous books and monographs  he made fundamental breakthroughs in the theory of stochastic process and the general theory of weak convergence.Dudley’s work  starting in the 1960s  shaped the fields of probability  mathematical statistics  and machine learning  with highly influential contributions to the theory of Gaussian processes and empirical processes. What is now widely known as “Dudley’s entropy bound” has become a standard tool of modern research in probability  statistics  and machine learning. Dudley’s work also had a transformative impact on the theory of empirical processes initiated by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis in the context of machine learning. Over a series of papers  starting with his landmark paper “Central limit theorems for empirical processes” (Annals of Probability  1978) and culminating with his influential Saint-Flour lecture notes (1984) and later  his book “Uniform Central Limit Theorems”(Cambridge University Press  1999)  Dudley distilled and developed these ideas into an actionable theory that still today is the reference framework in mathematical statistics and statistical learning theory. The larger communities of probability and statistics remember his excellent taste for mathematically rich and impactful subjects  as well as his highest standard of rigor.Dudley gave a number of distinguished research talks. He was an invited speaker at the 1974 International Congress of Mathematicians as well as at meetings of the American Mathematical Society  the Institute of Mathematical Statistics  and the Bernoulli society. He was also an invited lecturer at Saint-Flour probability summer school in probability in 1982 and several of the Vilnius Conferences on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics. He was a regular participant and organizer of several conferences and meetings  including Probability in Banach Spaces.In 1976  Dudley visited the University of Aarhus  and there produced a set of graduate lecture notes  “Probabilities and Metrics.” These were to become a part of his graduate text  “Real Analysis and Probability ”published by Wadsworth  Inc. in 1989. An early review of this work in theLondon Mathematical Society Bulletin(July 1990) found that it “could be compared to the appearance of Breiman or Loève's classic probability texts.” The text has since become a standard  and in 2002 was reissued by Cambridge University Press and continues to be in print.Dudley was always highly regarded as a graduate mentor throughout his career. He advised 33 PhD candidates (32at MIT)  yielding some 105 academic “descendants.”Dudley served the scholarly community as associate editor (1972-78) and then chief editor (1979-81) ofAnnals of Probability. He was a member of the editorial board of theWadsworth/Brooks/Cole Advanced Series in Statistics/Probabilityfrom 1982 to 1992. For many years while on the MIT faculty  Dudley worked with the MIT Science Library in overseeing their collection of mathematical journals. He sought to explain to the faculty how the library's budget decisions were reached  to help them effectively express their research needs.Among his honors  Dudley was an Alfred P. Sloan Research fellow from 1966-68 and Guggenheim Foundation Fellow in 1991. He was selected to serve on the honorary Advisory Board of Stochastic Processes and their Applications from 1987-2001. In 1993  Dudley was elected a fellow of the American Statistical Association  “for world-recognized contributions to probability theory with far-reaching consequences for statistics  for founding the modern theory of empirical processes  and for dedication to many successful PhD students.” He was also elected fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics  the American Association for theAdvancement of Science  and the American Mathematical Society and was selected to be a member of the International Statistical Institute.Born on July 28  1938  in Cleveland  Ohio  Dudley completed a BA from Harvard University  summa cum laude  in 1959. He wrote a doctoral dissertation under two advisors at Princeton University  Gilbert A. Hunt and Edward Nelson  completing his PhD in mathematics in 1962. He was an instructor at the University of California at Berkley in 1962-63  and an assistant professor from 1963 to 1967  before moving to MIT.Dudley is survived by his wife  Elizabeth (Liza) Martin; his sisters  Edith D. Sylla and Alice D. Carmel; brother-in-law Richard E. Sylla; and nieces Anne Sylla  Margaret S. Padua  and Genevieve Carmel.Memorial contributions may be made in Dudley's name to theEnvironmental Defense Fundor toPartners in Health.
Frank Press  MIT geophysicist and U.S. science adviser  dies at 95,Frank Press  a noted geophysicist and science adviser to four U.S. presidents  died Jan. 29 in Chapel Hill  North Carolina. He was 95.Press  an MIT Corporation life member emeritus  was the chair of the MIT Department of Geology and Geophysics (renamed in 1969 as the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences  and currently the Department of Earth  Atmospheric  and Planetary Sciences  or EAPS) from 1965 to 1977 and later returned to MIT for a short period as an Institute Professor. He is credited with major advances in geophysical research into the structure of the Earth’s interior  lunar and planetary science  earthquake seismology  and seismic wave propagation.“Frank Press was a giant ” says EAPS department head Robert van der Hilst  “and of monumental importance for earth sciences at MIT.”“Frank was an inspiration to a whole generation of geophysicists and will be remembered for his science  humanity  and mentorship ” says Professor Emeritus M. Nafi Toksöz  who was once one of Press’ graduate students.The son of Jewish immigrants from what is now Belarus  Press came to science partly through a childhood love of experimenting  using parts he and his friends scavenged in junkyards near their Brooklyn neighborhood. As a child  he also read voraciously  includingThe New York Times  which his older brothers brought home each day.According to a1997 interviewwith the American Institute of Physics (AIP)  Press’ early performance in school was not auspicious  however. Luckily for the world of science  that changed when he was about 11.“I wasn’t very smart in school until the sixth grade ” Press told the AIP.“What happened?” the interviewer asked.“I got a pair of glasses. I couldn’t see the blackboard ” Press answered with a laugh.In high school in New York City  Press took a geology class in which the teacher gave him a magnetometer and told him to do a magnetic survey of Van Cortland Park in the Bronx. It was on that day that Press decided on his career path.“That really got me ” Press told the AIP. “Because here’s a way I could do physics … and be an explorer.Press went on to earn his bachelor’s degree in physics at City College of New York and a PhD in geophysics from Columbia University. At Columbia  he studied with renowned earth scientist Maurice Ewing  and together they developed the Press-Ewing seismograph.In 1955  Press became director of the Seismological Labory at Caltech  where he succeeded lab founder Beno Gutenberg and worked with seismologists Hugo Benioff and Charles Richter. It was during his time at Caltech that Press began consulting for the federal government  mainly using seismic equipment for the detection of nuclear explosions. Press served on presidential advisory boards starting during the Kennedy Administration and  in 1963  he proposed improving the worldwide seismic station network to bolster that year’s Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.In 1965  Press came to MIT as head of the Department of Geology and Geophysics  partly to go beyond seismology and build a broad geophysics department  including by collaborating with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and helping to form theMIT-WHOI joint program.“I felt I could do better at MIT  as a new person  making it a condition of taking the job that we do certain things ” Press said in a1993 interviewhe provided for the Caltech archives. “I needed a new challenge — I could get it at MIT.”MIT Professor Emeritus B. Clark Burchfiel calls Press “one of the most influential members of our faculty ” who put the EAPS department on its current path. “He was a good friend  and we will miss him ” Burchfiel says.Having continued to serve on science advisory boards during the Johnson and Nixon administrations  Press received a call in 1977 from President Jimmy Carter  who asked him to become the White House science adviser. Press accepted  also becoming director of the newly established Office of Science and Technology Policy.In that role  Press worked to ensure that the United States remained the leader in scientific research  at the same time fostering international alliances and scientific cooperation.“Cooperation among scientific communities in all countries will become even more important in the years ahead as the problems we face increasingly will transcend national boundaries ”The New York Timesquoted Press as saying in 1978.As Press’ son  William Press  toldThe New York Times  one of his father’s proudest achievements as Carter’s science adviser was paving the way for students to come to U.S. universities from Communist China. The expansion of this initiative was the immediate result of a 3 a.m. phone call by Press to the White House from Beijing  where Press had traveled to meet with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.After Carter’s term as president  Press returned briefly to MIT before returning to Washington to become president of the National Academy of Sciences  where he served for 12 years  advocating vigorously for international exchanges of research and scientists  as well as overseeing a 1986 report warning of potential danger of HIV/AIDS  and promoting science education.Among many awards and some 30 honorary degrees  Press received a gold medal from the Royal Astronomical Society  NASA’s Distinguished Public Service Medal  the Japan Prize  the Vannevar Bush Award  and a National Medal of Science for his “contributions to the understanding of the deepest interior of the Earth and the mitigation of natural disasters  and his service in academia  as a government official  and at the National Academy of Sciences.”In 2000  he was designated president emeritus of the National Academy of Sciences  the first time that honor was bestowed.Press’ wife  the former Billie Kallick  who was prominent in the field of early childhood education  died in 2009. Press leaves two children  William H. Press of Austin  Texas  and Paula E. Press of Chapel Hill; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Aron Bernstein  professor emeritus of physics  dies at 88,Aron Bernstein  professor emeritus of physics and longtime anti-nuclear proliferation activist  died on Jan. 14 after a short battle with cancer. He was 88.Aron Bernstein joined MIT in 1961  and taught a broad range of physics courses from first-year to graduate level for 40 years. A member ofThe Hadronic Physics Groupin the Laboratory for Nuclear Science  his research was in intermediate energy physics  including nuclear and particle physics  with an emphasis on studying the basic structure of matter. He was also active in the anti-nuclear weapons movement with theCouncil for a Livable World  theUnion of Concerned Scientists  and theNuclear Weapons Education Project.“Aron was one of those rare beings — a thoughtful scholar  a good and cheerful person  and someone who worked with a lightness of being to make the world a better place ” said Jim Walsh  a senior research associate in MIT’sSecurity Studies Program who worked with Aron in the classroom andon the board of the Council for a Livable World.“He was a gentle soul  but also a persistent  if humble  instigator. He had a deep commitment and boundless energy for university students and for efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons.”Born April 6  1931  he grew up in Brooklyn and Queens  the son of Abraham and Lillian (Dashevsky) Bernstein  and the older brother of Grace. His father owned an engraving business specializing in mercury-and-glass thermometers. A physics major at Queens College  he was inspired by his professor Banesh Hoffman  who had worked with Albert Einstein. Bernstein recalled Hoffman promising an instant A if the class could solve a difficult math problem. “Aron and one of his friends worked on it for days ” recalled Bernstein’s wife  Susan Goldhor. “They took it very seriously and they actually came up with a solution. I don’t know if he got an A  but from the professor’s viewpoint there was an elegant solution  and theirs was a cobbled-together solution. Aron was like that  he would work on something and would not give up.”However  Bernstein was stumped by foreign languages  which was a requirement  so he switched to Union College  where he received a bachelor’s in physics in 1953. He then pursued his doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania  where he recalled a memorable colloquium featuring MIT Professor Victor “Viki” Weisskopf. “His physical intuition made a vivid impression on me  and I still remember him rubbing his fingers together to show his pleasure at getting to the nub of things ” said Bernstein.After receiving his PhD in 1958  Bernstein became a postdoc at Princeton University. He recalled asking his advisor Donald Hamilton to let him attend a summer program on nuclear physics in Colorado that featured Weisskopf. “I decided to present a project I’d done with my fellow postdoc Max Brennan ” Bernstein recalled. “I remember pacing the streets the evening before  wondering what Viki would ask me. After a few hours pacing around  I realized that Viki would say  ‘Very nice  but please explain how it works.’ I would then smile and explain on my fingers. Amazingly  that’s exactly what happened.”Soon after  Bernstein was drawn to interview at MIT. “He sort of fell in love with MIT and Cambridge ” recalled his wife. “He had a dream that was linked to MIT  where he was on the subway and every single person had a white coat and was a scientist.”He started in 1961 as an assistant professor of physics  and used accelerators around the world to study the structure of atomic nuclei by looking at reactions started by beams of particle accelerators. His first accelerator at MIT was the Markle cyclotron  an atom-smasher built in 1938 for nuclear and medical research  and newly refurbished. Bernstein saw it as an underutilized workhorse  and used its 30 MeV alpha particle beam to perform low-energy nuclear physics experiments. “We could get a lot of experiments done with the cyclotron ” he said. “We were quite active using a solid-state detector  so we had decent resolution. We made a lot of physics hay  so to speak  with this beam.”When Bernstein and four others came up for tenure in the mid-’70s  he had Weisskopf in his corner. “All four (other) physics candidates for promotion that year were turned down  but I was the one Viki successfully fought for ” recalled Bernstein.Bernstein was an experimental nuclear scientist but also worked on the theoretical side of physics. He collaborated with multiple laboratories at home and abroad  including France as a Guggenheim fellow  Germany as a Humboldt fellow  and in an exchange program with the physics and political science departments at Oxford’s Baliol College.“He covered a lot of ground ” said his colleague  professor of physics Robert Redwine. “He was highly esteemed.” Redwine and Bernstein wrote papers together  and alternated on round-the-clock shifts for weeks during accelerator experiments  most often at the formerBates Linear Accelerator Centerin Middleton  Massachusetts. “We would work rather intensely together ” Redwine said.Bernstein organized an internationally recognized chiral dynamics workshop in 1994. After the first two workshops  he stepped back to serve on its advisory committee. “He spent a lot of time to make sure it was useful  not just a bunch of senior people talking  and it was so successful they are still held every three years ” said Susan. “His attitude was ‘Let the young people run it.’ Some people are always angling to be senior author or to get more credit. Aron didn’t care about that. He only cared about the physics and mentoring young people.”Bernstein’s family used to tease him for not winning a Nobel prize like many of his physics colleagues. But as the saying goes  to be rich in friends is to be poor in nothing. And Bernstein had a talent for making friends among colleagues  students  and others around the world. After his death  Susan received condolence emails from many of Bernstein’s former students and colleagues  and they all expressed how much he had touched their lives.“Aron was the colleague I talked the most with about physics and also learned from the most about science ” said one former colleague  Haiyan Gao. “Aron's passion for physics is contagious and tremendously inspiring. He has always been so nurturing to young scientists and extremely generous in sharing his physics insight  knowledge  and wisdom.”“He was a dedicated classroom teacher who knew what he was talking about ” said Redwine. “He really liked to connect to people. He was good at making what he was saying relevant to you.”Victor F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics Alan Guth was an MIT first-year in 1964 when he took Bernstein’s 8.01 class  and he also chose Bernstein for his junior lab 8.14 (Experimental Physics II). That project extended into a senior thesis  and then a master's thesis. “From the beginning of this project  Aron made me feel for the first time like I was a physicist  and not just a student ” said Guth. “He always made the people he was speaking to feel important. When I was still an undergraduate  but had started working with him  he always invited me to the meetings of his research group  treating me like any other member of the group.”Bernstein’s former grad student and Jefferson Lab worker Peter Bosted recalled Bernstein’s “twinkle in his eye” and his generosity with his time. Bernstein’s former grad student Itaru Nakagawa said that “research with Aron was a joy for me.” Bernstein’s postdoc Cesar Fernandez-Ramirez said  “Aron became a mentor to me and showed me how I should conduct myself as a scientist and a human being. The world is a better place  thanks to people like him.”Bernstein was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi  and a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He retired from the physics department in 2001 after 40 years.Nuclear arms control activistBernstein never retired from keeping an eye on the hands of the Doomsday Clock. “The disarmament project is his capstone project  because it married his political and research passions ” said his son  Dan Bernstein MCP ’86. “He was really a peace activist.”Among those he teamed up with were fellow peace advocates Weisskopf and Phil Morrison  both Manhattan Project veterans; future Nobel laureate and professor of physics Henry Kendall; microbiologist Salvador “Salva” Luria; Center for Theoretical Physics founder Herman Feshbach; and professor of linguistics Noam Chomsky.“I was always aware of the fact that if I had been 20 years older  I would have been in the Manhattan Project ” Bernstein said. “I was fortunate in my career to have worked closely with  and to have been inspired by  three such extraordinary people as Viki  Salva  and Phil. I regularly got phone calls from Salva commanding me to “get your head out of the cyclotron and come to my office and do something important. Viki … was a tremendous sounding board and a moral force that I greatly benefitted from.”In 1969  Bernstein helped form the Union of Concerned Scientists and participated in its “Scientists Strike for Peace ” which disrupted research and classes to protest U.S. and MIT involvement in the Vietnam War. The strike led MIT to the divestment of the Instrumentation Laboratory (now Draper Laboratory)  a U.S. Department of Defense contractor.“The organizers were distressed  on the one hand  with the low level of political engagement of the scientific community  and more specifically with the role of military research on university campuses ” Bernstein wrote in a50-year retrospectiveon the strike.Years later  Bernstein joined a similar campaign to reject research funds for work related to President Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” space-based missile defense system.He served on the National Advisory Board of the Council for a Livable World  an organization aimed at educating Congress on issues of arms control. “He was quick to offer advice  and just as quick to offer and provide help ” said Executive Director John Tierney.Bernstein chaired a Federation of American Scientists chapter at MIT and the MIT Faculty Disarmament Study Group  and was the advisor to a student group on arms control  MIT’sGlobal Zero.Bernstein and his contemporaries grew up prepared for a Russian nuclear attack  practicing classroom duck-and-cover exercises  and working in buildings set up with basement bomb shelters. But he soon became aware that his post-Cold War students didn’t quite understand this nuclear threat. He gathered a group of volunteers  including Redwine and Los Alamos weapons program veteran Mike Hynes  to launch theNuclear Weapons Education Project. The idea was to supplement curriculums to increase nuclear-weapon literacy  and to set up a website to share information.In his final years  Bernstein continued to visit universities  and cultivated a network of physicists around the country on behalf of this project. “We were still having meetings and discussions on this a few months ago ” said Redwine. “It became more difficult for him because of health reasons  but he was still involved.” Guth added that Bernstein possessed an “inexhaustible concern for helping to make the world a better place.”Family lifeBernstein married Marlene Reshall in 1956  and raised two children  Dan and Amy. The couple divorced in 1975.His family benefited from Bernstein’s ability to combine his work with travel and a love of the outdoors. In 1968  he took them on his sabbaticals to France and New Mexico. When China opened up to the West in the late ’70s  he not only wanted to make connections with Chinese physicists  he took Dan with him  with detours to Japan  India  Germany  and England. Wherever he traveled for work  he’d find a spot to go hiking. He enjoyed living in Cambridge  Massachusetts  so he could bike to work and take his family sailing on the MIT boats  and family time was spent snowshoeing  cross-country skiing  or sailing.Bernstein met second wife Susan Goldhor through mutual friends. “I thought he was kind of cute and had a really nice smile ” she recalled. Susan  a biologist with an interest in mycology  recalled Bernstein joking that “I did mushrooms  and he did mushroom clouds.” On their first date  they hiked the White Mountains. Then they planned a longer hike. “I didn’t have the right socks  and I got blisters. These were big hikes every day. I was really having a hard time  I was in pain  I was exhausted  and so I complained to Aron about this. Aron hated whiners  so he wrote me a letter afterward that it wasn’t going to work out  that he wasn’t going to deal with whiners. He was a very  very straightforward person — he didn’t play games.”She convinced him that she wasn’t actually a whiner  and he took her to a Mozart concert at Jordan Hall. Bernstein loved music  “nothing later than Schubert  and preferably a lot earlier— I couldn’t get him to go to a Mahler concert.” They married in 1990. Hiking was a shared passion  and they bought a vacation home in the White Mountains. “We hiked in summer  fall  and winter — I remember hiking in a blizzard. Until Aron was 86  we were still hiking and snowshoeing together. The hikes got shorter but the pleasure was still there.”And he was still biking into MIT until the last couple of years  to work on his anti-nuclear projects or meet with friends.Bernstein “was the kind of person to whom it is quite difficult to say no  even when you should ” said Walsh. “He cared about you  the person sitting across from him in his office  and cared about the fate of humanity  and both are the better for it.”“Aron was certainly one of the most wonderful people I've known ” said Guth. “His dedication to helping to build a better world was unbounded.”Bernstein is survived by his wife  Susan Goldhor; daughter Amy Bernstein; son Dan Bernstein and daughter-in-law Efrat Levy; and three granddaughters  Dara  Meirav  and Tali.The Department of Physics is planning a memorial celebration later this year in honor of Aron Bernstein.
Maurice Fox  professor emeritus of biology  dies at 95,Maurice Sanford Fox  professor emeritus of biology and former head of the Department of Biology  passed away on Jan. 26 at the age of 95.Fox was instrumental in creating and revising several courses within the biology major  and served as department head from 1985 to 1989. His research focused on bacterial genetics  and he pioneered investigations into bacterial transformation.“Maury was a force in the department for many years ” says current department head Alan Grossman  the Praecis Professor of Biology. “He was very involved in the graduate program  and served as a mentor and friend to many of us. He cared deeply about the department  the scientific enterprise  and bioethics.”Fox was born in the Bronx  New York  in 1924 to a family of poor Jewish immigrants; his father had fled Russia to avoid being conscripted into the tsar’s army. Growing up  Fox had little interest in science  and considered himself small for his age and “not very noticeable.” However  one teacher took an interest in him  and encouraged him to apply to Stuyvesant High School  which specialized in math and science. It took him an hour to make the commute each day  but he relished his biology and chemistry courses  where he got to study flies and flatworms and learn how to blow glass.Fox graduated from high school at age 16 and enrolled in Queens College with the intent of majoring in chemistry. After a year and a half  he left to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Force and attend their meteorology program  eventually becoming a full-time meteorologist and traveling all over the American South to forecast weather for the military. At the time  he aspired to become a doctor  but didn’t have enough money for medical school. Instead  at age 22  he returned to Queens College to continue taking chemistry courses.He went on to receive his PhD in chemistry from the University of Chicago  where he studied under Willard Libby and specialized in nuclear chemistry. Realizing he had no interest in nuclear weapons  Fox began scanning the bulletin boards at the University of Chicago for other opportunities post-graduation  and came across Leo Szilard’s lab. Szilard had discovered a chemical reaction  known as the “Szilard-Chalmers reaction ” which Fox had just used to complete his thesis in physical chemistry. Fox joined the lab and became fascinated with Szilard’s continuous-flow device  called a chemostat  used for growing hundreds of generations of bacteria under constant conditions. To Fox  the device was a new way to think about kinetics  which “treated living things like chemicals.”Fox considered Szilard to be his most influential mentor  inspiring him both scientifically and personally. Szilard encouraged Fox to take biology classes  and Fox became increasingly enthralled by bacterial genetics — a subject he later taught in classes of his own.Several years later  the two joined forces to establish theCouncil for a Livable World. Their plan was to create an organization that would raise money for senatorial candidates who would be “sensible” about nuclear weapons and avoid nuclear catastrophe. Fox felt this conviction to uphold the social and political responsibilities of being a researcher throughout his entire life. He fought to reduce the risks of radiation  biological warfare  and gene editing  and later went on to chair MIT’s Radiation Protection Committee and become a member of UNESCO’s International Bioethics Committee.At the time that Fox and Szilard were building the Council for a Livable World  Fox was completing his postdoc with biochemist Rollin Hotchkiss at Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research — the country’s first biomedical institute — which later became Rockefeller University. After his postdoc  he rose through the ranks to become an associate professor before being recruited to MIT in 1962.As a bacterial geneticist  Fox used bacterial transformation as an experimental model for genetic analysis to gain insights into mechanisms of genetic modification. He later extended his investigations to transduction and conjugation. Fox helped lay the foundation of our modern understanding of DNA mutation  recombination  and mismatch repair — efforts which directly and indirectly influenced key advancements like the search for RNA viruses and the discovery of the SOS response. He also had a keen interest in evaluating the effectiveness of medical procedures  including diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the National Academy of Sciences  and the National Academy of Medicine  among other prominent professional organizations.Fox remained active in the Department of Biology for 34 years  retiring in 1996. During that time  he taught several Course 7 subjects and mentored graduate and undergraduate students  as well as postdocs.Fox was among the founding generation of molecular biologists who migrated from the physical sciences  says David Botstein  one of Fox’s earliest trainees at MIT. He remembers Fox as both an intellectual mentor and a life coach. Fox befriended many and his house was always full of visitors  with whom he shared his love for science  culture  art  and politics. “Maury introduced me to the quantitative study of microorganisms and the importance of DNA mutation and recombination — which I had expected — but also to the rigorous and persistent skepticism that led me to constantly search for alternatives to the current thinking ” Botstein says. “In this way  Maury introduced me to an approach to science and learning that shaped my entire career.”Michael Lichten PhD ’82 also credits Fox with teaching him how to think about science. “Maury taught as much by example as by direction  and he transmitted a deep and profound commitment to teaching that guides many of his students to this day ” he says."Maury was a colleague  a mentor  and  most importantly  a friend ” recalls H. Robert Horvitz  Nobel laureate and one of Fox’s former undergraduate students. “Maury truly helped shaped my life  from my undergraduate days as a student in his genetics class to many more recent days  when he always offered both warmth and wisdom.”“This is a man who made an astonishing difference in an astonishing number of lives ” adds Evelyn Fox Keller  Fox’s sister and professor emerita of history and philosophy of science at MIT. “He made a difference to the world. His life was devoted to making the world a better place for people — and he did.”Fox is survived by his three sons  Jonathan  Gregory  and Michael  and his sisters Evelyn and Frances  who is a professor emerita of political science at the Graduate Center  City University of New York. Fox was predeceased by his wife of more than 50 years  Sally. The Department of Biology will hold a memorial celebration of Fox’s life in the spring.
Jeanne Guillemin  biological warfare expert and senior advisor at MIT  dies at 76,Jeanne Guillemin  a medical anthropologist and biological warfare expert  died on Nov. 15  2019  at her home in Cambridge  Massachusetts. She was 76.Guillemin received her bachelor’s degree in social psychology from Harvard University in 1968 and her doctorate in sociology and anthropology from Brandeis University in 1973. She was a professor of international relations and anthropology at Boston College  where she taught for 33 years.From 2006 until her death  she served as a senior advisor to the MIT Security Studies Program (SSP).“Jeanne was a great scholar  with a ferocious appetite for getting to the bottom of whatever history she chose to study. Beyond her scholarship  she enlivened the Security Studies Program with both her wit and her charm  while also serving as a role model for our community  especially women scholars. She will be missed ” says Taylor Fravel  Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science and director of SSP.Guillemin was instrumental in launching a women’s international speakers series at the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS)  which has been effective in reaching women graduate students  fellows  and faculty in the greater Boston  Massachusetts area.Shortly before her death  sheestablished an endowed fund at CISto provide financial support to female PhD candidates studying international affairs. She described her gift as a resource to graduate students to help energize their sense of inquiry and search for knowledge. The first disbursements of this fund will be made in the spring for the next academic year.“Jeanne was a model of interdisciplinary excellence to all — and especially women. Her endowment was such a gracious and thoughtful gesture on her part. We will always remember Jeanne and the contributions she made to our community and beyond ” says Richard Samuels  the Ford International Professor of Political Science and director of CIS.The New York Timesdescribed her as a “scientific sleuth” andThe Washington Postas a “pioneering researcher” in obituaries that lauded her groundbreaking work in biological warfare — a field where men had long outnumbered their female colleagues.Indeed  she was a sought-after analyst on the use of biological weapons and published four books on the topic.Her first book  “Anthrax: The Investigation of a Deadly Outbreak” (University of California Press  1999)  documents her epidemiological inquiry into the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak in the Soviet Union.With a MacArthur Foundation writing award  she next wrote “Biological Weapons: The History of State-sponsored Programs and Contemporary Bioterrorism” (Columbia University Press  2005)  a valued course text.Her 2011 book  “American Anthrax: Fear  Crime  and the Investigation of the Nation's Deadliest Bioterrorist Attack” (Macmillan/Henry Holt  2011)  was praised by reviewers as the definitive version of the 2001 letter attacks that changed national policy regarding bioterrorism. It was awarded a 2012 Mass Center for the Book/Library of Congress Award in nonfiction.Her most recent book  “Hidden Atrocities: Japanese Germ Warfare and American Obstruction of Justice at the Tokyo Trial” (Columbia University Press  2017) was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. It explains how Imperial Japan's use of biological weapons during World War II failed to be prosecuted at the Tokyo war crimes trial of 1946-48.In addition to consulting and lecturing  she was a member of the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on WMD (2009-13)  served on the board of Transaction Books  and was an associate of the Harvard-Sussex Program on chemical and biological weapons disarmament.Her family has requested that gifts in her memory be made to theJeanne E.

Professor Emeritus Ali Argon  pioneer in the mechanics of materials  dies at 89,Ali S. Argon SM '53  ScD '56  the Quentin Berg Emeritus Professor of Mechanical Engineering  passed away on Dec. 21  2019  at the age of 89. A world-leading expert in the mechanics of materials  Argon’s pioneering research furthered the field’s understanding of inelastic deformation and fracture of materials including metals and alloys  ceramics  glasses  polymers  and composites.Argon was born in 1930 in Istanbul  Turkey  to a Turkish father and a German mother. After completing high school in Turkey  Argon moved to the United States  where he obtained a bachelor of science degree from Purdue University in 1952. He then enrolled in graduate school at MIT  where he studied materials science under Professor Egon Orowan. Argon received his master’s degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1953 and his doctoral degree in 1956. His doctoral thesis examined the strength and anelasticity of glass.After receiving his doctorate  Argon spent two years working on Van de Graaf particle accelerators for both research and medical applications at the High Voltage Engineering Corporation in Burlington  Massachusetts. He then returned to Turkey in 1958 to serve in the Turkish Army Ordnance Corps.In 1960  after two years of military service  Argon returned to MIT  having accepted a faculty position in mechanical engineering. By 1968  he was named a full professor. In 2001  Argon was named the Quentin Berg Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.Throughout his career  Argon combined novel experiments with theoretical and computational modeling to deepen the understanding of inelastic deformation and fracture of engineering materials. His research shed light on the connections between microstructure and macroscopic deformation and failure properties of engineering solids.Having published 335 research works  Argon is one of the most-cited researchers in the field of mechanics of materials. Along with co-author Frank A. McClintock  he wrote the seminal text “Mechanical Behavior of Materials” (Addison-Wesley  1966). As one of the first books to provide an overview of the mechanical behavior of metals as well as ceramics  rubbers  and polymers  many consider the work as the beginning of the mechanics and materials field.In addition to his impactful research contributions  Argon was a dedicated educator throughout his career at MIT. He mentored over 30 doctoral students  many of whom have gone on to become leading experts in the field. In the mid-1990s  Argon helped reshape the graduate program in mechanical engineering at MIT by leading an ad hoc committee. Under his leadership  the committee put forth recommendations for graduate programs designed for students interested in pursuing careers in industry.Argon received numerous awards and honors in recognition for his research contributions. In 1989  he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for “major contributions to the understanding of deformation and fracture of engineering materials through the application of mechanics to microstructure." He was also made a fellow of the American Physical Society. Among his many awards are the ASME Nadai Medal  ETH’s Staudinder Durrer Medal  and the Heyn Medal of the German Materials Society. In 2005 he received an honorary doctoral degree from his alma mater  Purdue University.Argon is survived by his wife  Xenia (nee Lacher)  and his son  Kermit. He was predeceased by his daughter  Alice  in 2015.
Professor Emeritus Woodie Flowers  innovator in design and engineering education  dies at 75,Woodie Flowers SM ’68  MEng ’71  PhD ’73  the Pappalardo Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering  passed away on Oct. 11 at the age of 75. Flowers’ passion for design and his infectious kindness have impacted countless engineering students across the world.Flowers was instrumental in shaping MIT’s hands-on approach to engineering design education  first developing teaching methods and learning opportunities that culminated in a design competition for class 2.70  now called2.007 (Design and Manufacturing I). This annual MIT event  which has now been held for nearly five decades  has impacted generations of students and has been emulated at universities around the world. Flowers expanded this concept to high school and elementary school students  working to help found the world-wideFIRST Robotics Competition  which has introduced millions of children to science and engineering.Born in 1943  Flowers was reared in Jena  Louisiana. He became interested in mechanical engineering and design at a young age thanks in large part to his mother and his father  who was a welder with a penchant for tinkering and building. Growing up  Flowers also expressed a love of nature and traveling. When he wasn’t working on cars or building rockets as a teenager  he was camping with his family in Louisiana or collecting butterflies. This interest in nature led to an award-winning science fair project on the impact the environment has onLepidoptera. Flowers’ passion for both building and nature also helped him earn the rank of Eagle Scout.Flowers received his bachelor’s degree in engineering from Louisiana Tech University in 1966. After graduating  he spent a summer as an engineering trainee for the Humble Oil Company before enrolling in MIT for graduate school. He received his master’s of science in mechanical engineering in 1968 and an engineer’s degree in 1971. Two years later he earned his doctoral degree under the supervision of the late Professor Robert Mann. For his thesis  Flowers designed a “man-interactive simulator system” for the development of prosthetics for above-knee amputees. He would continue to design above-knee prosthetics throughout his career.As Flower’s academic career progressed  his wife Margaret acted as a partner in everything he did. Early in their marriage  when Flowers was just starting out at MIT  she worked to support their family financially. Later in life  she left her own career to partner with Flowers on his work in FIRST.After earning his PhD  Flowers joined MIT’s faculty as assistant professor of mechanical engineering. Within his first year he was teaching what was then known as 2.70  now called 2.007. Under Flowers’ leadership  the class evolved into a hands-on experience for undergraduate students  culminating in a final robot competition.“From the beginning 2.007/2.70 was about building a device to accomplish a task ” Flowers explained in a2015 video. Students were given an assortment of materials to design and build their devices. In the 1970s these materials included tongue depressors and rubber bands  but over the years the competition has gone on to include 3D-printed parts and computer chips.Despite the increased sophistication  according to Flowers the core of the course remained unchanged. “Some of the stuff that stayed the same is the wonderful way you compete like crazy but help each other out ” he said. Flowers would coin the phrase “gracious professionalism” to describe this idea of being kind and respecting and valuing others  even in the heat of competition.PBS highlighted Flowers’ innovative educational approach to class 2.007 in a 1981 documentary “Discover: The World of Science.” The network continued to cover the 2.007 robotics competition throughout the 1980s  and nearly a decade later  Flowers hosted the popular PBS series “Scientific American Frontiers ” from 1990-1993. One of the program’s objectives was to get people interested in science and engineering. He was awarded a regional Emmy Award for his work on the series.At the same time  Flowers helped develop a new program to inspire young people that built upon the competition he developed for 2.007. He collaborated with Dean Kamen  founder of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)  to develop a robotics competition for high school students. In 1992  the inaugural FIRST Robotics Competition was held  giving high school students from around the world an opportunity to design and build their own robots.Over the past three decades  FIRST robotics has grown into a global movement serving 660 000 students from over 100 countries each year. It provides scholarship opportunities totaling over $80 million available to FIRST high school students. Flowers’ mantra of “gracious professionalism” remains at FIRST’s core. In 1996  William P. Murphy  Jr. founded the annualWoodie Flowers Awardwithin FIRST to celebrate communication in engineering and design. The award “recognizes an individual who has done an outstanding job of motivation through communication while also challenging the students to be clear and succinct in recognizing the value of communication.”While working on FIRST  Flowers continued to have impact on mechanical engineering education  its future directions  and engineers’ professional role in society  in addition to envisioning how the use of digital resources could enhance residential learning.At MIT  he served as head for the systems and design division in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the early 1990s and was named Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering in 1994.  While Flowers retired in 2007  he remained an active member of the MIT community as professor emeritus up until his death.Flowers mentored countless engineering students during his 35 years on the MIT faculty. He served as undergraduate and master’s thesis advisor for Megan Smith ’86  SM ’88  former chief technology officer of the United States  as well as doctoral advisor to David Wallace SM ’91  PhD ’95  Ely Sachs ’76  SM ’76  PhD ’83  and Alexander Slocum ’82  SM ’83  PhD ’85  all of whom are professors of mechanical engineering at MIT.Flowers had a lasting impact on the generations of mechanical engineering students he taught. From encouraging students to embrace ambiguity to pulling out a massive dictionary in the middle of class to help students find a precise word to articulate their point  his role in shaping students’ lives went far beyond the tenets of design and engineering. Many of his students who have gone on to be educators themselves have implemented his educational ethos in their own classrooms and labs.Throughout his career  Flowers received numerous awards and accolades for his vast contributions to engineering education. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers honored him with both the Ruth and Joel Spira Outstanding Design Educator Award and the Edwin F. Church Medal. Flowers received the J.P. Den Hartog Distinguished Educator Award  was a MacVicar Fellow  and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. He also served as a distinguished partner and a member of the President's Council at Olin College of Engineering.Flowers is survived by his beloved wife Margaret Flowers of Weston  Massachusetts  his sister  Kay Wells of St. Augustine  Florida  his niece Catherine Calabria  also of St. Augustine  his nephew  David Morrison of Arlington  Virginia  as well as generations of grateful and adoring students.Memorial donations to FIRST and memories of Flowers may be delivered viathis websiteor mailed to FIRST c/o Director Dia Stolnitz  200 Bedford Street  Manchester  New Hampshire  03101.MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering will be organizing a digital memorial in Woodie’s honor where alumni  former colleagues  and students are welcome to share their remembrances. Remembrances may be submitted via theMechE website.This article will be updated with information about memorial services as it becomes available.
David H. Koch  prominent supporter of cancer research at MIT  dies at 79,David H. Koch ’62  SM ’63  one of the most important benefactors in MIT’s modern history  has died. He was 79 years old.Koch’s willingness to back significant initiatives at the Institute was exemplified by his foundational gift establishing the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research  a pioneering facility that brings research scientists and engineers together to advance the frontiers of cancer medicine. The Koch Institute has become a centerpiece of MIT’s pursuit of biomedical innovation and the useful application of knowledge to global health.Koch had wide-ranging interests concerning the life of the Institute  however  and in addition to cancer research  he supported many other causes and activities at MIT  including chemical engineering  childcare for employees  and athletics. At any given moment around MIT  beneficiaries of Koch’s gifts included faculty with endowed professorships  students with fellowships he supported — and toddlers in the childcare center he helped found.“David Koch had a brilliant instinct for opportunities where the lever of his philanthropy could make a transformative difference ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “As one example  his gift to launch the Koch Institute dramatically advanced a new strategy in which engineers and scientists push the frontiers of cancer research by working side by side. At the same time  he saw that the David H. Koch Childcare Center could play an indispensable role in helping young faculty  staff  postdocs  and graduate students manage the balance of family and career. We are grateful for his longstanding devotion to the Institute. Very few graduates have left such a broad and indelible mark on the life of MIT.”The Koch Institute  dedicated in 2011  was backed by a $100 million gift Koch made to MIT in October 2007  allowing for a new state-of-the-art facility at MIT and an innovative  interdisciplinary approach to the fight against cancer. The Koch Institute houses a wide array of world-leading scientists: Five current and former faculty have been awarded the Nobel Prize  and nine current and former faculty have been awarded the National Medals of Science or Technology and Innovation. All told  Koch has given MIT $134 million to support cancer research and facilities.“From my very first days as MIT’s president  David Koch became a friend  collaborator  supporter  and enthusiast ” says President Emerita Susan Hockfield  who led MIT from 2004 to 2012. “He already had a long history of generosity to MIT  but his commitment to accelerating progress against cancer gave particular force to MIT’s efforts to reimagine our own cancer research. David was one of this nation’s most generous donors to cancer research  and his engagement with many of the leading cancer research centers gave him an amazingly sophisticated understanding of the frontier of cancer biology and therapy.”The Koch Institute emphasizes five main areas of research: the development of nanotechnology-based cancer treatments; new devices for cancer detection and monitoring; research about the molecular and cellular processes of metastasis; the advancement of personalized medicine  by studying cancer pathways and resistance to drugs; and research about how the immune system can fight cancer.“This is a new approach to cancer research with the potential to uncover breakthroughs in therapies and diagnostics ” Kochsaid in 2007. “Conquering cancer will require multidisciplined initiatives and MIT is positioned to enable that collaboration. As a cancer survivor  I feel especially fortunate to be able to help advance this effort.”President Emerita Hockfield  whose tenure included the period when David H. Koch made his initial gift funding the Koch Institute  as well as its opening  lauded Koch’s visionary support of the project.“David provided resources  of course  but also wisdom and strategy to keep the project on time and on budget ” Hockfield says. “He took personal interest in the people and projects at what became the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.”Koch’s embrace of an interdisciplinary center for fighting cancer advanced and enhanced MIT’s capabilities in this arena  notes Tyler Jacks  the David H. Koch Professor of Biology at MIT  and director of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.“As an MIT-trained engineer  David immediately saw the value in bringing together the great strengths in engineering on our campus with our cancer science efforts in order to solve the most challenging problems in cancer ” Jacks says. “As a cancer survivor  he has been deeply committed to supporting innovative approaches to improve outcomes for patients. David chose to invest in MIT because he believed that we were uniquely positioned to change the course of cancer  and his generosity has enabled us to do that.”Jacks added that MIT benefitted from Koch’s high level of interest in the the research projects he backed.“From the earliest days of planning the Koch Institute  David dug into the details ” Jacks says. “He was always inquisitive and really enjoyed asking probing questions  whether about the HVAC system in the building or the intricacies of nanotechnology-based cancer therapy. David was a huge supporter of what we do and rightly proud of what we have created in the Koch Institute. And we are extremely grateful for his support.”In addition to the named chair Jacks holds  Koch endowed other professorships that bear his name  held by MIT faculty in the fields of biology  biological engineering  chemical engineering  and materials science and engineering.David H. Koch was born in Wichita  Kansas  on May 3  1940. He graduated from Deerfield Academy  a prep school in Massachusetts  and received his bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from MIT in chemical engineering  the Institute’s Course 10. He joined Koch Industries  the firm founded by his father  in 1970  and became president of a division of the company  Koch Engineering  in 1979. He served as executive vice president of Koch Industries until publicly announcing his retirement  due to his health  in June 2018.Koch was also a Life Member Emeritus of the MIT Corporation. He first became a Member of the Corporation in 1988  and was elected a Life Member in 1998.Beyond cancer research  Koch was also a significant supporter of MIT’s programs in chemical engineering. In the 1980s  Koch made a significant gift to sustain the School of Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT  whose roots go back to 1916. Now known as the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice  this is a unique program for graduate students combining coursework with internships  to enhance both academic and professional development.“David Koch was a model philanthropist who funded initiatives across a swath of cultural  scientific  and medical institutions ” says Robert Millard  chair of the MIT Corporation. “His generosity has benefited humanity broadly — from the arts to cancer research to science. MIT is deeply thankful for his many contributions to our community.”In a different vein  Koch served as lead donor for the David H. Koch Childcare Center at MIT  which opened in 2013 and almost doubled the childcare capacity on campus. Situated on Vassar Street on the west side of the MIT campus  the center provides high-quality support for MIT faculty  postdocs  graduate students  and staff who are raising young families  often while pursuing intensive research careers.Koch decided to give $20 million for the facility after serving on the Biology Visiting Committee at MIT — one of many such groups that advise the Institute — and recognizing the need for more extensive childcare facilities in order to help attract and retain talented personnel on campus. Along with Koch  Charles W. Johnson ’55 and Jennifer C. Johnson also helped fund the facility.A less well-known but vital aspect of Koch’s relationship with MIT was his enduring support for the Institute’s basketball team. Koch was a standout basketball player as an undergraduate  and captained the MIT team during the 1961-62 season  his senior year; he played alongside his brother Bill on MIT’s varsity team. David Koch’s attachment to the program continued throughout his life.Indeed  Koch not only followed the team  and attended team banquets  but endowed the position of coach for the men’s basketball team  a role that has been filled since the 1995-96 season by Larry Anderson. During that time  MIT has had a superb run of success  which includes making the NCAA Division III Final Four in 2012.“My heart goes out the entire Koch family " says Anderson. “I know that David had lots of love and interests – we were lucky enough that MIT Basketball was one of them. He was proud to wear the MIT Cardinal red and silver gray as captain of the team. He was the record-holder for 47 years for the most points scored in a single game with 41  and his support meant so much to the MIT Basketball family.”“David’s generous philanthropy allowed us to do many impossible things at MIT  but I have valued equally his curiosity  interest  engagement  and enthusiasm ” Hockfield says. “Coming from an MIT family  David Koch was truly a son of MIT who made the Institute a better place  for its students and faculty  and for the lives they change through their work.”
John Ball  longtime Haystack Observatory scientist  dies at 83,Former MIT Haystack Observatory scientist John Allen Ball died Aug. 6 at age 83  of complications resulting from Alzheimer’s disease.Ball was born in 1935 at his family’s home in Ravenna  Nebraska. He graduated from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1957 with a BS in electrical engineering and served for two years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in Libya.After returning from Libya  Ball earned a PhD in astrophysics from Harvard University  and launched his career as a radio astronomer at Harvard  first at the Harvard College Observatory in Harvard  Massachusetts  and later at Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics and its radio astronomy station in Fort Davis  Texas. Ball also taught astronomy at Worcester State College.In 1984  Ball joined MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford  Massachusetts  where he worked as a research scientist until his retirement in 2006. At Haystack  he worked with the 37-meter-diameter radio telescope  part of a global network of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiments  and was instrumental in making the Haystack 37-meter antenna available for radio astronomy. Ball was a member of the MIT group that was awarded the prestigious Rumford Medal  along with groups from Canada and the NRAO-Cornell  by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for pioneering work in VLBI in April 1971.Colleagues from MIT Haystack Observatory share very fond memories of Ball as a co-worker and friend. Michael Titus remembers him as an enthusiastic “Renaissance man who was always trying to find clever ways to help people solve problems or make their lives safer  better  or easier.” Director Colin Lonsdale says  “He was bright  articulate  and curious about all things  and one of his crusades was to make the case  whenever and wherever he could  for curiosity-driven science.”Throughout his career  Ball published extensively in astrophysics. Other publications include the book "Algorithms for RPM Calculators"(1978)  as well as “The Zoo Hypothesis” (1973) and “The Search for Extraterrestrial Life: Recent Developments” (1985).Ball had a wide range of interests  including civil rights activism  photography  motorcycling (from Ducatis to BMWs  as seen in the slideshow above)  sailing  poetry reading and writing  classical music appreciation  sushi making  and veganism. He organized a film series on nutrition  which was shown on the local cable station. He also served on the Town of Harvard Cable Committee and helped with videotaping town meetings.He died peacefully at his home in Harvard  Massachusetts  surrounded by family. He is survived by his wife of 64 years  Audrey Roth Ball; daughters Fifine  Desirée  and Laurie; son Kevin (Teresa Gudger); nephew Michael Ball (Beth); grandchildren Justin Walsh  Daniel Walsh  Jessica Anderson (Duke)  Audrey Lewis  Lindsey Champion (Corey)  and Samantha Gudger; and great-grandchildren Brookelan Heck and Tucker Ray Champion.A memorial service will be held on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers  donations in his name may be sent tothe Alzheimer’s Association.
Marcus Karel  food science pioneer and professor emeritus of chemical engineering  dies at 91,Marcus “Marc” G. Karel PhD ’60  professor emeritus of chemical engineering  died on July 25 at age 91. A member of the MIT community since 1951  Karel inspired a generation of food scientists and engineers through his work in food technology and controlled release of active ingredients in food and pharmaceuticals.Karel was born in Lvov  Poland (now Lviv  Ukraine) to Cila and David Karel  who ran a small chain of women’s clothing stores in the town. After war arrived in Poland in 1939  the family business was lost  relatives were scattered and disappeared  and the Karels spent the last 22 months of the war in hiding. After the war  Karel and his family eventually emigrated to the United States  where they settled in Newton  Massachusetts  just outside of Boston. Karel completed his bachelor’s degree at Boston University in 1955 and earned his doctorate in 1960 at MIT.Before Karel started his graduate studies at MIT  he was invited by the head of the former Department of Food Technology to manage the Packaging Laboratory. Here he began his interest in the external and internal factors that influence food stability. In 1961  he was appointed professor of food engineering at MIT in the former Department of Nutrition and Food Science (Course 20)  eventually becoming deputy head of the department. When Course 20 (then called Applied Biological Sciences) was disbanded in 1988  Karel was invited to join the Department of Chemical Engineering. After retiring from MIT in 1989  he became the State of New Jersey Professor at Rutgers University from 1989 to 1996  and from 1996 to 2007 he consulted for various government and industrial organizations.During his academic career at MIT and Rutgers  Karel supervised over 120 graduate students and postdocs. Most of them are now leaders in food engineering. Several of his trainees from industry are now vice presidents of research and development at several companies. Along with his engineering accomplishments  Karel was known for his ability to build and manage successful teams  nurture talent  and create a family environment among researchers.Karel was a pioneer in several areas  including oxidative reactions in food  drying of biological materials  and the preservation and packaging and stabilization of low-moisture foods. His fundamental work on oxidation of lipids and stabilization led to important improvements in food packaging. Also  when NASA needed expertise to design food and food systems for long-term space travel  it was Karel’s work that formed the platform for many of the enabling developments of the U.S. space program. MIT Professor Emeritus Charles Cooney relates  “When the solution to an important problem required improved analytical techniques  he pioneered the development of the techniques. When the solution required deeper insight into the physical chemistry of foods  he formulated the theoretical framework for the solution. When the solution required identification of new materials and new processes  he was on the front line with innovative technologies. No one has had the impact on the field of food science and engineering as Marc.”Karel earned many recognitions for his work  including a Life Achievement Award from the International Association for Engineering and Food  election to the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering  the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT)’s Nicholas Appert Medal (the highest honor in food technology)  election to the Food Engineering Hall of Fame  several honorary doctorates  and the one of which he was most proud: the first William V. Cruess Award for Excellence in Teaching from the IFT. The first edition of his co-authored book  "The Physical Principles of Food Preservation " is considered by many to be the "bible" of the field of food stability.Karel is survived by his wife of almost 61 years  Carolyn Frances (Weeks) Karel; son Steven Karel and daughters Karen Karel and Debra Karel Nardone; grandchildren Amanda Nardone  Kristen Nardone  Emma Griffith  and Bennet Karel; sister Rena Carmel  niece Julia Carmel  and great-nephew David Carmel; Leslie Griffith (mother of Emma and Ben); nephew James Weeks Jr.  and niece Sharon Weeks Mancini.Funeral arrangements were private. A celebration of Karel’s life will take place later this year. Memorial contributions may be made to the American Red Cross.
Jack Kerrebrock  professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics  dies at 91,Jack L. Kerrebrock  professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT  died at home on July 19. He was 91.Born in Los Angeles in 1928  Kerrebrock received his BS in 1950 from Oregon State University  his MS in 1951 from Yale University  and his PhD in 1956 from Caltech. With a passion for aerospace  he held positions with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  Caltech  and Oak Ridge National Laboratory before joining the faculty of MIT as an assistant professor in 1960.Promoted to associate professor in 1962 and to full professor in 1965  Kerrebrock founded and directed the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ Space Propulsion Laboratory from 1962 until 1976  when it merged with the department’s Gas Turbine Laboratory  of which he had become director in 1968. In 1978  he accepted the role of head of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro).Kerrebrock enjoyed an international reputation as an expert in the development of propulsion systems for aircraft and spacecraft. Over the years  he served as chair or member of multiple advisory committees — both government and professional — and as NASA associate administrator of aeronautics and space technology.As associate director of engineering  Kerrebrock was the faculty leader of the Daedalus Project in AeroAstro. Daedalus was a human-powered aircraft that  on 23 April 1988  flew a distance of 72.4 miles (115.11 kilometers) in three hours  54 minutes  from Heraklion on the island of Crete to the island of Santorini. Daedalus still holds the world record for human-powered flight. This flight was the culmination of a decade of work by MIT students and alumni and made a major contribution to the understanding of the science and engineering of human-powered flight.Elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978  Kerrebrock was the recipient of numerous accolades  including election to the status of honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  as well as the Explorers Club and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. A member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  Sigma Xi  Tau Beta Pi  and Phi Kappa Phi  he received NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal in 1983. He was also a contributor to the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change  which along with Al Gore won the Nobel Prize in 2007.Although a luminary in his field  Kerrebrock — an enthusiastic outdoorsman — was perhaps never happier than when climbing a mountain  hiking a wilderness trail  or leading a group of young people through ice and snow to teach them independence and survival skills. He ran his first Boston Marathon in his early 50s on a whim  with no training  following that with several more marathons  including the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington.Kerrebrock and his wife Crickett traveled widely  to destinations including South Africa  Scotland  Tuscany  Paris  and a very special trip to Canaveral for one of the last Space Shuttle launches  where he was able to introduce his wife to his friend Neil Armstrong  who was one of her heroes.Kerrebrock was married to Rosemary “Crickett” Redmond (Keough) Kerrebrock for the last 12 years of his life. He was previously married for 50 years to the late Bernice “Vickie” (Veverka) Kerrebrock  who died in 2003. In addition to his wife  Kerrebrock leaves behind two children  Nancy Kerrebrock (Clint Cummins) of Palo Alto  California  and Peter Kerrebrock (Anne) of Hingham  Masachusetts; and five grandchildren  Lewis Kerrebrock  Gale Kerrebrock  Renata Cummins  Skyler Cummins  and Lance Cummins. He was preceded in death by his son Christopher Kerrebrock  brother Glenn  and sister Ann. He also is remembered fondly by the Redmond children  Paul J. Redmond Jr. and his partner Joe Palombo  Kelly Redmond and her husband Philip Davis  Maura Redmond  Meaghan Winokur and James Winokur and their children  Laine and Alicia.A public memorial service is being planned at MIT and will be announced soon. In lieu of flowers  contributions in his memory may be made to the Jack and Vickie Kerrebrock Fellowship Fund  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  600 Memorial Drive  Cambridge MA 02139.
Professor Emeritus Samuel Bowring  pioneering geologist and expert in geochronology  dies at 65,Professor Emeritus Samuel A. Bowring  a longtime MIT professor of geology  died on July 17 at age 65.Known for his exceptional skill as a field geologist and for innovatons in uranium-lead isotopic geochronology  Bowring worked to achieve unprecedented analytical precision and accuracy in calibrating the geologic record and reconstructing the co-evolution of life and the solid Earth.No dates  no ratesA favorite aphorism  “No dates  no rates ” appeared in many of Bowring’s lectures and talks — meaning  to fully understand the past events preserved in the rock record you have to understand their timing. One of his earliest major contributions  which transformed what geologist know about the early evolution of the Earth  was his work in the 1980s on the Acasta gneiss complex  a rock body in northwestern Canada  pushing back the date of the oldest-known rocks to 4.03 billion years. The granitic samples he collected from an outcrop on an island in the remote Acasta River basin turned out to be rare remnants of the Earth’s earliest crust.“What is more important about the Acasta gneiss complex than its 4.03 billion year age alone is its character  which Sam recognized and documented ” said Paul Hoffman  Harvard University Sturgis Hooper Professor Emeritus of Geology and career-long Bowring collaborator and friend. Hoffman explains that the Acasta rocks  paired with Bowring’s advocacy  fundamentally changed geologists’ understanding of continental formation. Prior to Bowring’s work the prevailing view was that the continents had steadily grown over geologic time. But  with these ancient gneiss samples  Bowring was able to characterize a complex history which predated the moment of their crystallization  which points instead to a process of ongoing crustal “recycling” — where rock near the Earth’s surface  through the mechanisms of plate tectonics  is subsumed and transformed by the mantle’s convective currents. According to Hoffman  “Sam’s fascination with the creation and preservation of continental crust never left him  whether he was at Great Bear Lake  the Grand Canyon  or the High Cascades in Washington State.”Beyond studying the physical processes which shape the lithosphere  Bowring also sought to understand those which shape the biosphere. His work on sedimentary layers of the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary age determined the timing and rate of the pivotal biological event known as the Cambrian Explosion  beginning nearly 540 million years ago. He was able to establish that the Early Cambrian period which saw the most dramatic burst of evolutionary activity and animal diversity ever known — including the first emergence of chordates  brachiopods  and arthropods — spanned not 10 to 50 million years as was previously-believed  but instead lasted a mere 5 to 6 million years.Longtime friend and colleague Tim Grove  the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT  wrote of the achievement in a citation for the American Geophysical Union when Bowring was awarded the Walter H. Bucher Medal in 2016: “Sam showed that during this brief time interval more phyla than have ever since existed on Earth came into existence. This represents a truly profound and astonishing new discovery about how life evolved on Earth.”Bowring also established the timing and duration of what has come to be known as “The Great Dying”: the largest of Earth’s five major mass extinctions  which marked the end of the Permian period and saw the elimination of over 96% of marine species and about 70% of species on land. Rocks collected by Bowring and collaborators from sites across China spanning the Permian-Triassic boundary revealed that the ecological collapse happened at breakneck speed — occurring in less than 30 000 years at a rate many times faster than previous estimates — and with little-to-no warning in geological terms.A world-expert in uranium-lead isotopic dating  by 2002 Bowring began to see what he later termed “the double-edged sword of high-precision geochronology.” As the field experienced rapid advancements in precision  resolution  and quantitative stratigraphic analyses  many new techniques were developing in parallel. He recognized that without calibration and intercalibration of radioisotopic dating methods and quantitative chronostratigraphy  their accuracy and capacity as individual tools for understanding deep time were diminished. In response  he and colleague Doug Erwin conceived the EARTHTIME Initiative  a community-based effort to foster collaboration across the disciplines and eliminate inter-laboratory and inter-technique biases. Bowring’s common refrain to members to “check our egos at the door” reflected his unwavering goal to push the accuracy of geochronology to new levels  and helped the initiative build consensus and develop best practices and protocols. EARTHTIME continues to lead international workshops  expanding beyond topics of calibration and standardization to engage with the broader geoscience community  seeking to understand the rock record in ever more refined and nuanced ways.“If the art of geochronology is the rendering of dates in their proper geologic context  Sam is our Michelangelo ” former MIT Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) department head and close friend and colleague Tom Jordan said of Bowring. “He has always insisted that knowing what you are dating and why are as important as fixing the date itself; that the precision of absolute dating is most powerful when samples can be placed precisely in section.”Bowring’s interest in the applications of tracer isotopes to examine Earth systems also extended to their utility in tracking environmental contaminants. His lab has developed methods for not only tracing naturally-occurring sources and establishing natural regional baselines  but also for documenting variations which correlate with anthropogenic inputs associated with urbanization and industrialization.A dedicated teacher and mentorBowring joined the faculty of EAPS at MIT in 1991 where  in addition to fostering the careers of over two dozen graduate students and postdocs  he demonstrated a career-long commitment to advancing undergraduate education. For more than 20 years Bowring served as a first-year and undergraduate advisor  eventually being named a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow in 2006 by the Institute program which recognizes faculty for  “exemplary and sustained contributions to the teaching and education of undergraduates at MIT ” and later earning the MIT Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2007. He was also deeply involved in helping to shape curricula  serving on the MIT Committee on Curriculum from 2007 to 2010. He also served as chair of the EAPS Program in Geology and Geochemistry from 1999 until 2002  at which time he became chair of the EAPS Undergraduate Committee  serving until 2015. As a field geologist  he took his keen interest in engaging students to off-campus venues  leading annual trips into the field which were fixtures in the department’s calendar — from western Massachusetts to Yellowstone to the Las Vegas desert.“Sam was an exceptionally effective and dedicated undergraduate educator  having gone well ‘above and beyond’ for EAPS and our students ” recalls Grove. “He took on more undergraduate teaching than any other member of our department in the last 25 years and was deeply committed to the importance of training undergraduates in the field — providing students with hands-on experience and using real-world geology to inspire and teach fundamentals.”Bowring also was instrumental in guiding Terrascope  a first-year learning community created jointly by EAPS and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2002. Bowring became associate director of the program in 2006  going on to serve as director from 2008 to 2015. The nationally-recognized program  which has been the subject of several academic papers and has grown to become one of MIT’s largest first-year communities  asks students with diverse research interests to tackle complex  global problems involving sustainability  climate  and the Earth system in a series of team-oriented  student-driven classes. In 2013  Bowring and his coauthors described the innovative curriculum by saying  “Our emphasis is on using a multidisciplinary approach to show that understanding the geosciences … is important to the students' world view  whether they know it or not. We believe it is our responsibility to teach as many students as we can about the Earth system  and in our experience  Terrascope students have a greatly expanded consciousness about the Earth and humans’ effect on it.”Born in Portsmouth  New Hampshire  on Sept. 27  1953  Bowring was raised in Durham  New Hampshire  where he also later attended the University of New Hampshire. After graduating in 1976 with a bachelor’s degree in geology  he went on to study at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology  where he earned a master’s in 1980.At the University of Kansas  Bowring had the opportunity early on to work with PhD advisor Randall Van Schmus on a project in the Northwest Territories of Canada (NWT) — where he was first introduced to collaborator Hoffman — which laid the foundation for both his PhD and continuing studies in the NWT’s Proterozozoic Wopmay orogen after joining the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis (WU) in 1984. It was as an assistant professor at WU that Bowring made his seminal analysis of the Acasta gneiss from the region  along with Ian Williams from the Australian National University.In addition to being named a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy for the Advancement of Science  Bowring  the Robert R. Schrock Emeritus Professor of Geology  was a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and was recognized by the organization with both the Norman L. Bowen Award and Walter H. Bucher Medal. He was also a fellow of both the Geochemical Society and the Geological Society of America.He is survived by his wife of 30 years  Kristine M. (Fox) Bowring  two stepdaughters  Kelley Kintner and Sara Henrick  as well as his siblings  James Bowring  Joseph Bowring  and Margaret Ann Bowring-Price. At the family’s request  there will be no formal services.
Celebrating a curious mind: Steven Keating 1988-2019,Alumnus Steven John Keating SM '12  PhD '16 passed away from brain cancer on July 19 at the age of 31.Keating received his master’s degree and PhD in mechanical engineering and was a member of the MIT Media Lab’s Mediated Matter team. He inspired countless people with his courageous  research-driven approach to battling cancer and was a champion for patient access to health data.Curiosity was a driving force in Keating’s life. Growing up in Calgary  Canada  he spent a large portion of his childhood tinkering with and building devices. This predilection for making led to not only his love of engineering  but also his affinity for film and photography. As an undergraduate at Queen’s University in Kingston  Canada  Keating pursued his twin passions — earning a dual degree in mechanical and materials engineering alongside a degree in film and media.In 2010  Keating fulfilled his lifelong dream of attending MIT and enrolled as a graduate student studying mechanical engineering. He joined theMedia Lab’s Mediated Mattergroup under his co-advisor Neri Oxman  the Sony Corporation Career Development Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences.At the Media Lab  Keating conducted research on additive manufacturing and synthetic biology. He pushed the limits of 3-D printing anddeveloped a technologythat could 3-D print the foundation of a building. This technology was recently acquired by NASA for potential applications in their pursuit of landing on the moon by 2024.“Steve utilized humor while solving equations and inspired a sense of empathy when discussing ethical issues associated with robotics and synthetic biology ” Oxman reflects. “The projects he left behind are very much alive and will continue to have meaningful impact on the physical and societal landscapes we inhabit.”In theDepartment of Mechanical Engineering  Keating served as a teaching assistant for the senior capstone class 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes)  alongside his co-advisor  David Wallace  professor of mechanical engineering. He also helped teach the popular introductory course 2.00b (Toy Product Design) with Wallace.“Steve had an infectious kindness and curiosity that elevated those around him  exploring simply for the joy and thrill of learning ” says Wallace. “His teaching contributions in our freshman toy product design and senior product engineering design classes made an enduring impact.”Four years into his graduate studies at MIT  Keating’s world was turned upside down when a baseball-sized tumor was found in his brain. The innate curiosity that had brought him to MIT ultimately led to his diagnosis. In a2014 speech at the Koch Institute  Keating recalled: “Curiosity is why we are here [at MIT] doing research  and ironically that’s how I found my tumor.”As an undergraduate in 2007  Keating had participated in a brain study purely out of curiosity. His MRI scans revealed a small dime-sized abnormality located near the smell center of his brain. This knowledge prompted Keating to seek medical attention when  in the summer of 2014  he began smelling vinegar and getting headaches. A new MRI scan showed a low-grade glioma in the frontal left lobe of his brain that would require immediate surgery.After receiving this news  Yoel Fink  professor of materials science and engineering  entered Keating’s life. Fink had previously developed a fiber optic scalpel that enabled minimally invasive surgery on brain tumors. As a result  he was connected to the top neurosurgeons in the world. Fink put Keating in touch with E. Antonio Chiocca  neurosurgeon-in-chief and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery atBrigham and Women’s Hospitalin Boston. Chiocca performed the surgery to remove his tumor.In an email to his friends and family in advance of the surgery  Keating wrote: “The world is a lovely  splendid  and fascinating place. But most of all  to me  it is beautifully curious.”Keating proved to be anything but an average patient. “Steve confronted his disease like a true “MITer”: He studied it  researched it  applied his creativity and interest in the sciences and engineering to see how best to face this enemy ” explains Chiocca.Ever the researcher  Keating craved every possible data point he could get about his diagnosis and treatment. Upon learning that accessing medical data required the approval of a medical doctor  he enrolled in an MD program while finishing up his PhD – earning him the nickname ‘MacGyver’ among his colleagues in the Media Lab.Keating poured over footage of his 10-hour surgery  analyzed his own MRI scans  and had his microbiome sequenced. He even 3-D printed a model of his tumor  which he gifted his friends and family as a very unique Christmas ornament. This model led to a partnership with colleagues at the Media Lab and Harvard University to developa new method to 3-D printmore detailed models from medical images.Keating collected 200 gigabytes of his own medical data. Given that knowledge of his own MRI scans and medical data led to his timely diagnosis  he became a staunch advocate for open-sourcing patient data. He wanted to empower patients to gain access to their own health information.“Steve became a voice for patients’ desires to have access and own the data for their disease ” adds Chiocca. “He did this with humility  courage  joy and affability.”Keating’s crusade on behalf of patients everywhere led to aNew York Timesarticleabout his efforts in March 2015. His story was covered widely by the media and inspired millions of people. He gave aTEDx Talkabout his experiences  joined the Federal Precision Medicine Task Force  and received an invitation to the White House by President Barack Obama.“For him it was all about awareness — he was willing to give up his privacy and share his data with the world to advance the likelihood of an eventual cure for this disease ” says Fink  who along with Oxman remained close to Keating and his family throughout the years.In remission thanks to the efforts of Chiocca and his team of doctors  Keating continued his work with Oxman in the Mediated Matter group. “Even and especially while battling cancer  Steve remained noble in his ways ” adds Oxman. “Whether taking the initiative on group-based work or gathering the team to discuss a new publication  it was humbling to watch him help others as he battled his challenging condition.”Keating graduated with his PhD in 2016. He moved to Silicon Valley  where he worked as a design engineer at Apple.Last summer after a routine check-up  he was told he had glioblastoma  a malignant and incurable form of brain cancer. Even after receiving this devastating diagnosis  Keating never lost sight of the impact he could have on others. He tirelessly advocated for patient access to medical data in an effort to save the lives of others  all while undergoing multiple experimental trials and courageously fighting for his own life.“A defining element of his character was to be gracious and giving while he was fighting the battle of his life ” says Fink.Though Keating ultimately succumbed to the disease  others will take up his mantle in the fight for a cure and greater access to patient data. Two days before he passed away  the first ever Glioblastoma Awareness Day was observed to raise awareness and honor those who have lost their lives to this aggressive form of brain cancer.“Steve never let the knowledge that glioblastoma remains incurable stop him from living his life to the fullest without anger and disappointment ” adds Chiocca. “As cancer scientists  we will continue to research this disease so that Steve’s fight remains our fight.“His passion and spirit will live on with his former colleagues at MIT. “Steven’s presence was luminous and so is his legacy ” says Oxman. “My team and I are honored to continue where our very own ‘MacGyver’ left off.”Keating is survived by his parents  John and Lynn  and his sister  Laura. In lieu of a traditional memorial service  Keating’s family has created a "cyber celebration" as a forum for people to honor and celebrate his inspiring  curiosity-driven life.

Professor Patrick Winston  former director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  dies at 76,Patrick Winston  a beloved professor and computer scientist at MIT  died on July 19 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 76.A professor at MIT for almost 50 years  Winston was director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory from 1972 to 1997 before it merged with the Laboratory for Computer Science to become MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).A devoted teacher and cherished colleague  Winston led CSAIL’sGenesis Group  which focused on developing AI systems that have human-like intelligence  including the ability to tell  perceive  and comprehend stories. He believed that such work could help illuminate aspects of human intelligence that scientists don’t yet understand.“My principal interest is in figuring out what’s going on inside our heads  and I’m convinced that one of the defining features of human intelligence is that we can understand stories '” said Winston  the Ford Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science  in a 2011 interview for CSAIL. “Believing as I do that stories are important  it was natural for me to try to build systems that understand stories  and that shed light on what the story-understanding process is all about.”He was renowned for his accessible and informative lectures  and gave a hugely popular talk every year during the Independent Activities Period called “How to Speak.”“As a speaker he always had his audience in the palm of his hand ” says MIT Professor Peter Szolovits. “He put a tremendous amount of work into his lectures  and yet managed to make them feel loose and spontaneous. He wasn’t flashy  but he was compelling and direct. ”Winston’s dedication to teaching earned him many accolades over the years  including the Baker Award  the Eta Kappa Nu Teaching Award  and the Graduate Student Council Teaching Award.“Patrick’s humanity and his commitment to the highest principles made him the soul of EECS ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the MIT community. “I called on him often for advice and feedback  and he always responded with kindness  candor  wisdom and integrity.  I will be forever grateful for his counsel  his objectivity  and his tremendous inspiration and dedication to our students.”Teaching computers to thinkBorn Feb. 5  1943 in Peoria  Illinois  Winston was always exceptionally curious about science  technology and how to use such tools to explore what it means to be human. He was an MIT-lifer starting in 1961  earning his bachelor’s  master’s and doctoral degrees from the Institute before joining the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1970.His thesis work with Marvin Minsky centered on the difficulty of learning  setting off a trajectory of work where he put a playful  yet laser-sharp focus on fine-tuning AI systems to better understand stories.His Genesis project aimed to faithfully model computers after human intelligence in order to fully grasp the inner workings of our own motivations  rationality  and perception. Using MIT research scientist Boris Katz’s START natural language processing system and a vision system developed by former MIT PhD student Sajit Rao  Genesis can digest short  simple chunks of text  then spit out reports about how it interpreted connections between events.While the system has processed many works  Winston chose “Macbeth” as a primary text because the tragedy offers an opportunity to take big human themes  such as greed and revenge  and map out their components.“[Shakespeare] was pretty good at his portrayal of ‘the human condition ’ as my friends in the humanities would say ” WinstontoldThe Boston Globe. “So there’s all kinds of stuff in there about what’s typical when we humans wander through the world.”His deep fascination with humanity  human intelligence  and how we communicate information spilled over into what he often described as his favorite academic activity: teaching.“He was a superb educator who introduced the field to generations of students ” says MIT Professor and longtime colleague Randall Davis. “His lectures had an uncanny ability to move in minutes from the details of an algorithm to the larger issues it illustrated  to yet larger lessons about how to be a scientist and a human being.”A past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)  Winston also wrote and edited numerous books  including a seminal textbook on AI that’s still used in classrooms around the world. Outside of the lab he also co-founded Ascent Technology  which produces scheduling and workforce management applications for major airports.He is survived by his wife Karen Prendergast and his daughter Sarah.
Professor Emeritus Fernando Corbató  MIT computing pioneer  dies at 93,Fernando “Corby” Corbató  an MIT professor emeritus whose work in the 1960s on time-sharing systems broke important ground in democratizing the use of computers  died on Friday  July 12  at his home in Newburyport  Massachusetts. He was 93.Decades before the existence of concepts like cybersecurity and the cloud  Corbató led the development of one of the world’s first operating systems. His “Compatible Time-Sharing System” (CTSS) allowed multiple people to use a computer at the same time  greatly increasing the speed at which programmers could work. It’s also widely credited as thefirst computer system to use passwords.After CTSS Corbató led a time-sharing effort called Multics  which directly inspired operating systems like Linux and laid the foundation for many aspects of modern computing. Multics doubled as a fertile training ground for an emerging generation of programmers that included C programming language creator Dennis Ritchie  Unix developer Ken Thompson  and spreadsheet inventors Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.Before time-sharing  using a computer was tedious and required detailed knowledge. Users would create programs on cards and submit them in batches to an operator  who would enter them to be run one at a time over a series of hours. Minor errors would require repeating this sequence  often more than once.But with CTSS  which was first demonstrated in 1961  answers came back in mere seconds  forever changing the model of program development. Decades before the PC revolution  Corbató and his colleagues also opened up communication between users with early versions of email  instant messaging  and word processing.“Corby was one of the most important researchers for making computing available to many people for many purposes ” says long-time colleague Tom Van Vleck. “He saw that these concepts don’t just make things more efficient; they fundamentally change the way people use information.”Besides making computing more efficient  CTSS also inadvertently helped establish the very concept of digital privacy itself. With different users wanting to keep their own files private  CTSS introduced the idea of having people create individual accounts with personal passwords. Corbató’s vision of making high-performance computers available to more people also foreshadowed trends in cloud computing  in which tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft rent out shared servers to companies around the world.“Other people had proposed the idea of time-sharing before ” says Jerry Saltzer  who worked on CTSS with Corbató after starting out as his teaching assistant. “But what he brought to the table was the vision and the persistence to get it done.”CTSS was also the spark that convinced MIT to launch “Project MAC ” the precursor to the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). LCS later merged with the Artificial Intelligence Lab to become MIT’s largest research lab  theComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory(CSAIL)  which is now home to more than 600 researchers.“It’s no overstatement to say that Corby’s work on time-sharing fundamentally transformed computers as we know them today ” says CSAIL Director Daniela Rus. “From PCs to smartphones  the digital revolution can directly trace its roots back to the work that he led at MIT nearly 60 years ago.”In 1990 Corbató was honored for his work with the Association of Computing Machinery’sTuring Award  often described as “the Nobel Prize for computing.”From sonar to CTSSCorbató was born on July 1  1926 in Oakland  California. At 17 he enlisted as a technician in the U.S. Navy  where he first got the engineering bug working on a range of radar and sonar systems. After World War II he earned his bachelor's degree at Caltech before heading to MIT to complete a PhD in physics.As a PhD student  Corbató met Professor Philip Morse  who recruited him to work with his team on Project Whirlwind  the first computer capable of real-time computation. After graduating  Corbató joined MIT's Computation Center as a research assistant  soon moving up to become deputy director of the entire center.It was there that he started thinking about ways to make computing more efficient. For all its innovation  Whirlwind was still a rather clunky machine. Researchers often had trouble getting much work done on it  since they had to take turns using it for half-hour chunks of time. (Corbató said that it had a habit of crashing every 20 minutes or so.)Since computer input and output devices were much slower than the computer itself  in the late 1950s a scheme called multiprogramming was developed to allow a second program to run whenever the first program was waiting for some device to finish. Time-sharing built on this idea  allowing other programs to run while the first program was waiting for a human user to type a request  thus allowing the user to interact directly with the first program.Saltzer says that Corbató pioneered a programming approach that would be described today as agile design.“It’s a buzzword now  but back then it was just this iterative approach to coding that Corby encouraged and that seemed to work especially well ” he says.In 1962 Corbató published a paper about CTSS that quickly became the talk of the slowly-growing computer science community. The following year MIT invited several hundred programmers to campus to try out the system  spurring a flurry of further research on time-sharing.Foreshadowing future technological innovation  Corbató was amazed — and amused — by how quickly people got habituated to CTSS’ efficiency.“Once a user gets accustomed to [immediate] computer response  delays of even a fraction of a minute are exasperatingly long ” he presciently wrote in his 1962 paper. “First indications are that programmers would readily use such a system if it were generally available.”Multics  meanwhile  expanded on CTSS’ more ad hoc design with a hierarchical file system  better interfaces to email and instant messaging  and more precise privacy controls. Peter Neumann  who worked at Bell Labs when they were collaborating with MIT on Multics  says that its design prevented the possibility of many vulnerabilities that impact modern systems  like “buffer overflow” (which happens when a program tries to write data outside the computer’s short-term memory).“Multics was so far ahead of the rest of the industry ” says Neumann. “It was intensely software-engineered  years before software engineering was even viewed as a discipline.”In spearheading these time-sharing efforts  Corbató served as a soft-spoken but driven commander in chief — a logical thinker who led by example and had a distinctly systems-oriented view of the world.“One thing I liked about working for Corby was that I knew he could do my job if he wanted to ” says Van Vleck. “His understanding of all the gory details of our work inspired intense devotion to Multics  all while still being a true gentleman to everyone on the team.”Another legacy of the professor’s is “Corbató’s Law ” which states that the number of lines of code someone can write in a day is the same regardless of the language used. This maxim is often cited by programmers when arguing in favor of using higher-level languages.Corbató was an active member of the MIT community  serving as associate department head for computer science and engineering from 1974 to 1978 and 1983 to 1993. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Corbató is survived by his wife  Emily Corbató  from Brooklyn  New York; his stepsons  David and Jason Gish; his brother  Charles; and his daughters  Carolyn and Nancy  from his marriage to his late wife Isabel; and five grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to MIT’sFernando Corbató Fellowship FundviaBonny Kellermannin the Memorial Gifts Office.CSAIL will host an event to honor and celebrate Corbató in the coming months.
Philip Freelon  professor of the practice and champion of diversity in architecture  dies at 66,Philip G. Freelon MArch ’77  professor of the practice in the MIT Department of Architecture  lead architect for the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture  and a dedicated force for inclusivity within the field of architecture  died on July 9 in Durham  North Carolina  of the neuro-degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  with which he had been diagnosed in 2016. He was 66.For nine years beginning in 2007  Freelon taught 4.222 (Professional Practice)  a required subject in the master’s in architecture program that uses current examples to illustrate the legal  ethical  and management concepts underlying the practice of architecture.“Phil was a remarkable architect  a motivating teacher  a spirited public intellectual and above all  an exceptional human being whose modesty and respect of others and their ideas put the best face on the architect and on the profession ” says Hashim Sarkis  dean of MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P).A native of Philadelphia  Freelon attended Hampton University in Virginia before transferring to North Carolina State University  from which he graduated in 1975 with a bachelor of environmental design degree in architecture. He earned his master’s degree in architecture from MIT and at age 25 was the youngest person to pass the Architecture Registration Exam in North Carolina.The Freelon Group  which he founded in 1990  became one of the largest African American-owned architectural firms in the country.“Phil Freelon was a creative and productive alumnus of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning ” says Adèle Naudé Santos  SA+P dean when Freelon joined the faculty. “His buildings are beautifully crafted and spatially inventive  and we were proud to have him on our faculty. We are greatly saddened by his passing.”Freelon headed multifaceted design teams for museum projects and cultural institutions such as the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco  the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture in Baltimore  the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta  the Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts and Culture in Charlotte  Emancipation Park in Houston  and the Anacostia and Tenleytown branches of the District of Columbia Public Library System.The practice joined with three other design firms as Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup to create the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. As lead architect and architect of record for the project  on which David Adjaye was lead designer  Freelon directed the programming and planning effort that set the stage for the museum’s design.In 2014  The Freelon Group joined global design firm Perkins and Will. Recent and current projects led by Freelon include North Carolina Freedom Park in Raleigh  the Durham County Human Services Complex  the Durham Transportation Center  and the Motown Museum Expansion in Detroit. He was appointed to the board of directors and the executive committee of Perkins and Will while serving dual roles as managing director and design director of the firm’s North Carolina practice.In addition to his role at MIT  he was an adjunct faculty member at North Carolina State University’s College of Design and lectured at Harvard University (where he was a Loeb Fellow)  the University of Maryland  Syracuse University  Auburn University  the University of Utah  the University of California at Berkeley  Kent State University  and the New Jersey Institute of Technology  among others. A Peer Professional for the GSA’s Design Excellence Program  he also served on numerous design award juries including the National AIA Institute Honor Awards jury and the National Endowment for the Arts Design Stewardship Panel.“Phil was one of the hardest working people I ever knew ” said Lawrence Sass  associate professor in the Department of Architecture at MIT and director of the computation group. “I could not believe that someone so humble could have done so much. He was a dedicated professor in addition to being a trusted design professional  and a leader who lived in the spirit of a design giant. He taught from real-world experience. He was emotionally and professionally accessible. I will forever miss and remember his larger-than-life presence walking down the Infinite Corridor.”Freelon was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects  and the recipient of the AIA North Carolina’s Gold Medal  its highest individual honor. A LEED Accredited Professional  he was the 2009 recipient of the AIA Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture  and in 2011 was appointed by President Obama to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. The Freelon Group received 26 AIA design awards (regional  state  and local) and received AIA North Carolina’s Outstanding Firm Award (2001). Freelon’s furniture design received first prize in the PPG Furniture Design Competition  and he did design contract work with Herman Miller.His work has appeared in national professional publications includingArchitecture Progressive Architecture Architectural Record  andContractmagazine (Designer of the Year  2008)  and his and the firm’s work has been featured inMetropolisandMetropolitan Homemagazines and theThe New York Times.Freelon is survived by his wife of 40 years  Nnenna Freelon; his children Deen  Maya  and Pierce; three siblings; and six grandchildren. A celebration of his life will be held on Sept. 28 at the Durham County Human Services Complex in Durham. In lieu of flowers  donations can be made to NorthStar Church of the Arts  a nonprofit art and culture center founded by Nnenna and Phil Freelon.
Renowned architect I.M. Pei ’40 dies at 102,Celebrated architect I.M. Pei ’40 died on May 16 in New York City. He was 102.Over the course of a long international career  he designed notable buildings that included museums  cultural and research centers  civic buildings  and office towers. A dedicated modernist  he received the architecture world’s highest honors for his large body of work.Among his best-known projects are the glass pyramid entrance pavilion he designed for the Louvre museum in Paris  and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.In 1964  Jacqueline Kennedy chose Pei to design the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester  Massachusetts. Other Boston-area projects include the west wing of the Museum of Fine Arts.“Pei was a giant whose vast and varied output consistently rose to the civic responsibility of architecture  elevating cultural  institutional  and residential buildings alike to monuments of modern life ” says Hashim Sarkis  dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning.Pei designed four buildings for the MIT campus:Cecil and Ida Green Building for Earth Sciences (Building 54)  1962Camille Edouard Dreyfus Chemistry Building (Building 18)  1967Ralph Landau Building for Chemical Engineering (Building 66)  1976Wiesner Building (Building E15  original home of the MIT Media Lab)  1985“Pei's contribution to the physical environment of MIT has been significant  with several key buildings that established the form of the contemporary campus ” says Andrew Scott  professor and acting head of the Department of Architecture. “Building 66  which poses a triangular form that finely resolves the forces of the urban geometry  and Building 18  which elegantly frames the landscape of the inner quads  are still personal favorites and outstanding laboratory typologies to this day.”
Norman Phillips  former meteorology department head  dies at 95,Norman A. Phillips  head of the former Department of Meteorology during the 1970s  died on March 15 at the age of 95. His work in atmospheric science showing monthly and seasonal tropospheric patterns led to the creation of first general circulation model  which became the bedrock of weather and climate study today.Phillips’ introduction to the study of weather  which later blossomed into a passion  started when he was relatively young. Born to Alton Elmer Anton Phillips and Linnea (Larson) Phillips in 1923  Norman Phillips began his life in Chicago  Illinois. He entered the University of Chicago in 1940 to pursue chemistry. However  when World War II began  he was inspired by the work of University of Chicago’s Carl-Gustaf Rossby — now known as the "father of meteorology" and who helped to establish the Department of Meteorology at MIT — to train weather officers and take up a field he had never before encountered. He enlisted in the program  established by Rossby  with the U.S. Army Air Corps. Here  Phillips received computation meteorology training in Mississippi  at the University of Michigan  and in Illinois.Deployed to the Azores  he obtained atmospheric data and created daily forecasts for the Allied troops in spite of difficult weather conditions and communications difficulties. Working alongside experienced meteorologists  Phillips developed incredible insight and appreciation for the work. After the war  he was discharged as a first lieutenant and returned to Chicago to resume his studies  now with a focus on meteorology. Phillips earned bachelor’s  master’s  and doctoral degrees in 1947  1948  and 1951  respectively. At this point  the field was just getting off the ground.Phillips’ first major contribution to meteorology and the creation of reliable forecasting came during his PhD thesis work. Around the time the first computers were coming online  in 1950  the first numerical forecast was generated. It was developed to better understand how weather systems develop and intensify. It treated the atmosphere as a single layer  however  and subsequently meteorologists like Rossby considered a “two-level model” which better captured the dynamics of the atmosphere. Phillips combined this newer model with the work on baroclinic instability by Jule Charney  another giant in the field who later worked alongside and headed the department at MIT after Phillips. This allowed for the numerical growth of atmospheric waves that resembled those in the real world.Shortly before finishing his degree  Phillips joined the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  New Jersey  with Charney and several other leading meteorologists with whom Phillips would work with over his career. Expanding on these models  he applied his work to the same cyclonic weather system Phillips used for his thesis and made the first computer simulation reproducing it. “It was my understanding that it was the success with this storm that convinced the Weather Bureau  the Air Force  and the Navy to set up the original version of the NMC [National Meteorological Center] in 1954. This was the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit…” said Phillips in a seminar at MIT in 1988.After a brief stint in Stockholm to assist Rossby set up a weather model there  Phillips spent time in Oslo understanding the troposphere and different cells of atmospheric circulation capable to transporting heat. In Princeton  Phillips applied this to his general circulation model and was able to construct a forecast  which would breakdown after about a month. He also showed that fronts formed as a result of cyclogenesis  not the other way around as previously thought. This significant achievement became the first climate general circulation model.Around this time  MIT was building a powerhouse of meteorological and oceanographic experts; in the summer of 1956  then department head Henry Houghton recruited Jule Charney and Norman Phillips. While here  he held the titles of research associate  associate professor  and professor. He led the Department of Meteorology — a precursor to today’s Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) — for four years  beginning in 1970. Phillips left an indelible mark on MIT and the broader scientific community. He served on numerous national and international committees. As co-editor of theJournal of Atmospheric Science he took it upon himself to ensure publications of the highest quality.In July of 1974  Phillips left for the National Weather Service at the National Meteorological Center to pursue numerical weather prediction and data assimilation. He stayed there for four years before retiring in 1988; however  possessing an agile mind  he continued to publish well into his golden years.Phillips’ research had dramatically changed the way we think about our atmosphere; for these contributions to the field of meteorology  he has been recognized with numerous honors. In 2003  Phillips along with Joseph Smagorinsky received the Benjamin Franklin Medal from the National Weather Service  National Meteorological Center “for their major contributions to the prediction of weather and climate using numerical methods.”Their seminal and pioneering studies led to the first computer models of weather and climate  as well as to an understanding of the general circulation of the atmosphere  including the transports of heat and moisture that determine the Earth's climate. In addition  Smagorinsky played a leading role in establishing the current global observational network for the atmosphere  and Phillips' leadership fostered the development of effective methods for the use of observations in data assimilation systems.The American Meteorological Society also selected him for the highly prestigious distinction of an honorary member. From the same institution  he received the Meisinger Award  the Editor’s Award  the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Award (it’s highest honor)  the Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advance of Applied Meteorology  and was appointed a distinguished lecturer. Among his other honors  Phillips was also presented with the Napier Shaw Prize  elected to the National Academy of Sciences  and presented the 6th World Meteorological Organization’s lecture.Phillips was predeceased by his beloved wife Martha (Nissen) Phillips  whom he married in 1945; his daughter Ruth Walsh; and sister Alice (Phillips) Westphal. Phillips is survived by daughters Janet Grigsby and Ellen Chasse. He is also survived by grandsons Stephen Walsh  Matthew Grigsby  Christopher Grigsby  Derek Chasse and Keith Chasse  plus great grandchildren Ryan and Riley Walsh and Morgan and Travis Chasse.A memorial service will be held on June 29 at 11 a.m. at the Rivet Funeral Home  425 Daniel Webster Highway in Merrimack  New Hampshire.
James Livingston  senior lecturer emeritus in materials science and engineering  dies at 88,James D. Livingston  MIT senior lecturer emeritus  and his wife Sherry H. Penney  died last week at their home in Sarasota  Florida  where they spent their winters. Married for 34 years  he was 88 and she was 81; the cause was accidental carbon monoxide poisoning.Livingston's undergraduate education was in engineering physics at Cornell University  and his doctorate was in applied physics from Harvard University. He joined MIT in 1989  coming from Schenectady  New York  where he had been a physicist at GE Corporate Research and Development. The move to Boston was driven by his wife’s career; she was the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Boston and served for a time as the acting president of the UMass system. His work focused on magnetic materials  including metallic superconductors and rare-earth permanent magnets.At MIT  Livingston remained active in research  collaborating with several colleagues  mentoring graduate and undergraduate students  and adding valuable expertise to MIT’s teaching and research enterprise. He taught in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (Course 3  DMSE) undergraduate core and served as a first-year advisor  teaching a seminar on magnets. His accomplishments were recognized with awards including membership in the National Academy of Engineering and election to fellow of both ASM International and the American Physical Society  as well as MIT's Best First-Year Advisor Award. He authored many journal articles and books  on a variety of topics: "Electronic Properties of Engineering Materials" was based on his lectures for the DMSE undergrad curriculum; "Driving Force" and "Rising Force" are popular science books on magnetism; and  in a departure from science  he wrote "A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights" (co-authored with his wife) and "Arsenic and Clam Chowder: Murder in Gilded Age New York " both histories that grew out of family research.Although Livingston held a part-time position at MIT  he was fully committed to the students and their needs  and to the Institute. He taught many different classes  was a thesis advisor for graduate students  participated in professional education programs  and served as an ambassador for materials science and STEM education. His textbook  "Electronic Properties of Engineering Materials " was praised by students who used it — one even mentioned it on the subject evaluation  saying "the textbook ROCKS."Conversation with Livingston was entertaining  stimulating  and educational  studded with humor and anecdotes that helped make his point. Professor Emeritus Sam Allen says  "Both his writing and lecturing style were engaging because of Jim's conversational style and use of easily grasped examples to teach complex concepts." In one case  he told a class that the easiest thing to do was to find a needle in a haystack; "Needles are magnetic  hay isn't. All you need is a magnet " remembers Chris Schuh  head of DMSE.A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. May 25 in First Baptist Church in Hingham  Massachusetts. The service will be led by Rev. Kenneth Read-Brown  minister of First Parish  Hingham  known as Old Ship Church  a Unitarian Universalist congregation to which the couple belonged for many years  and which was unavailable due to repair work. A memorial service in Sarasota will be announced.
Franklin Fisher  professor emeritus of economics  dies at 84,Franklin M. Fisher  the Jane Berkowitz Carlton and Dennis William Carlton Professor of Microeconomics  emeritus  died on April 29 at the age of 84.Fisher was born in New York City and received both his undergraduate degree and his PhD from Harvard University. He joined the MIT faculty in 1960  after a one-year post-PhD stint as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. Fisher spent the rest of his career at MIT. In 2000  he was appointed the inaugural holder of the Jane Berkowitz Carlton and Dennis William Carlton Professorship of Microeconomics. He became a professor emeritus in 2004.Fisher was a versatile economist who made important contributions to economic theory  econometric methods  and the empirical analysis of firm and industry behavior. He was best known for his research on aggregation theory  estimation of simultaneous equation models  and the measurement and consequences of industry concentration. His contributions were widely celebrated. In 1973  he received the John Bates Clark Medal from the American Economic Association  an award then presented every other year to the American economist under the age of 40 who is judged to have made the most significant contributions to economic thought and knowledge. He served as president of the Econometric Society  was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and held an honorary degree from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Fisher was actively involved in antitrust policy. He served as the lead economic expert for IBM in the 1970s  when the U.S. Department of Justice sued the firm for anticompetitive behavior. After the case was settled in the early 1980s  he and co-authors John McGowan and Joen Greenwood published "Folded  Spindled and Mutilated " a comprehensive analysis of the economic issues in the case. Several years later  Fisher served as the lead expert for the Department of Justice in another high-profile antitrust case U.S. v. Microsoft.Late in his career  Fisher’s interests shifted to the economics of water distribution in the Middle East  leading a team to model water resources and identify opportunities for gains from cross-border water trading.Fisher was a very popular teacher and an active dissertation adviser. He served as the primary adviser for 47 doctoral students  and as the secondary adviser (committee member) for dozens more. Five of his advisees are current MIT faculty members  including Nancy L. Rose ’85  the current department head for Economics.“Frank was a wonderful mentor whose lectures combined technical rigor with a rich interest in applied questions " Rose says. "He was in high demand as a dissertation supervisor  where his advice ranged from econometric specifications to the craft of writing.”Fisher was active in a broad range of outside pursuits. He was a silver life master of duplicate bridge and an avid sailor. His work with numerous nonprofit organizations included presidencies of American Friends of Peace Now  the New Israel Fund  and the American Jewish Congress New England Region.He is survived by his wife  Ellen Paradise Fisher of Cambridge  Massachusetts; three children: Abraham and Abigail of Belmont  Massachusetts  and Naomi of Ann Arbor  Michigan  and their spouses; and eight grandchildren.
Professor Emeritus David Gordon Wilson  expert in human-powered transport and gas turbines  dies at 91,David Gordon Wilson  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering  passed away on May 2 at the age of 91. Wilson served on MIT’s faculty since 1966 and remained an active member of the mechanical engineering community up until his death.Wilson was born in 1928 and grew up in Warwickshire  England. Inspired by his love for bicycles  Wilson studied engineering at the University of Birmingham  where he received his bachelor’s degree in 1948. He continued his education at the University of Nottingham  where he earned his PhD in 1953.Upon completing his PhD  Wilson was given a postdoctoral Commonwealth Fund Fellowship to conduct research abroad at MIT and Harvard University. At the conclusion of his fellowship  Wilson worked at Boeing as a gas turbine engineer.After briefly returning to the U.K.  Wilson embarked on a two-year stint in Africa  where he taught at the University Ibadan in Zaria  Nigeria. He also worked for Voluntary Service Overseas in Cameroon. A case of malaria forced Wilson to move home to England.In 1960  Wilson was invited by the Northern Research and Engineering Corp. to serve as technical director and vice president. He was charged with leading efforts to form a London branch of the company that specialized in heat transfer and turbo-powered machinery.At the invitation of Richard Soderberg  then the head of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering  Wilson joined MIT’s faculty in 1966. He taught thermodynamics and mechanical design. As a professor  Wilson served as advisor to a number of students conducting research in turbomachinery  fluid mechanics  and various design topics.While much of his primary research focused on turbine gas engines and jet engine design  Wilson parlayed a number of his passions into professional pursuits. His interest in transportation led to an appointment on a commission of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  where he gave recommendations on how to increase use and efficiency in public transportation. He also served on the Center for Transportation Studies.Transportation was a key theme in Wilson’s career — not only in his research on jet engines  but also in a thread that would weave throughout his life: his love of bicycles. Wilson was particularly enamored with recumbent bicycles. In 1967  he helped organize an international design competition in human-powered land transport in an effort to get more people interested in bicycle design.In 1974  Wilson released the first edition of "Bicycling Science." It became MIT Press' best-selling book and is regarded as the premiere authority on bicycle design. Throughout the 1970s  he continued to design recumbent bicycles. He eventually designed the Avatar 2000  a bike that broke the world record in speed at the International Human Powered Vehicle Association in 1982.Around the same time  Wilson studied fossil fuel emissions and human impact on the environment. He was a staunch advocate for a “carbon fee” to encourage companies to curb fossil fuel emissions and promote the adoption of renewable energy. This pursuit got him more engaged in government  and as a result he joined the Massachusetts chapter of the grassroots organization Common Cause. He also was co-founder of the Massachusetts Action on Smoking and Health  which advocated for nonsmokers' rights.After 28 years on the faculty at MIT  Wilson retired in 1994. In 2001  he co-founded Wilson TurboPower  a company focused on the development of microturbines.In retirement  Wilson remained an active member of the MIT community — often attending departmental meetings and serving as a faculty judge at the annual de Florez Awards. He is survived by his wife  Ellen Wilson  his two daughters  Erica Mandau and Susan Wilson  and his granddaughter.A memorial service will be held on May 17 at 10 a.m. at The Parish of the Epiphany  70 Church Street  Winchester  Massachusetts.
Alexander Dingee  co-founder of MIT Venture Mentoring Service  dies at 88,Alexander L. M. Dingee Jr. ’52  co-founder of the MIT Venture Mentoring Service and a successful entrepreneur who started seven companies  died March 22  at his home in Rockport  Massachusetts  of complications from Parkinson’s Disease. He was 88.The Venture Mentoring Service  with more than 175 volunteer mentors from the business world  offers entrepreneurship coaching  without charge  to MIT students  faculty  staff  and alumni. Since its founding in late 2000 as one of MIT’s first hands-on entrepreneurship programs  these mentors have worked with more than 2 800 ventures involving 3 600 individuals. These ventures collectively have raised more than $3.1 billion in funding  and more than 300 ventures have launched as viable businesses.In 2013 Alec Dingee was awarded MIT's Lobdell Distinguished Service Award  which cited his "creative vision  exemplary dedication  and continuous involvement" as VMS co-founder.Dingee  along with the late David H. Staelin ’60  SM ’61  ScD ’65  an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science  launched VMS to carry out a shared belief that young entrepreneurs would benefit greatly from advice given by others who understand the obstacles in building a business.In an article in “MIT Spectrum” in 2001  Dingee cited how he started out in forming businesses  learning “the hard way” how to overcome the risks and roadblocks. “When I was young  I didn’t have anyone to advise me and I was in over my head. … I saw a real need for this kind of help.”Dingee and Staelin arranged for the program’s initial funding and  introduced to each other by former MIT Provost Robert Brown  worked to place VMS’ operations under the Provost’s office as a way to ensure services would be available to all schools within the Institute.At the outset  Dingee’s office was sometimes his car  and he and the initial handful of other mentors frequently met with their mentees in coffee shops. Dingee spent much of his time recruiting mentees  visiting Institute laboratories to tell students  faculty  and postdocs about the help VMS could give to commercialize their accomplishments.Within a year  VMS had grown to have a permanent office and a staff. In 2002  Sherwin Greenblatt ’62 SM ’64  the just-retired president of Bose Corp. joined as volunteer director  which freed Dingee  now as the program’s chairman  to spend time perfecting the program and exploring new directions. This led to creation of a VMS Outreach program extension  which since has provided training in VMS’s methods to representatives from 92 universities  colleges  and economic development organizations in the United States  Canada  and abroad.Dingee’s passion for perfection is seen as critical to VMS’s success. “He always insisted on doing things right ” Greenblatt says. “Over and above just mentoring  he zealously defended mentees against injustices or wrongs.” This included a strongly enforced code of ethics to block mentors from taking advantage of mentees.Roberta McCarthy  the program’s operations manager until 2017  looks back on how carefully the VMS concept was structured from the outset “It’s amazing how he was able to put it all together ” she says. “The original premise is how it exists today.” Charles “Chip” Ziering ’72  SM ’75  a founder of Progress Software Corp. and the first mentor to join the founders  adds  “The resulting organization's thriving activities are a tribute to his determination and drive.”Dingee’s career as a serial entrepreneur spanned five decades. His first business was a medical-device company he started during off-hours while in the Army. The peak came with Nexabit Networks  which developed the first terabyte-level internet router and was sold in 1999 to Lucent Technologies. He also led seminars and directed research on new venture development at MIT's Sloan School of Management and co-authored a book "New Venture Creation: A Guide to Entrepreneurship."He is survived by his wife  Susan Jennifer Gray of Rockport; his daughters  Adrienne Tybjerg and her husband Niels Tybjerg of Arlington  Massachusetts  and Janette Dingee and her husband William Brickey of Chicago; his stepson  James Wagner and his wife Dee Dee Chen of Cambridge  Massachusetts; and his first wife  Grace Dingee of Arlington.A Service to Celebrate Alec's Life will be held at the First Congregational Church of Rockport at 11 a.m. on Tuesday  April 9. In lieu of flowers donationsin Alec's memory may be made to the MIT Venture Mentoring Service.
Professor Emeritus T. Francis Ogilvie  former ocean engineering department head  dies at 89,Thomas (T.) Francis Ogilvie  professor emeritus of ocean engineering  passed away on March 30  at the age of 89. Ogilvie dedicated most of his career to improving how ocean engineering and naval architecture programs educated students. He served as department head for MIT’s Department of Ocean Engineering — then known as Course 13 — from 1982 to 1994.Born in Atlantic City in 1929  Ogilvie was surrounded by ocean and boats throughout his childhood. Despite his fascination with boats  he developed an aversion to the water that surrounded him due to a dislike of getting wet. At just 16  Ogilvie enrolled in Cornell University where he studied physics. While at Cornell  he was also appointed to the position of campanologist — or bell-ringer. As bell-ringer  he would climb Cornell’s bell tower and move huge levers to sound the bells over campus  serving as an alarm clock for his fellow students.After graduating with his bachelor’s degree in physics from Cornell  Ogilvie realized that he could study boats without getting wet. In 1951  he took a job as a physicist at the U.S. Navy’s David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) in Maryland. While at DTMB  Ogilvie conducted research on the dynamic response of ship structures to explosive loading. He later moved on to study the wave dynamics of ships  submarines  and hydrofoils. During this time  the U.S. Navy acknowledged Ogilvie’s important contributions with a Meritorious Public Service Award in 1955.Ogilvie received his master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Maryland in 1957. Three years later  he received his PhD in engineering science from the University of California at Berkeley. After receiving his doctorate  Ogilvie moved to London for eighteen months where he served as a Liaison Scientist for the Office of Naval Research. Upon returning to the U.S.  he worked at DTMB for three more years.In 1967  Ogilvie transitioned into a career in academia. He acted as associate professor of naval architecture and marine engineering at The University of Michigan  where he also taught fluid mechanics. He was eventually named chairman of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the University of Michigan.As chairman  Ogilvie made substantial changes to the department. He was responsible for a total restructuring of the undergraduate curriculum and helped develop their graduate program. Thanks in large part to his ability to garner donations from both industry and alumni  Ogilvie was responsible for the modernization of the department’s experimental facilities and the construction of a new building to house the department.In 1981  he resigned from his role at the University of Michigan  and in 1982 he arrived at MIT as professor and department head of ocean engineering. He served as department head for 12 years.As with his time in Michigan  Ogilvie made a number of substantial changes to MIT’s Department of Ocean Engineering. He revised the undergraduate program — now known as Course 2-OE — and helped launch several new laboratories. One of the most impactful changes he made as department head was integrating MIT’s Naval Construction and Engineering Program into MIT’s School of Engineering.Ogilvie was beloved by his colleagues in ocean engineering at MIT. Upon stepping down as department head in 1994  he was honored with the launch of the T. Francis Ogilvie Young Investigator Lectureship in Ocean Engineering. The annual lectureship series was created in recognition of Ogilvie’s contributions to the field of ocean engineering and “with special gratitude for his commitment in mentoring and supporting young faculty and researchers.”Throughout his career  Ogilvie was recognized with numerous awards and honors. He was invited to serve as visiting professor of naval architecture in Osaka University in Japan and honorary professor of mathematics in Manchester University in the U.K. He was a fellow and served on the executive committee of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. In 1989  the society awarded him the William H. Webb Medal “for outstanding contributions to education in naval architecture  marine or ocean engineering.”In 1996  the year he retired  Ogilvie also received an honorary doctorate from the National Technical University of Athens in celebration of his ship hydrodynamics research.Ogilvie was married to Joan Husselton Ogilvie for almost 63 years  until her death in 2013. They travelled the world together and raised three children. He is survived his daughter  Nancy Ogilvie; his daughter  Beth Ogilvie  and her married partner  Susan Straghalis; and his son  Ken Ogilvie  and his wife  Sue Anderson. Donations may be made in Ogilvie’s name to the ACLU or the Alzheimer's Association.

Professor Emeritus János Miklós Beér dies at 95,János Miklós Beér  professor emeritus of chemical and fuel engineering and a pathbreaking researcher in the field of flames  combustion  and cleaner-burning fossil fuels  died peacefully on Dec. 8  in Winchester at the age of 95.Beér served on the MIT faculty from 1976 to 1993  helping to launch the Combustion Research Facility as part of the Institute's Energy Laboratory. In 2003  U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham awarded him the Homer H. Lowry Award  the department's highest honor  for his work leading to commercial burners that achieved high efficiencies while minimizing noxious emissions such as nitrogen oxides.“Dr. Beér has made pioneering research and development contributions for 45 years to combustion science and technology of coal  oil  and gaseous flames ” Abraham said at the award ceremony. “He has also been a major influence on industry through his publications and lectures to professionals at national and international meetings  his leadership with students on university campuses  and his service as a consultant to many power and utility companies both in the U.S. and abroad.”Beér's early years in Central Europe unfolded against a backdrop of the 20th century's most tumultuous and violent episodes. Born on Feb. 27  1923  in Budapest  Hungary  an only child to Jewish parents  he attended that city's University of Technical and Economic Sciences. But in April 1944  Beér was conscripted into the Hungarian army's labor battalion  and with the fascist Arrow Cross Party ascendant  he found himself in danger of deportation to Germany.Then fate intervened: A friend of Beér's introduced him to the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg  who had arrived in Budapest with a plan to rescue Jews. Beér eagerly joined the effort  distributing Swedish passes to Jewish prisoners in railway cattle cars before they could be shipped to concentration camps  and then helping to ferry these people to safety in diplomatically protected houses. In testimony he left to the U.S. Holocaust Museum  Beér said: "Wallenberg was very brave  but not reckless … and there was much solidarity in our group."Beér remained with the Swedish legation until the end of the war  when he was able to reunite with his wife  Marta Gabriella Csato  whom he had married in October 1944. They remained married until her death in 2017. Resuming his education  he received a first class honors degree from József Nádor University of Technology in 1950  and became a research engineer at Budapest's Heat Research Institute  as well as a lecturer at Budapest Technical University.Beér did not have long to enjoy his newly established professional life  however. When Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 to put down the popular uprising against the Communist regime  he and his wife fled from the mass arrests. They landed as refugees in Scotland  where Beér found employment with Babcock and Wilcox Ltd. In 1957  the couple moved to England  and soon Beér was completing his doctorate at the University of Sheffield. After receiving his PhD in 1960  Beér took a position with the International Flame Research Foundation (IFRF) in Ijmuiden  the Netherlands.As head of station at the IFRF  a global research hub for the industrial combustion community  "János performed with distinction " noted Philip Sharman  current IFRF director. He led a team of investigators "in a great deal of pioneering research on the aerodynamics and mixing in isothermal jet flames. … "In 1963  Beér left to become a professor of fuel science at Penn State University. He then returned to the University of Sheffield  where he served on the faculty and later as head of the school's department of chemical engineering and fuel technology. He was awarded a doctorate of science there in 1968  and also served as dean of engineering from 1973 to 1976  when he was recruited to MIT as professor of chemical and fuel engineering.Throughout his career  Beér focused on improving electric power generation from fossil fuels  hoping to gain efficiency  lower costs  and reduce emissions. Even after his retirement from MIT  he pursued these goals  publishing in journals well into his 80s. During his career  Beér authored more than 300 articles  co-authored "Combustion Aerodynamics"(Applied Science Publishers  1972)  a foundational textbook of the era that characterized flow patterns in flames and furnaces.Amongst his numerous honors  Beér received the Knight’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic for his support of Hungarian higher education and research. In 2012  Beér received the Worcester Reed Warner Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his achievements  including such firsts as using water model studies as an analogy for describing combustion systems; detailing scaling laws for use in combustors and furnaces; studying single droplet combustion; and developing processes for reducing NOx emissions from a range of combustion sources."Beér was a giant in his field of combustion " said Gregory Stephanopoulos  the Willard Henry Dow Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering. But he was not just an accomplished researcher. Colleagues recall a friend distinguished by a certain old-world charm.Paula Hammond  the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering and head of the MIT chemical engineering department  recalls: “I knew János personally as he was my next door office suitemate when I started as a faculty member. He was the ultimate gentleman  warm  kind and ever thoughtful — asking me about my work and offering his support for me as a new junior faculty member.“Although Janos will always be known for his many outstanding achievements in establishing and expanding the area of combustion engineering  his lasting contributions are his many past students  who were inspired and influenced by his mentorship ” Hammond says.Yiannis A. Levendis  distinguished professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University remembers Beér's arrival for a PhD student's thesis defense  when Beér carefully fastened a pin on his ascot. "The occasion of such an important event in a student's life called for respectful formality " Beér told Levendis.Adds Stephanopoulos: "As a true Hungarian  he appreciated good coffee and had mastered the full art of brewing temperature  duration  and amount of coffee to get a perfect cup.""At the age of 95  I have known a lot of professors " says Edward W. Merrill  the C.P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering  emeritus. "János was a delightful  warm person — a great gentleman as well as teacher."Details for a memorial service will be shared as soon as they become available.
Lisa Peattie  professor emerita of urban studies and planning  dies at 94,Lisa Peattie  a celebrated scholar and a lifelong activist who was a professor emerita of urban anthropology in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning and recipient of the ACSP Distinguished Educator Award  passed away on Dec. 13  2018. She was 94.Peattie was born in Chicago and raised in Illinois  Mexico  and Guatemala. Her international upbringing amid her parents’ fieldwork in Morelos and Yucatán  Mexico  nurtured an early interest in the connections among academic disciplines.She studied anthropology at the University of Chicago  earning her doctorate in 1968.Peattie joined the MIT faculty in 1963 with the goal of pushing anthropology out of the realm of pure social science and into the arena of action and advocacy  by including the researcher’s moral positions and the interests of the individuals being studied. She was one of the first female faculty members to gain tenure at MIT.In 1962 Peattie and her husband  Roderick Peattie  moved to South America to help document the efforts of the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies to plan a new city in the interior of Venezuela. Her experiences in the field and her observations of the difficulties faced by those living at the margins of the new city led to her pathbreaking book  “The View from the Barrio” (University of Michigan Press). The volume raised planners’ awareness of the way that the plans they imagined actually affected people at the margins.“Lisa was an unorthodox urban anthropologist who strongly believed that governmental interventions in the lives of the urban poor usually reduce the autonomy of the poor ” says Bish Sanyal  the Ford Professor of Urban Development and Planning. “She came to this conclusion by living with the poor and by observing from below how poor families coped with socioeconomic changes.”Following the death of her husband in 1963  Peattie returned to Boston to teach full time at MIT. During her career at the Institute  Peattie remained a tenacious activist  protesting frequently against the Vietnam War during the 1960s and early 1970s  against nuclear proliferation in the 1980s and 1990s  and most recently as part of the Occupy movement in the early 2010s.In 1966  she was part of the original group of students and faculty from MIT and Harvard that created Urban Planning Aid (UPA). This organization was the first advocacy planning firm in America. Peattie and her colleagues offered technical assistance and promoted empowerment in low-income communities faced with housing  health  safety  and representation challenges. UPA helped residents of Boston and Cambridge halt the proposed construction of the Inner Belt highway  fight evictions. and prevent the demolition of housing.“Lisa was my professor at MIT in both the MCP program and later for my PhD ” says Anna Hardman MCP ’71  PhD ’88. “I learned so much from Lisa’s insight  ideas  and enthusiasm‚ and from her commitment to important causes‚ lessons I re-learned when I worked for Urban Planning Aid in the 1970s. Lisa was wise  always thoughtful  and her contribution to women in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning was vital.”In 1999  the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning presented Peattie with the profession’s highest teaching honor  its Distinguished Educator Award. The award recognized her scholarly accomplishments as well as the impact of her work as an applied anthropologist and activist.Peattie raised four children: Christopher Peattie (husband of Denise Hood)  who predeceased her in 2011; and Sara Peattie  Miranda Clemson  and Julia Peattie. She also leaves two grandchildren  Chris Clemson and Ella Beaver. She is survived by her brother  James Redfield  and his wife  Kathy Atlass.“Widowed young in a foreign country with four children  our mother continued to approach life with zest and courage  traveling overland up the Pan-American Highway from Panama to New England in a Jeep with her children and a parrot ” say her daughters. “Our mother was a woman capable of enthralling a class of graduate students  planting a vegetable garden  baking bread  and painting the bedroom ceiling all in the same day. Often exasperating  she was never dull. She threw great parties and was a mean dancer. In later years her body flagged but her spirit  never. Her curiosity about the world never dimmed.”
Ernst Frankel  shipping expert and professor emeritus of ocean engineering  dies at 95,Ernst G. Frankel MME ’60  SM ‘60  professor emeritus of ocean engineering who served on MIT’s faculty for 36 years  passed away on Nov. 18 at the age of 95. Frankel  who was also a former professor of management at the Sloan School of Management  was a leading expert in shipping  shipbuilding  and port management.Born in 1923 in Beuthen  Germany  Frankel served in the Royal Navy during World War II. He also served in the Israeli navy in 1948. After the war  he pursued his bachelor’s degree in marine engineering at London University. He worked for eight years as chief engineer of Zim Navigation Company in Israel  before moving to America and enrolling in MIT to study ocean engineering.He graduated MIT in 1960 with a master’s of science in ocean engineering and a master’s of marine mechanical engineering. In his graduate thesis  he examined the effects of surge  pitch  and heave on semisubmerged displacement vessels in regular waves. After graduating  he joined the faculty of the then-named Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. He remained on the faculty until his retirement in 1995.Throughout his career  Frankel authored 21 books and over 700 academic papers. In 1971  he was named head of the Interdepartmental Commodity Transportation and Economic Development Laboratory  which he also helped establish.In addition to his work at MIT  Frankel acted as an advisor to a number of governments  international organizations  and shipping companies. He was a member of the Board of Directors of Neptune Orient Lines  one of the world’s largest shipping companies  as well as an advisor to the Panama Canal Authority. He also served as a port  shipping  and aviation advisor to the World Bank  a senior advisor on ports to the secretary general of the International Maritime Organization  and a member of the U.N.-sponsored World Maritime University’s Visiting Committee.Frankel received a number of accolades throughout his career including a Gold Medal from the government of Great Britain in 1956. He was also a member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers and the Transportation Science Section Council.In the 1970s and 1980s  Frankel expanded his expertise beyond ocean engineering and naval architecture  setting his sights on business and economics. He earned a master’s of business administration in operations management and a doctor of business administration in systems management from Boston University. He also received a PhD in transport economics from the University of Wales in 1985.This foundation in economics and business management led to a dual appointment in the Sloan School of Management. In addition to acting as professor of ocean engineering  in the early 1990s Frankel was named a professor of management at Sloan.After his retirement in 1995  Frankel remained active in both teaching and research. When Elon Musk announced the Hyperloop concept in 2013  Frankel received some unexpected media attention for research he conducted two decades prior. In the early 1990s  Frankel led a team that designed a vacuum tube which could possibly enable travel between Boston and New York City in 40 minutes — a concept similar to what Musk has been hoping to achieve.Inan interviewwith the BBC in 2014  Frankel said  “The advantage of a vacuum tube is that you can achieve high speeds. … We built a half-mile long tube at the playing fields of MIT  evacuated it  and then shot things through it in order to measure what sort of velocities we could obtain.”Funeral services were held in Brookline  Massachusetts  on Nov. 20.
Remembering Professor Emeritus Alan McWhorter  1930-2018,Alan L. McWhorter  a longtime professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and an administrator and researcher at MIT Lincoln Laboratory  has died in New Orleans  Louisiana. He was 87.His family said his death was unexpected despite some recent health problems. A memorial service will be held at a later date.McWhorter is best known for his research in electronic and quantum devices including transistors  lasers  and masers. In 1955  he developed the McWhorter model for low-frequency flicker (or 1/f) noise caused by surface effects in semiconductor devices. The model  sometimes called “the McWhorter effect ” continues to be widely cited today. In the mid-1960s  he received three patents related to semiconductors.However  according to MIT colleague Paul Penfield Jr.  his range of interests was broader and extended in many dimensions. “Al’s lesser-known but still pioneering work included aspects of control systems  power semiconductors  infrared detection  and optical communications ” said Penfield  an emeritus professor and former EECS department head. “But besides his technical breadth  he understood both the theoretical and experimental sides of engineering  cared about both the pedagogy and applications of various technologies  and promoted short-term applied research along with long-range curiosity-driven research.”Long legacy at MITBorn in Crowley  Louisiana  on Aug. 25  1930  McWhorter began his education in New Orleans at Tulane University’s School of Engineering  then transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  receiving a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1951. He received an ScD degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1955.McWhorter joined the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering as an assistant professor in 1959  served as an associate professor from 1960 to 1966  and as a full professor until he retired in 1996. During his time with EE (now EECS)  he supervised more than 30 students’ work on their master’s  PhD  and ScD theses. With a generous donation  he established a fellowship fund  the Alan L. McWhorter (1955) Fund  to support graduate students studying electrical engineeringMcWhorter was also affiliated with the Solid State Division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for more than 40 years  beginning as a staff member in 1955. He served as assistant division head and associate head between 1962 and 1965  when he was named to head the division. He served as division head for 29 years  becoming a Lincoln Laboratory Fellow in 1994 and retiring in 1996.“Al was a warm  generous  and inspiring colleague ” recalled Erich Ippen  a principal investigator at MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and a professor emeritus of both electrical engineering and physics. “As an early leader in quantum electronics  he was a valuable mentor for us younger researchers in that area on campus as well as at Lincoln Lab.”Frederick Leonberger knew McWhorter in both MIT roles. “I had the good fortune of having Al as my doctoral thesis advisor. His insightful guidance and high standards not only inspired me in my research  but also provided an excellent model for conducting and managing the research process ” said Leonberger  who is now a principal with EOvation Advisors. “At Lincoln Laboratory  where I subsequently worked  his leadership — as well as the range of research topics he had expertise in and contributed to — provided a role model of technical excellence for the staff  and helped enable the many important technical achievements of the division over the years.”Many MIT colleagues still recall that  in 1969  McWhorter was involved in a near-fatal collision in Arlington  Massachusetts  sustaining a skull fracture  a concussion  eye and facial injuries  and many broken bones. But four months later  after seven operations and multiple setbacks  he walked out of Massachusetts General Hospital  returning to work at MIT soon after. He also returned to hiking and mountain-climbing  beginning with a trip to the Grand Tetons one year after his release from the hospital.Patent particularsMcWhorter received his first two patents  both for semiconductor switching matrixes  in 1963 and 1964  at a time when researchers were experimenting with a variety of ways for using semiconductors in computers. The patents describe the development of the cryosar  one of the early semiconductor memory devices. Semiconductor memory (such as RAM) is now ubiquitous in electronics.The third  and arguably most historically significant patent  came in 1966. It reflected McWhorter’s involvement as a member of one of three teams that had nearly simultaneously demonstrated the first semiconductor laser (then called an infrared maser). Today  semiconductor lasers are used in devices ranging from DVD players to laser pointers to printers to tattoo-removal devices.Professional recognitionIn 1958  McWhorter and two colleagues received the National Electronics Conference Annual Award for their technical paper on solid-state masers.McWhorter was also a long-time member of the IEEE  a leading technical professional organization. In 1968  he was named an IEEE Fellow  a distinction reserved for select members with extraordinary accomplishments. The IEEE recognized McWhorter “for contributions to control theory and its applications to switch power systems and image processing.” In 1971  McWhorter received the IEEE David Sarnoff Award  which recognizes exceptional work in electronics  “for outstanding contributions leading to a better understanding of semiconductor devices.” In 2000  he won an IEEE Third Millennium Medal “for contributions to control theory and its applications to switch power systems and image processing.” He was one of just 45 members of the IEEE Electron Devices Society to be so honored.In 1993  he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for “outstanding research and technical leadership in the fields of quantum electronics and solid-state devices.” He was also a long-time fellow of the American Physical Society  and a member of the scientific and engineering societies Sigma Xi  Tau Beta Pi  and Eta Kappa Nu (HKN).McWhorter also authored or co-authored dozens of scientific articles and hundreds of reports  contributed to several books  and served as an editor on two IEEE publications.Professor emeritusAfter retiring in 1996  he returned to the New Orleans area and again began participating in Tulane activities  such as the Friends of Music  the Summer Lyric Theatre  and the Emeritus Club and Educational Conference offerings of the Alumni House. McWhorter  who died on July 11  2018  is survived in the New Orleans area by niece Patricia McWhorter (Peter C. Broussard); nephews David McWhorter (Lisa) and Steven McWhorter (Renee)  and six grandnieces: Olivia Broussard (Lucien Weiss);  Allyson McWhorter; Brindley McWhorter; Rebecca McWhorter Ruegge (Gene); Elizabeth McWhorter Guillory (Dakota); and Emily McWhorter Menendez (Colin). A private memorial service will be held in New Orleans at a later date.Gifts in memory of Alan McWhorter may be made to MIT via the Alan L. McWhorter (1955) Fund  account #3304350.Credit-card gifts can be made atgiving.mit.edu/alan-mcwhorter.

Professor Emerita Catherine Chvany  Slavic scholar  dies at 91,Professor Emerita Catherine Vakar Chvany  a renowned Slavic linguist and literature scholar who played a pivotal role in advancing the study of Russian language and literature in MIT’s Foreign Languages and Literatures Section (now Global Studies and Languages)  died on Oct. 19 in Watertown  Massachusetts. She was 91.Chvany served on the MIT faculty for 26 years before her retirement in 1993.Global Studies and Languages head Emma Teng noted that MIT’s thriving Russian studies curriculum today is a legacy of Chvany’s foundational work in the department. And  Maria Khotimsky  senior lecturer in Russian  said  “Several generations of Slavists are grateful for Professor Chvany’s inspiring mentorship  while her works in Slavic poetics and linguistics are renowned in the U.S. and internationally.”A prolific and influential scholarA prolific scholar  Chvany wrote "On the Syntax of Be-Sentences in Russian" (Slavica Publishers  1975); and co-edited four volumes: "New Studies in Russian Language and Literature" (Slavica  1987); "Morphosyntax in Slavic" (Slavica  1980); "Slavic Transformational Syntax" (University of Michigan  1974); and "Studies in Poetics: Commemorative Volume: Krystyna Pomorska" (Slavica Publishers  1995).In 1996  linguists Olga Yokoyama and Emily Klenin published an edited collection of her work  "Selected Essays of Catherine V. Chvany" (Slavica).In her articles  Chvany took up a range of issues in linguistics  including not only variations on the verb “to be” but also hierarchies of situations in syntax of agents and subjects; definiteness in Bulgarian  English  and Russian; other issues of lexical storage and transitivity; hierarchies in Russian cases; and issues of markedness  including an important overview  “The Evolution of the Concept of Markedness from the Prague Circle to Generative Grammar.”In literature she took up language issues in the classic "Tale of Igor's Campaign " Teffi’s poems  Nikolai Leskov’s short stories  and a novella by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.From Paris to Cambridge“Catherine Chvany was always so present that it is hard to think of her as gone ” said MIT Literature Professor Ruth Perry. “She had strong opinions and wasn't afraid to speak out about them.”Chvany was born on April 2  1927  in Paris  France  to émigré Russian parents. During World War II  she and her younger sister Anna were sent first to the Pyrenees and then to the United States with assistance from a courageous young Unitarian minister’s wife  Martha Sharp.Fluent in Russian and French  Chvany quickly mastered English. She graduated from the Girls’ Latin School in Boston in 1946 and attended Radcliffe College from 1946 to 1948. She left school to marry Lawrence Chvany and raise three children  Deborah  Barbara  and Michael.In 1961-63  she returned to school and completed her undergraduate degree in linguistics at Harvard University. She received her PhD in Slavic languages and literatures from Harvard in 1970 and began her career as an instructor of Russian language at Wellesley College in 1966.She joined the faculty at MIT in 1967 and became an assistant professor in 1971  an associate professor in 1974  and a full professor in 1983.Warmth  generosity  and friendshipHistorian Philip Khoury  who was dean of the School of Humanities  Arts and Social Sciences during the latter years of Chvany’s time at MIT  remembered her warmly as “a wonderful colleague who loved engaging with me on language learning and how the MIT Russian language studies program worked.”Elizabeth Wood  a professor of Russian history  recalled the warm welcome that Chvany gave her when she came to MIT in 1990: “She always loved to stop and talk at the Tuesday faculty lunches  sharing stories of her life and her love of Slavic languages.”Chvany’s influence was broad and longstanding  in part as a result of her professional affiliations. Chvany served on the advisory or editorial boards of "Slavic and East European Journal " "Russian Language Journal " "Journal of Slavic Linguistics " "Peirce Seminar Papers " "Essays in Poetics" (United Kingdom)  and "Supostavitelno ezikoznanie" (Bulgaria).Emily Klenin  an emerita professor of Slavic languages and literature at the University of California at Los Angeles  noted that Chvany had a practice of expressing gratitude to those whom she mentored. She connected that practice to Chvany’s experience of being aided during WWII. “Her warm and open attitude toward life was reflected in her continuing interest and friendship for the young people she mentored  even when  as most eventually did  they went on to lives involving completely different academic careers or even no academic career at all ” Klenin said.Memorial reception at MIT on November 18Chvany is survived by her children  Deborah Gyapong and her husband Tony of Ottawa  Canada; Barbara Chvany and her husband Ken Silbert of Orinda  California; and Michael Chvany and his wife Sally of Arlington  Massachusetts; her foster-brother  William Atkinson of Cambridge  Massachusetts; six grandchildren; and nine great grandchildren.A memorial reception will be held on Sunday  Nov. 18  from 1:30 to 4:00 p.m. in the Samberg Conference Center  7th floor. Donations in Chvany’s name may be made to the Unitarian Universalist Association. VisitFriends of the UUAfor online donations.

Dana Mead PhD ’67  former chair of the MIT Corporation  dies at 82,Dana G. Mead PhD ’67  a prominent business leader  military officer  former White House official  and professor who served as chair of the MIT Corporation from 2003 until 2010  died on Oct. 31 in Boston.Mead was a forward-looking leader at MIT who helped oversee a period of significant advancement  as the Institute expanded its research interests and took landmark steps to diversify the campus community  while remaining at the leading edge of engineering  science  and innovation.During Mead’s tenure as the Corporation’s ninth chair  MIT broadened its research portfolio to include increased investment in the life sciences  and launched new centers such as the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). The Institute also grew its international research programs and global engagement  and  under Mead’s supervision  hired its first female president  Susan Hockfield  who was also the first life scientist to hold the position."When Dana Mead chaired the MIT Corporation  I was provost  so I had the immense privilege of learning from his wonderful leadership style and observing his intense commitment to sustaining MIT’s excellence  especially through bringing fresh perspectives to the Visiting Committees ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “He understood as well as anyone that the Institute is a system — and that the quality of our Visiting Committees drives the quality of the whole enterprise. MIT continues to reap the benefits of his insight and thoughtful service.”Hockfield also recalls Mead’s impact at the Institute: “I had the very great fortune to have Dana Mead at my side  as chair of the MIT Corporation  when I embarked on my service as MIT’s president ” she says. “Dana advised and encouraged me  generously sharing the prodigious wisdom he had gained over the course of a lifetime of service and leadership. He quickly became my trusted advisor. Dana deftly but unambiguously established lines of governance  strengthening the roles of both the Corporation and Institute leadership  to MIT’s great benefit.”Additionally  Hockfield says  Mead’s personal qualities were an integral part of his leadership style.“But even while Dana instructed us  he also amused us ” Hockfield says. “When a discussion had gone on too long  he often observed  ‘Everything has been said  but not everyone has had a chance to say it.’ With his wisdom and warmth  and his discipline and depth of curiosity  Dana Mead devotedly served MIT.”As one product of Mead’s focus on diversity  the number of women serving as Corporation members grew by around 50 percent during his tenure  while representation by foreign members also increased by nearly 50 percent.In 2009  Mead announced he would step aside as chairperson  in keeping with the Corporation’s by-laws  which require that members do not serve past age 75.“I will miss working in this very vibrant and dynamic environment — the students  faculty  administrators  alumni and the like ” he said at the time. Mead then became a Corporation life member  emeritus.Dana George Mead was born in Cresco  Iowa. His long and diverse career in leadership roles included phases in the military  government  private sector  and academia. Mead graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1957 with a BS in engineering  and then served as an Army officer in many roles for over two decades  including assignments as a troop leader in Germany  and a combatant and strategist in Vietnam.In 1967  Mead completed his PhD studies in MIT’s Department of Political Science  having been selected for a fellowship as an officer. His dissertation  “United States peacetime strategic planning  1920-1941: the color plans to the victory program ” examined the ways the U.S. military planned for the “next war” in the years following World War I  until the start of World War II.After completing his academic work  Mead transitioned to government positions  including a fellowship in the White House Fellows program. He wrote military reports  and later served as the White House’s deputy director of the Domestic Council during the Nixon administration. He left Washington in 1974 to take a professorship back at the United States Military Academy.“Other than his wife of 60 years  Nancy  and his family  our dad was most passionate about his varied and longstanding relationships with three great American institutions; MIT  West Point  and the White House Fellows Program ” says Dana Mead Jr.  one of Mead’s sons.Mead then moved into the private sector  forging a highly successful career in industrial management. Notably  for most of the 1990s  he was chair and CEO of Tenneco Inc.  the conglomerate with businesses in oil and gas transmission  shipbuilding  auto parts  packaging  chemicals  and more. Mead oversaw the expansion of Tenneco’s operations across the globe and a concurrent rise in productivity and profitability at the company.Mead recounted and analyzed many of these experiences at Tenneco in his 2000 book  “High Standards  Hard Choices ” which frankly analyzed the his time in the executive suite and offered a look at his pragmatic style.“There is no rocket science in quality management ” Mead wrote in the book. “Getting it right the first time  satisfying customers  reducing variations in process  and continually improving products is just common sense in business.”At the same time  he wrote  “you will discover a lot of talent buried in the organization at all levels ” and allowing talent a chance to thrive is important. Such people  he adds  “not only know how to work the valves and switches in the middle of the night  but they probably have a lot of ideas on how to do it better. You have to put your ear to the ground and listen carefully to identify the people who are looked to and respected by their peers.”As an extension of his corporate leadership roles  Mead served terms as chair of the National Association of Manufacturers from 1995 to 1997  and of the Business Roundtable from 1998 to 1999. He also served on the boards of Pfizer  Zurich  Textron  and Cummins.Additionally  Mead was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009  and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He served on the board of the Pardee RAND Graduate School  the School for Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. He also served on the National Board of Governors for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  a long-time philanthropic interest.Mead is survived by his wife  Nancy  as well as his two sons  Dana Jr. and Mark; his daughters-in-law D-Arcy and Susie; his brother  Michael  and sister-in-law  Anna; and seven grandsons.Funeral services will be held at the Old Cadet Chapel at the West Point Cemetery  at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point  New York  at 10 a.m. on Nov. 20. Donations in his name can be made to the Boys and Girls Club of America.To honor Mead’s memory  the flags on MIT’s Killian Court will fly at half-staff Nov. 13-16.
Professor Emeritus Sylvain Bromberger  philosopher of language and science  dies at 94,Professor Emeritus Sylvain Bromberger  a philosopher of language and of science who played a pivotal role in establishing MIT’s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy  died on Sept. 16 in Cambridge  Massachusetts. He was 94.A faculty member for more than 50 years  Bromberger helped found the department in 1977 and headed the philosophy section for several years. He officially retired in 1993 but remained very active at MIT until his death.Kindness and intellectual generosity“Although he officially retired 25 years ago  Sylvain was an active and valued member of the department up to the very end ” said Alex Byrne  head of the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. “He made enduring contributions to philosophy and linguistics  and his colleagues and students were frequent beneficiaries of his kindness and intellectual generosity. He had an amazing life in so many ways  and MIT is all the better for having been a part of it.”Paul Egré  director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (aka CNRS) and a former visiting scholar at MIT  said  “Those of us who were lucky enough to know Sylvain have lost the dearest of friends  a unique voice  a distinctive smile and laugh  someone who yet seemed to know that life is vain and fragile in unsuspected ways  but also invaluable in others.”Enduring contribution to fundamental issues about knowledgeBromberger’s work centered largely on fundamental issues in epistemology  namely the theory of knowledge and the conditions that make knowledge possible or impossible. During the course of his career  he devoted a substantial part of his thinking to an examination of the ways in which we come to apprehend unsolved questions. His research in the philosophy of linguistics  carried out in part with the late Institute Professor Morris Halle of the linguistics section  included investigations into the foundations of phonology and of morphology.Born in 1924 in Antwerp to a French-speaking Jewish family  Bromberger escaped the German invasion of Belgium with his parents and two brothers on May 10  1940. After reaching Paris  then Bordeaux  his family obtained one of the last visas issued by the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes in Bayonne. Bromberger later dedicated the volume of his collected papers "On What We Know We Don’t Know: Explanation  Theory  Linguistics  and How Questions Shape Them" (University of Chicago Press  1992) to Sousa Mendes.The family fled to New York  and Bromberger was admitted to Columbia University. However  he chose to join the U.S. Army in 1942  and he went on to serve three years in the infantry. He took part in the liberation of Europe as a member of the 405th Regiment  102nd Infantry Division. He was wounded during the invasion of Germany in 1945.After leaving the Army  Bromberger studied physics and the philosophy of science at Columbia University  earning his bachelor’s degree in 1948. He received his PhD in philosophy from Harvard University in 1961.Research and teaching at MITHe served on the philosophy faculties at Princeton University and at the University of Chicago before joining MIT in 1966. Over the years  he trained many generations of MIT students  teaching alongside such notables as Halle  Noam Chomsky  Thomas Kuhn  and Ken Hale.In the early part of his career  Bromberger focused on critiquing the so-called deductive-nomological model of explanation  which says that to explain a phenomenon is to deductively derive the statement reporting that phenomenon from laws (universal generalizations) and antecedent conditions. For example  we can explain that this water boils from the law that all water boils at 100 degrees C  and that the temperature of the water was elevated to exactly 100 C.An influential article: Why-questionsOne simple though key observation made by Bromberger in his analysis was that we may not only explain that the water boils at 100 C  but also how it boils  and even why it boils when heated up. This feature gradually led Bromberger to think about the semantics and pragmatics of questions and their answers.Bromberger’s 1966 “Why-questions” paper was probably his most influential article. In it  he highlights the fact that most scientifically valid questions put us at first in a state in which we know all actual answers to the question to be false  but in which we can nevertheless recognize the question to have a correct answer (a state he calls “p-predicament ” with “p” for “puzzle”). According to Bromberger  why-questions are particularly emblematic of this state of p-predicament  because in order to ask a why-question rationally  a number of felicity conditions (or presuppositions) must be satisfied  which are discussed in his work.The paper had an influence on ulterior accounts of explanation  notably Bas van Fraassen’s discussion of the semantic theory of contrastivism in his book "The Scientific Image" (to explain a phenomenon is to answer a why-question with a contrast class in mind). Still today  why-questions are recognized as questions whose semantics is hard to specify  in part for reasons Bromberger discussed.In addition to investigating the syntactic  semantic  and pragmatic analysis of interrogatives  Bromberger also immersed himself in generative linguistics  with a particular interest in generative phonology  and the methodology of linguistic theory  teaching a seminar on the latter with Thomas Kuhn.A lifelong engagement with new ideasIn 1993  the MIT Press published a collection of essays in linguistics to honor Bromberger on the occasion of his retirement. "The View From Building 20 " edited by Ken Hale and Jay Keyser  featured essays by Chomsky  Halle  Alec Marantz  and other distinguished colleagues.In 2017  Egré and Robert May put together a workshop honoring Bromberger at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Talks there centered on themes from Bromberger’s work  including metacognition  questions  linguistic theory  and problems concerning word individuation.Tributes were read  notably this one from Chomsky  who used to take walks with Bromberger when they taught together:“Those walks were a high point of the day for many years … almost always leaving me with the same challenging question: Why? Which I’ve come to think of as Sylvain’s question. And leaving me with the understanding that it is a question we should always ask when we have surmounted some barrier in inquiry and think we have an answer  only to realize that we are like mountain climbers who think they see the peak but when they approach it find that it still lies tantalizingly beyond.”Egré noted that even when Bromberger was in his 90s  he had a “constant appetite for new ideas. He would always ask what your latest project was about  why it was interesting  and how you would deal with a specific problem ” Egré said. “His hope was that philosophy  linguistics  and the brain sciences would eventually join forces to uncover unprecedented dimensions of the human mind  erasing at least some of our ignorance.”Bromberger’s wife of 64 years  Nancy  died in 2014. He is survived by two sons  Allen and Daniel; and three grandchildren  Michael Barrows  Abigail Bromberger  and Eliza Bromberger.Written by Paul Egré and Kathryn O’Neill  with contributions from Daniel Bromberger  Allen Bromberger  Samuel Jay Keyser  Robert May  Agustin Rayo  Philippe Schlenker  and Benjamin Spector
Celebrating the life of Colt Richter ’16,“Flying with Colt above glaciers and between mountain peaks  I understood how he fell in love with flying  and why he was so excited to share that with others.”Sam Parker ’15 wrote that about his late friend and classmate Colt Richter ’16. He added that Richter  who died this past July when the small plane he was piloting crashed in Alaska  relished service above all else and often refused to claim credit or recognition  “as his humility wouldn't allow it.”Another close companion  MIT alumnus Dylan Soukup ’14  echoed such a sentiment  writing that Richter had “a love of helping others  a passion for selflessness” and a deep connection to the breathtaking natural beauty of his native state of Alaska. As a newly arrived first-year student  Richter said inan interview for MIT Newsthat one of the things he anticipated missing most about his home was the view.“I can look out my window and see mountains ” said Richter  who went on to earn a degree in mechanical engineering. “In Boston  it’s really  really flat.”Judging by how he embraced his time on and around campus  Richter managed to adjust to the more linear landscape. He joined the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity  sung in the Ohms a cappella group  and served as a volunteer emergency medical technician for MIT EMS. He served on MIT’s student-run ambulance service during all four of his years on campus  and as a junior he became the chief and built close ties to members of the MIT Police.Richter also served as a student member of the Presidential Advisory Cabinet. MIT President L. Rafael Reif expressed fond memories  saying “Colt was one of the most exceptional students to serve.”“He was thoughtful  warm  and wise  and he cared deeply about MIT's students ” President Reif said. “As we mourn Colt's tragic loss  we are grateful for the time he spent on our campus. He was a special young man  and he made all of MIT better and stronger.”Richter had planned to put all of his MIT experiences to good use  as he had long expressed a dream of becoming an orthopedic surgeon. He had been accepted to medical school at the University of Washington and was due to start this past August. Richter spent the past two gap years flying commercially throughout Alaska.His passion for aviation is hard to overstate. All of his friends commented that he was most comfortable in the air and made those with him equally so.Richter received his pilot’s license at just 17  allowing him  said close friend and fellow aviation enthusiast Matt Guthmiller ’18  to “fly a wider variety of airplanes and in more diverse environments in 24 years than many pilots do in a lifetime.” Not surprisingly  he even taught a flying class at MIT.Flying was a family affair too  as Richter’s father flew as did his grandfather  who was a fighter pilot in World War II prior to becoming a commercial airline pilot. When Richter was not in the air  he was exploring all the places travel could take him  enjoying hiking in the remote outdoors as well as fishing  skiing  or skydiving.As busy as he was — Guthmiller noted his classmate’s talent playing piano  guitar  and singing — Richter made finding time for others his greatest priority.“He was the kind of person who  despite keeping extremely busy  was never too busy for friends or family ” Guthmiller said. “He cared deeply about the people around him  took care of them  had a tremendous amount of fun  and simply made you want to be a better person.”Tom Troxel  a lifelong Alaskan friend who considered Richter a brother  conveyed the value his friend placed on family.“We lived at each other’s houses and in the summers  we would sneak off to our cabins every chance we could. Whether we were debating constitutional law or getting up to no good at Big Lake  Colt always knew how to put a smile on my face and he always had a big grin spread across his ” Troxel said. “He was part of my family and I was part of his. After graduating from MIT  Colt came back to Alaska  partially so he could fly full-time but more importantly so he could spend more time with his dad and mom. I remember talking to him so many times since he moved back home about how important it was for him to be in Alaska with them — he loved Cathy and Rick so very much.”In the words of his parents  Cathy and Rick Richter: “Colt was our only child and the perfect son to us. We miss him deeply and are so appreciative of the loving support we have received throughout this difficult time.”Richter  at once grounded and in the clouds  carved out a path for others to follow. His parents noted that dozens of those who knew him whether near or far  did not hesitate to come to Alaska for the service and celebration of his life. For all of his talent  drive  and interests  a simple wish from those who loved him said it all: “Fly high my friend.”A celebration of life event  led by MIT Reverend Kristin Boswell-Ford  will take place Nov. 16 at 3 p.m. in the MIT Chapel.The Colt Thomas Richter (2016) Scholarship Fund has been established by Colt’s parents at MIT.

Professor Emeritus Bernard Burke  astrophysics pioneer  dies at 90,Bernard F. “Bernie” Burke’50  PhD ’53  the William A.M. Burden Professor of Astrophysics Emeritus and a principal investigator at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research  was an innovator whose research into radio astronomy stretched our view into the farthest reaches of the universe. He passed away on Aug. 5 at age 90.A former chair of the Department of Physics’ Astrophysics Division  Burke's most notable achievements included the discovery of decametric radio noise from Jupiter — for which he earned the 1963Helen B. Warner Prizeof the American Astronomical Society — and the firstEinstein Ring  the deformation of light in the form of a ring around a massive cosmic object due to gravitational lensing. He played a key role in developingvery long baseline interferometry (VLBI) which allows high-resolution imaging of cosmic structures  and theVery Large Array (VLA)radio telescope  to aid in his research of gravitational lenses  quasars  and galaxies. Burke is the co-author  along with Francis Graham-Smith  of “Introduction to Radio Astronomy ” now in its 3rd edition.“Those of us who have been here a while remember many decades of his humor  energy  intellect  and zest for life ” saysJacqueline Hewitt  director of the MIT Kavli Institute and one of 19 students mentored by Burke. “This is a great personal loss for me  and I know many at MKI who were close to him share my sorrow.”A longtime resident of Cambridge  Massachusetts  Bernard Flood Burke was born in Brighton  Massachuetts  on June 7  1928. His father Vincent was head of the math department at Rindge Technical High School. His mother Clare was a statistical typist who devised her own method to manually type complex math formulas.When he was young  he would sit for hours doing math problems. At 16  he and a high school friend purchased a large piece of glass to grind it into a telescope’s lens. “They enjoyed the challenge involved to shape it and grind it correctly ” says his sister  Sally Berenson.After graduating from Lexington High School  he turned down a major conservatory’s full scholarship to study the violin  and chose to study at MIT. With the Cold War was starting  he joined the ROTC’s Signal Corps  where he learned Russian  worked under a decryption specialist  and was promoted to first lieutenant. He also worked onProject Hartwell  a U.S. Navy-MIT collaboration that researched long-range underwater acoustic detection sensors for anti-submarine warfare.He received his PhD in 1953  studying physics and astrophysics  with a focus on microwave spectroscopy  and joined theCarnegie Institution of Washington’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism(DTM)  as a radio astronomer. He designed and constructed radio interferometers  radiometers  and radio telescopes under DTM directorMerle Tuve.In 1955  he and his colleagueKenneth Franklinset out to map the northern sky using a radio antenna array  with receivers in the rural 96-acre Mills Cross field  near Washington. One night they heard a hissing sound they thought was from a passing vehicle. But when they tested the array and moved it in a southern direction  they detected bursts of radio radiation and realized that they had actually been listening to Jupiter. This was the first detection of non-thermal radio noise from a planet  and led to a new way of exploring the Solar System.“Suddenly we realized we could start to learn about planets too ” saysJim Thiemanof the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The discovery earned Burke the Warner Prize.Burke's other achievements at DTM included directing the instrumentation of its 60-foot radio telescope; conducting studies of 21-cm line hydrogen radiation from the Milky Way Galaxy; transporting a multichannel receiver to a 300-foot radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at Cornell University; studying the velocity disruption of interstellar hydrogen in the Andromeda Galaxy; and helping discover tidal distortion of the galaxy.Burke served as chair of DTM’sRadio Astronomy Sectionfrom 1962 to 1965. Later  he was a member of DTM’s visiting committee in 1994 and its firstMerle A. Tuve Senior Fellow in 1997.Back to MITIn 1965  he joined MIT as a professor of physics with tenure  and as a member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics. He served as chair of theAstrophysics Divisionfrom 1970 to 1983  and was named the William A.M. Burden Professor of Astrophysics in 1981.“One of his defining characteristics was his huge level of energy and enthusiasm  and his focus on science “ saidClaude Canizares  the Bruno B. Rossi Professor of Physics and associate director of theChandra X-ray Observatory Center.Burke joined ProfessorAlan Barrettin the study of hydroxyl masers using telescopes at Millstone Haystack Radio Observatory  and the Harvard Observatory. He directed the effort to link these telescopes to be used as interferometers. He showed that the angular sizes of the OH sources were so small that they could not be thermally excited and had to be naturally occurring masers. In 1967  this inteferometry work led to the development of VLBI  in a joint effort with NRAO and Canada’s National Research Council.VLBI used atomic frequency standards to synchronize pairs of radio telescopes around the world to study quasars and hydroxyl‐line emitters with an angular resolution 1 000 times better than previous methods. For this achievement  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences awarded him and the other participants theRumford Prizein 1971.In 1967 his MIT group was the first to conduct intercontinental VLBI  and in 1970 the first to extend the technique to the 1.35-cm water vapor line  showing that water emission  like hydroxyl emission  came from what he called “extraordinarily energetic and compact sources.”Burke led the first Russian-U.S. VLBI experiment to measure the angular size of H2O masers  in 1971. Jim Moran  the Donald H. Menzel Professor of Astrophysics Emeritus at Harvard University  recalled conspiring with Burke to carry a live atomic clock on a flight from Paris to Moscow.“This was necessary in the Cold War days  and long before the GPS era  in order to synchronize the station clock at the telescope in Russia with its counterpart at the U.S. telescope to an accuracy of better than a microsecond " Moran recalls. “It was a real swashbuckling adventure."In 1970  Burke began a campaign to extend VLBI methods into space. He was a major participant in the first three successful VLBI space missions where orbiting radio telescopes operated with arrays of telescopes on the ground to produce images of radio sources of unprecedented resolution: The connection of the TDRSS satellite into a ground-based network in the late 1980s  the Japanese-led VSOP/Halca project launched in 1997  and the Russian-led RadioAstron project launched in 2011 and still operating.Burke participated in an MIT group that helped develop theVery Large Array (VLA)  at the time the largest  most expensive ground-based astronomical instrument ever built when it was completed in 1980. He used the VLA to study gravitational lenses.Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicted that massive objects could bend light rays passing nearby. The first example of this gravitational lensing effect outside the solar system was found in 1979  when Burke made this a major focus of his research. His team used the VLA to measure the time delay between components of the first known lensing object  0957+561  to estimate the value of the Hubble Constant  which characterizes the age of the universe. Einstein suggested that if a bright object were positioned precisely behind a massive body  then a perfectly symmetric form of lensing would be produced; however  he predicted that such an event would be highly unlikely. Nonetheless  Burke  Hewitt  and others discovered this effect in 1988  which is now referred to by scientists as an “Einstein ring.” Teaming up with scientists from Princeton University and Caltech  they conducted a huge search for additional Einstein rings with the VLA and created an archive of more than 400 maps from the survey. At the NRAO  he led a series ofMIT-Green Bank 5-GHz surveysthat compiled thousands of radio sources in the sky using the 300-foot Green Bank telescope in West Virginia and detected gravitational lenses.As a professor  he challenged his students on and off campus before retiring in the mid-1990s.“Bernie was my PhD advisor  and he taught me many things ” recalls Hewitt. “Radio astronomy of course  but also sort of how to sail (we did capsize on occasion)  and most importantly his superlatively positive approach to life I believe rubbed off on me a bit.”In recent years he continued to attend division and department events  scientific talks  and coffees. As a member of the National Academy of Science and several of its committees  he guided National Science Foundation and NASA funding for the astrophysics community. He wasappointed to the National Science Boardby President George H.W. Bush and continued to serve under President Barack Obama  and participated on a NASA committee that reviewed the history and future of space travel. At NASA  he was chair of the Toward Other Planetary Systems Science Working Group  and was a member on its Astronomy Missions Board  Physical Sciences Committee  and the Space Science Advisory Committee. He held leadership and editorial positions on many astronomy-focused councils and societies.Princeton Astrophysics Professor Neta A. Bahcall calls him “one of the giants of astrophysics — a pioneering radio astronomer whose research has extended over many topics."The astronomical community lost a star ” says Bahcall  though his work lives on. “His scientific legacy will continue to shine.”He is survived by his wife Elizabeth “Betsy” Platt; his sister Sarah “Sally” Berenson; his daughter  Elizabeth Kahn  and her husband  Cory; two sons  Mark and Matt  and Matt’s wife  Sarah; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild; Betsy’s children Will Balliett  Blue Balliett  and Julie Rose; and her eight grandchildren. He was predeceased by his first wife  Jane Pann Burke  his son Geoffrey  and his sister Clare Molloy. A funeral mass was held Aug. 11 at St. Paul’s in Cambridge.There will be a memorial for Professor Burke at the MIT Chapel on Nov. 10 at 3 p.m.  followed by a reception.In lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to MIT  in memory of Bernard Burke  to support theAlumni Fellowship Fund in Physics #2738023.

George Hatsopoulos  senior lecturer emeritus and MIT Corporation life member emeritus  dies at 91,George Nicholas Hatsopoulos  an MIT mechanical engineering senior lecturer emeritus who founded the Thermo Electron Corporation has passed away at the age of 91. Hatsopoulos '49  SM '50  ME '54  SCD '56 served as a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation. In 1996  he received The John Fritz Medal which is often regarded as the highest honor in engineering.Born in Athens  Greece  in 1927  Hatsopoulos demonstrated his ingenuity at a young age. Inspired by his many relatives who were engineers  he made an image projector using cellophane and light at the age of 6. He spent his early childhood enamored with Thomas Edison’s research and devoted much of his youth to studying Edison’s work.Hatsopoulos was a junior in high school in 1942 when Nazis occupied Greece. His family was forced to house Nazi officers in their home. Undeterred by the risks  Hatsopoulos built radios using parts he found in the junkyard and would listen to broadcasts about the Allied Forces’ efforts — an activity outlawed by the Nazis who lived upstairs.Shortly thereafter  he studied at theNational Technical University of Athens. He then moved to the United States to continue studying at MIT. He received his bachelor’s degree  master of science degree  master of engineering degree  and doctorate of science degree in mechanical engineering at MIT. His doctoral thesis  entitled “The thermo-electron engine”  focused on thermodynamics and informed one of the biggest milestones of his career — the founding of Thermo Electron Corporation.Upon graduating with his doctorate in 1956  Hatsopoulos joined the faculty inMIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. That same year  along with Peter Nomikos  he co-founded the Thermo Electron Corporation.In aMarch 2016 interviewfor the MIT Infinite History Project  Hatsopoulos explained his philosophy when starting Thermo Electron. “My concept of a technology company is … have a group of outstanding people and then look around [and ask] what is an emerging need that society has?” he said. “See if you can find solutions to that and dedicate the company [to it]  not only in any one business  but in the business of creating new businesses. That was my model.”Hatsopoulos applied that philosophy after reading aNew York Timesarticle about heart disease in America. He was inspired to build a team within Thermo Electron devoted to developing the first artificial heart.As CEO and Chairman of Thermo Electron  Hatsopoulos turned the company into a global leader in analytical and monitoring instruments. By the time he retired in 1999  Thermo Electron had over 24 000 employees in 23 countries and worked in industries ranging from medical devices and environmental systems to bomb detectors and biomass electric generation. In 2006  Thermo Electron merged with Fisher Scientific to formThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies.While building Thermo Electron from the ground up  Hatsopoulos remained active within the MIT community. In 1962  he was named senior lecturer  a role he held until 1990. In the same interview with the MIT Infinite History Project  Hatsopoulos recalls a time when he was asked what he did for fun: “I said I teach  that’s my goal. I don’t like golf … but I like teaching  I have fun teaching.”In addition to teaching  Hatsopoulos made major contributions to the field of thermodynamics throughout his career. In 1965  he published the seminal textbook  "Principles of General Thermodynamics " along with "Thermionic Energy Conversion Volume I" and "Thermionic Energy Conversion Volume II" in the 1970s. In 1976  he contributed to a pioneering formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics  which is viewed as a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.Hatsopoulos served on a number of boards including the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  the Governing Council of the National Academy of Engineering  and the National Bureau of Economic Research  just to name a few. He was a fellow of the National Academy of Engineering  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.Throughout his illustrious career in both academia and industry  Hatsopoulos was celebrated with numerous awards. In addition to TheJohn Fritz Medal  he was named a commander of the Order of Honor in Greece and was named inventor of the year by the Boston Museum of Science in 1990.Even after retiring from teaching in 1990  MIT remained an integral part of Hatsopoulos’ life. He was made a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation. His daughter Marina received her master’s degree in mechanical engineering (MechE) at MIT in 1993  the same year she married his former student Walter Bornhorst  who received his PhD in mechanical engineering at MIT. Hatsopoulos’ granddaughter is a current MechE student.
Samuel Bodman  MIT Corporation member and former U.S. Secretary of Energy  dies at 79,Samuel W. Bodman III ScD ’65  a former MIT associate professor and life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation  who served as the U.S. Secretary of Energy and in other cabinet posts  died on Sept. 7 in El Paso  Texas  after a long illness. He was 79.Bodman  who earned his doctoral degree from MIT in chemical engineering  served as Secretary of Energy in the George W. Bush administration from 2005 to 2009  after being unanimously confirmed by the Senate. He had previously served as Deputy Secretary of Treasury and Deputy Secretary of Commerce. Bush said in a prepared statement  “Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Sam Bodman. Sam had a brilliant mind  and we are fortunate that he put his intellect to work for our country as Secretary of Energy. I am proud that he was a member of my cabinet  and I am proud that he was my friend.”“Sam led an extraordinary life of leadership and service in business  academia  and government. MIT was the very fortunate beneficiary of his time  talent  and wisdom in so many different capacities over the years. We are saddened by his loss but grateful for his impact on the Institute and well beyond ” says Robert Millard  chair of the MIT Corporation.Bodman was born in Chicago in 1938 and earned his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from Cornell University in 1961. He then earned his ScD in chemical engineering at MIT in 1965  where he then began a six-year stint as an associate professor. He later became a station director of what is now called the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice  and he served on a landmark commission on the future of MIT education. He became a member of the MIT Corporation  the Institute’s governing body  and served on its Executive and Investment Committees  ultimately becoming a lifetime trustee.He also served on the boards of Cornell University  the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum  the New England Aquarium  and the Carnegie Institution for Science. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.His family recalls that a favorite saying of his was  “Every day is another opportunity to excel ” which he liked to say every morning  according to his stepdaughter Caroline Greene.After leaving MIT  Bodman was technical director of the American Research and Development Corporation  an early venture capital firm  and from there went to Fidelity Venture Associates. He was appointed president and COO of Fidelity Investments in 1983  and also became director of the Fidelity Group of Mutual Funds.In 1987  he moved to the Cabot Corporation to serve as chairman and CEO  where he served until joining the Bush administration in 2001. “His mind is extraordinarily creative and innovative. He has an ability to see things in a very broad and yet comprehensive way ” Kennett F. Burnes  who worked with Bodman at Cabot and succeeded him as the company’s chief executive  toldThe Boston Globeat the time of his appointment to be energy secretary.Though he was born in Chicago and had homes in Florida and Texas as well as Martha’s Vineyard  Bodman remained an avid lifelong fan of the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots  his family says. Even during his eight years in Washington  “he made it very plain that those were his most favorite teams ” says his wife Diane Bodman.Reflecting on his lifelong association with MIT  first as a student  then a professor  and finally a Corporation member  Mrs. Bodman says that “he loved MIT. He thought it was the finest institution in the world of its kind. He felt MIT really changed his life.”Part of that  she says  was that it gave him “an approach to problems which encouraged a fact-based and insightful view of a problem  whether it was a problem in thermodynamics or a practical life problem.”“He was a very intense person — he did everything with intensity ” Greene says. “He was a remarkable force in everything he did  both in his professional and personal life.”Mrs. Bodman adds that “he found humor in most things  most situations. He was always quick to laugh.” Although he enjoyed fly fishing and loved his dogs  “he wasn’t a man who had hobbies. Sam’s favorite activity was work ” she says.One thing he particularly enjoyed  she says  was “mentoring young people ” whether they were younger workers in the Department of Energy or entrepreneurs he worked with in his venture capital endeavors. “He encouraged thoughtful risk-taking ” she says. “He was a motivator.”Mrs. Bodman adds that over the years  many of those young people returned to tell him “my life was changed by you.” They would say that lessons they learned by observing the way he worked or ran meetings were something they “carried over into their professional lives  and things they learned from his leadership style they have tried to use in their own careers.”“He brought out the best in everyone ” Greene adds. “He demanded the best  saw the best  and expected no less from everyone  including himself.”Bodman is survived by his wife M. Diane Bodman; three children  Elizabeth Mott  Andrew Bodman  and Sarah Greenhill; two step-children  Perry Barber and Caroline Greene; and a brother  James Bodman. His first wife  Elizabeth Little Bodman  died in 1982.
John de Monchaux  former dean of the School of Architecture and Planning  dies at 81,Jean Pierre de Monchaux  an idealistic and optimistic planner and architect who served as dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning from 1981 to 1992  passed away on April 30  after living with Parkinson’s disease for 20 years. He was 81.De Monchaux  also known as John  came to MIT after many years’ professional experience in the United States  the United Kingdom  South America  Australia  and Southeast Asia. His international upbringing in Dublin  Montréal  New York City  Bogotá  Sydney  and London produced lasting memories of life onboard the ocean liners and tramp steamers that ferried him between these places as a boy and young man.His diverse background informed his vision of urban planning as a conciliatory practice of listening and learning between constituencies and professionals. He understood all of the world’s cities as neighborhoods of a single global village — as shared places of possibility  and of messy meaning  that transcended false notions of order and border.“John’s legacy is all around us ” says Hashim Sarkis  dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “His influence is reflected every day through our classes and research  in our passion to serve the world  and in the thoughtful  caring  and supportive community that is a hallmark of SA+P.”As dean  de Monchaux was known for his ability to nurture dialogue  to forge consensus  and to build bridges between SA+P and other schools at the Institute. He achieved major milestones in the school’s history  including the completion of the award-winning Rotch Library extension in Building 7  the establishment of the Center for Real Estate (the first program of its kind in the United States)  and the opening — in the newly-designed I.M. Pei building — of the Media Lab  an endeavor that de Monchaux was proud to have named after many wordier and narrower possibilities were considered.After stepping down as dean in 1992  de Monchaux took a four-year partial leave from MIT to serve as general manager of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture  a Geneva-based foundation concerned with architecture and urban design as a catalyst for cultural and social development in the Muslim world.In 1996  he returned to MIT and spent the next dozen years teaching in two departments: Urban Studies and Planning and Architecture. From 1996 until 2004  he served as head of the Special Program in Urban Regional Studies (SPURS)  a one-year program designed for mid-career professionals from developing countries.“He helped many of us  faculty and students alike  to design better cities ” says DUSP department head Eran Ben-Joseph  who worked with de Monchaux in the department. “He was a true friend  mentor  and colleague — a person of genuine integrity  great wisdom  and a gentle soul who will be sorely missed.”De Monchaux was also a dedicated presence in the Boston design community  serving on the boards of the Boston Society of Architects and the Boston Architectural College  and founding the Boston Civic Design Commission as well as serving as its first chair. He was a trustee of the Boston Foundation for Architecture  and a trustee and overseer of the Museum of Fine Arts  Boston.Born in Dublin  Ireland  to a French-Australian family  de Monchaux was educated at St John’s College of the University of Sydney in Australia  and at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design  where later  in 1971  he would become a member of that school’s second class of Loeb Fellows. He began his teaching career at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College  London  in 1964  the beginning of what would become a long collaboration with then-professor Lord Richard Llewellyn-Davies.De Monchaux had been admitted to MIT’s bachelor’s in architecture program in 1954 from Stuyvesant High School in New York City  but was unable to afford the tuition and enroll as a student. He returned to MIT in 1981 with a particular dedication to opening the Institute’s doors ever wider.With his wife  British sociologist Suzanne de Monchaux  as part of the design team  he was principal planner for Milton Keynes  a new city in Buckinghamshire  England  that was conceived in the late 1960s as the crowning achievement of Great Britain’s utopian postwar New Towns Movement. In more than two decades of practice as a planner  primarily with global planning partnership Llewellyn Davies and its successor firms  he played a leading role in advocacy design assistance in Watts  Detroit  and Chicago. He also participated in urban plans and environmental impact studies throughout Australia  China  the Middle East  and Southeast Asia  with a particular interest in the developing world  vernacular typologies  and informal urbanisms.De Monchaux is survived by his twin sons: Nicholas de Monchaux  an associate professor of architecture and urban design at the University of California at Berkeley and a founding partner of the interdisciplinary architecture firm modem; and Thomas de Monchaux  an author  designer  and adjunct assistant professor of architecture at Columbia University.For a story published in 2007 inPLANon the occasion of de Monchaux’s nominal retirement from teaching  Lois Craig  who served as associate dean  recalled  “He had a method of getting agreement from people  forming friendships and professional alliances that supported his policies. He created a sense of functional togetherness. He was a conciliator and an enabler  bringing people together.”In that same article  Professor Julian Beinart  who co-taught many urban design studios with de Monchaux  reflected on his colleague’s studio technique: “John always took the epistemologically cool position: Let’s think about your proposition  let’s untie the knots of your argument  to the extent we can  let’s see if we can reframe some of the parts  let’s see where that takes us.”A memorial service will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday  Sept. 29  in the MIT Chapel.
Shih-Ying Lee  longtime mechanical engineering professor  inventor  and entrepreneur  dies at 100,Shih-Ying Lee  a longtime MIT mechanical engineering professor and expert in process control  measurement  and instrumentation  passed away peacefully on July 2 in Lincoln  Massachusetts. Lee '43  SCD '45 had recently celebrated his 100th birthday in April.Lee’s career spanned over six decades and included positions in both academia and industry. In 2015  he provided an overview of his professional and personal achievements in his autobiography entitled  “From Tsinghua to MIT — My Journey from Education to Entrepreneurship.”Born in Beijing (known at the time as Beiping)  China  on April 30  1918  Lee was drawn to engineering at an early age. He received a bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University in the midst of World War II and the Second Sino-Japanese War. Upon graduating  Lee worked as a bridge designer and hydraulic power research engineer for the Chinese government.Eager to continue his education in the United States  Lee made a harrowing journey halfway around the world in the midst of global conflict. He flew first to India  then took a ship to the U.S. via South America. In 1942 he enrolled at MIT  where he received master's and doctor of science degrees in civil engineering.After a two-year stint at Cram and Ferguson Architects  Lee returned to MIT as a research engineer in the Dynamic Analysis and Control Lab. He joined the faculty in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1952. Throughout his tenure as a professor  Lee made extensive improvements to several courses including 2.171 (at the time  Fluid Power Control) and 2.173 (Measurement and Control).Lee’s interest in measurement and instrumentation extended beyond the classrooms of MIT. He shared an entrepreneurial spirit and interest in startups with his brother  MIT professor of aeronautics Yao-Tzu Li SM '38  SCD '39. In 1953  they co-founded Dynisco Inc.  which manufactured pressure-measuring instruments. To focus on his work at MIT  Lee sold Dynisco to the American Brake Shoe Company in 1960.Less than a decade later  the brothers formed Setra Systems Inc.  which specialized in instruments for sensing and measuring. The company designed and manufactured devices such as accelerometers  pressure transducers  and laboratory balances. These instruments  and all other products produced by Setra  had variable capacitance sensors  an application co-developed by Lee and his brother.In 1974  Lee retired after 22 years on the mechanical engineering faculty at MIT. For the next three decades  much of his professional focus was on Setra Systems  where he served as chair and chief executive officer in the 1990s. Many of his patents involved pressure and force sensing products developed at Setra.Throughout his career  Lee received a number of prestigious awards in recognition of his many contributions to the fields of process control  instrumentation  and sensing. In 1981 he received the Rufus Oldenburger Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his permanent contribution to the field of automatic control. Several years later  he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for “original research on control valve stability  for innovative dynamic measurement instrumentation  and for successful entrepreneurial commercialization of his inventions.” He also received the Technical Excellence Award from the International Society of Weighing and Measurement for his introduction of a new force and weight sensing method.Lee was married to his first wife  May Kao Lee  for 22 years until her death. He was married to his second wife  Lena Yin Lee for 45 years until her death in May 2018. In 1991  Lee and Lena established the Shih-Ying (1943) & Lena Y. Lee Endowed Fellowship Fund in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The scholarship was most recently awarded to a graduate student in 2016.Later in his life  Lee enjoyed keeping up with the latest personal computing devices  staying fit with his daily walks and exercises  connecting with his children and grandchildren  and playing Scrabble with his wife at their home in Lincoln. He is survived by their four children: Carol Lee; David Lee ME '73  PhD ’80; Linda Lee PhD '85; and Eileen Brooks.
Alan Hanson  who led the International Nuclear Leadership Education Program  dies at 71,Alan S. Hanson PhD '77  who served as executive director of International Nuclear Leadership Education Program within the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) until June 2015  died on Aug. 4 from metastatic cancer at the age of 71.Hanson was born in Chicago  Illinois  on Dec. 27  1946. He received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1969 from Stanford University  and a PhD in nuclear engineering in 1977 from MIT. His passion for discovery and learning led him back to school to earn a master's degree in liberal studies at Georgetown University in 2009.Before returning to MIT in 2012  Hanson served for more than 30 years in increasingly senior executive positions in the nuclear industry  accumulating broad managerial  international  and engineering experience  most of which was devoted to the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle  nuclear waste management  and issues of non-proliferationHanson joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna  Austria in 1979  where he served first as coordinator of the International Spent Fuel Management Program and later as policy analyst with responsibilities in the areas of safeguards and non-proliferation policies.Upon returning to the U.S.  Hanson served as president and CEO of Transnuclear  Inc. In 2005 he was appointed as executive vice president of technologies and used fuel management at AREVA NC Inc. In this position he was responsible for all of AREVA’s activities in the backend of the nuclear fuel cycle in the U.S.He completed a year-long assignment as a visiting scholar at the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) at Stanford University on loan from AREVA in 2011. At CISAC he conducted research on the worldwide nuclear supply chain and international fuel assurance mechanisms.In 2012 Hanson returned to MIT as the executive director of NSE’s International Nuclear Leadership Education Program (INLEP). INLEP  an intensive executive education course designed for nuclear leaders from countries new to nuclear power  was the only program of its kind in the world.Hanson proved to be an outstanding leader of INLEP. Professor Richard Lester  then head of NSE  recalled him as "a man of great ability and great integrity." Added Lester  "Alan listened carefully before he spoke  but he never hesitated to say what he thought. We could always be sure that he would put the interests of the department and MIT first  and during his service as INLEP executive director I relied on him implicitly for his wisdom  judgment  commitment and dedication."Hanson’s love for the outdoors took him on hiking trips on the Appalachian Trail  Acadia National Park  and through Austria and Ireland. Over the last few years he helped clear trails with the Lewisboro Land Trust. Jazz  classical music  and reading were also amongst Hanson’s joys.Loved by all who knew him  Hanson is remembered as a kind  brilliant man  devoted to family  friends  and colleagues alike. He is survived by his wife of 34 years  Bairbre; his daughter Alanna Reed and son-in-law Tim Reed; son Colin Hanson; his two grandchildren  Madeline and Molly Reed; his sister Shelley Ruth; and nephew Jason.A celebration of his life will be held on Sept. 8 in Croton Falls  New York.
For Kofi Annan  shared prosperity meant shared responsibility,As technology  trade  and globalization tie the world’s cultures and communities ever closer together  the responsibility of each to guarantee and protect the well-being of the others grows in step — and that goes for nations and corporations alike.That was the message thatKofi Annan SM ’72  the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations from 1996 to 2007  had for members of the MIT Sloan community in October of 2002  when he spoke to mark the 50th anniversary of his alma mater.Annan  the first black African to hold the top U.N. post died Saturday at the age of 80from a short and unspecified illness.In the talk  Annan said his time as an MIT Sloan Fellow during the early part of his career  which he spent almost entirely with the U.N.  broadened his perspective on how to achieve international change and cooperation.“Sloan looked well beyond the confines of this campus  encouraged people from many nations to study here  and was eager to advance the cause of international cooperation  scholarly and otherwise ” Annan said.That education would come in handy later on  he noted  as he helped the U.N. navigate some of its most challenging moments and found himself negotiating across from many of the world’s most powerful leaders.Halfway through his tenure as secretary-general  Annan and the U.N. were jointly awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for their work to create a “better organized and more peaceful world ” containing the spread of HIV in Africa and working to oppose international terrorism.But Annan also faced his fair share of challenging diplomatic situations. As the U.N.’s chief of peacekeeping  heoversaw the response to the Rwandan genocideof the mid-1990s  and later worked feverishly in an attempt to dissuade the United States from launching its 2003 invasion of Iraq. He told Time magazine in 2013 that his failure to prevent that action was “his darkest moment.”Even after he left the U.N.  he returned in various capacities  being tapped in 2012 to help find a resolution for the still-raging civil war in Syria. He also launched theKofi Annan Foundation  a nonprofit that works to promote better global governance and world peace.The challenges facing the world are much the same now as they were in 2002 — cultural distrust leading to violence  uncertainty in the markets raising global anxiety  and concerns that globalization is enriching a select few at the expense of the many. But Annan’s emphasis on shared responsibility led to the formation of partnerships between the U.N.  major corporations  and the world’s governments designed to ensure sustainable progress for all during his tenure.Annan  in the MIT Sloan speech  emphasized the importance of trust and understanding among the world’s governing institutions and highlighted the crucial role of global business in helping to solve those problems.“Businesses may ask why they should go down this path  especially if it involves taking steps that competitors might not  or steps they feel are rightly the province of governments ” he said. “Sometimes  doing what is right … is in the immediate interest of business.”Corporations  he said  should see it as their responsibility to use their resources to pass knowledge  technology  and training along to the communities in which they operate.When German car manufacturer Volkswagen found that it was losing some of its best managers to HIV/AIDS in Brazil  Annan described  the company implemented an education and treatment program  which saw the employees survive to pass the same information on to their communities.He continued: “Sometimes we must do what is right simply because not to do so would be wrong. And sometimes  we do what is right to help usher in a new day  of new norms and new behaviors. We do not want business to do anything different from their normal business; we want them to do their normal business differently.”Absent that effort  he said  the world risks rejecting global citizenship and retreating into protectionism and isolation  to the detriment of all.“All of us — the private sector  civil society  labor unions  NGOs  universities  foundations  and individuals — must come together in an alliance for progress ” Annan said. “Together  we can and must move from value to values  from shareholders to stakeholders  and from balance sheets to balanced development. Together  we can and must face the dangers ahead and bring solutions within reach.”
Irving London  founding director of Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology  dies at 99,Irving M. London  founding director of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology (HST) and an expert in the molecular regulation of hemoglobin synthesis  died on May 23 at age 99.The HST community had recently celebrated London’s life and accomplishments on the occasion of his approaching 100 birthday. London expressed great pleasure in the festivities  held on May 7.London was born in Malden  Massachusetts  on July 24  1918. He graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor of arts degree  summa cum laude  in 1939; he simultaneously earned a second bachelor’s degree from the Hebrew College in Roxbury  Massachusetts. London weighed attending law school versus medical school after graduation  eventually accepting an offer from Harvard Medical School (HMS). His tenure at HMS instilled in him a love of research that spanned the rest of his career.After graduation  London accepted an internship at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. His training was interrupted by World War II  where he served as a captain in the Medical Corps. He was also part of a research effort that showed the efficacy of chloroquine as an anti-malarial drug. At the end of his military service  he was assigned to Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific to serve as the physician for the Congressional delegation to the atom bomb tests.London returned to New York to resume his residency after the war. Following residency  he took up a research fellowship in the Department of Biochemistry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He soon joined the faculty and embarked on a rich research  teaching  and clinical tenure at Columbia. In 1954  London became the founding chair of the Department of Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He served as professor and chair of the department  and directed medical services at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center until 1970.In 1968 London was invited to serve as a consultant to MIT and Harvard Medical School to assist in the planning of a new program joining the two institutions. He then devoted a sabbatical year to carrying out the initial program development  including garnering the support of the faculties of both MIT and HMS. In 1970  he accepted the directorship of this new entity  the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. HST represents London’s commitment to the integration of medical education and university education  and integration of interdisciplinary biomedical research  education and medical practice. London  who was professor of medicine at HMS and professor of biology at MIT  served as the director of HST until 1985.London received numerous awards and honors over the years for his groundbreaking work explaining the molecular regulation of hemoglobin synthesis at the level of gene transcription and translation into protein. The honors include: a Welch Fellowship in Internal Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences from 1949-1952  the Theobald Smith Award in Medical Sciences of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1953  the Commonwealth Fund Fellowship at Institut Pasteur from 1962-1963  election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963  charter membership in the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in 1970  and elected membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1971. From 1982 to 2003  he served first on the board of directors and then on the Biosciences Advisory Committee of the pharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson.Looking back over his career  London derived great satisfaction from having played a key role in the founding of three institutions known for their contributions to medical research  practice  and education: Albert Einstein College of Medicine  the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences  and HST. His passion for HST never abated. As late as fall 2017  he continued to teach and co-direct HST.140 (Molecular Medicine)  a course that he developed with Paul Gallop in 1979. London was present for most of HST’s major events  including the HST Forum  HST dinner seminars  and HST graduation. There he shared his intellect  wit  and warmth with the students  faculty  alumni  and staff of HST.London was preceded in death by his wife  Huguette. He is survived by his sons  Robb and David  as well as Robb’s children Jacob and Danielle.London was looking forward to HST’s 50th anniversary in 2020. His pioneering work in creating a unique physician/scientist/engineer training program is his enduring legacy  and positions HST well for the next 50 years.
Professor Emeritus Leon Trilling dies at 93,Leon Trilling  a professor emeritus in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Program in Science  Technology  and Society  and co-founder of the Massachusetts Department of Education's statewideMETCO Program  passed away on April 20. He was 93.Trilling was born in Bialystok  Poland  on July 15  1924  the son of Oswald and Regina (Zakhejm) Trilling. The family fled to France in the 1930s  and in 1940  Trilling came to the United States and enrolled as an undergraduate at Caltech. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1946.Trilling received a BS in mechanical engineering in 1944  a master of science in 1946  and a PhD in aeronautics in 1948  all from Caltech. He was also for a time a Caltech research fellow and instructor. After a year in Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship  he began his MIT career in 1951 as a research associate in the Department of Aeronautical Engineering  which eight years later was renamed the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro). Trilling spent 1963 studying gas dynamics at the University of Paris on a Guggenheim Fellowship.At MIT  Trilling focused his research on the development of jet aircraft; the history of engineering  technology  and science; and the role of the science and mathematics curricula in middle schools. In 1978  in addition to his position in AeroAstro  he joined the faculty of the Program in Science  Technology  and Society  based in the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences  where his teaching centered on the history of engineering  technology  and science — in particular  the relationship between technology and the military.Trilling’s community involvement began in 1965. He and his family had settled in Brookline  Massachusetts  where he served as president of the Brookline School Committee. He was well aware of the lack of diversity in the classroom. He believed that equal economic and cultural opportunity begins with equal educational opportunity  and he helped to design a program that would expand public school students’ educational opportunities  increase diversity  and reduce racial isolation by allowing individuals to attend schools in communities other than their own.Concerned Brookline residents including Governor Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty worked closely with Trilling to transform his idea into reality. “This was a time when people of color could not live in the town of Brookline ” Dukakis recalls. “Leon was deeply involved. He was active at a time when some of these ridiculous prejudices and biases were beginning to crumble. He had a very strong set of values  and we greatly admired what he did.”In 1966  Trilling’s vision of educational equality becameMETCO. The program has expanded beyond Brookline  and today  as administered by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education  is the second-oldest voluntary program in the country dedicated to increasing diversity in schools.Trilling's leadership helped bridge cultural and racial differences and increase diversity on the MIT campus as well. He founded MIT’s Integrated Studies Program; played pivotal roles in the Office of Minority Education  the MIT Second Summer Program  and the Course XVI Outreach Committee; served as academic advisor to theMITESprogram; and co-directed the New Liberal Arts program. He was a senior staff member of The Institute for Learning and Teaching and was passionate about introducing minority students to science and engineering.Professor Emeritus Louis Bucciarelli ’66  was a student of Trilling’s in the early 1960s while studying for his PhD in aeronautics and astronautics  and later  he became Trilling’s colleague in the department. “Throughout my years on the faculties of the School of Engineering and the program in STS  Leon was a natural ally in working to broaden undergraduate education ” says Bucciarelli. “He was always available to hear me out  to read and critique my proposals and essays. He was a mentor who showed how  with clear thinking  persistence and drive  it was possible to bridge the cultures of engineering and the humanities at MIT.”In 1972  Trilling invited Wesley Harris  now the C. S. Draper Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics  to join the MIT faculty. “He served as my mentor  my guide  and my counselor ” says Harris. “He provided a philosophical basis that allowed me as an African American to flourish in a sharply racist environment. He had a sense of humanity that he exercised in such a way that everything he touched became better.”In a 2002 interview with Clarence G. Williams  founder of MIT’s Black History Project  Trilling explained  “The essence is to create an atmosphere which is encouraging to young people of a minority background who would consider the possibility of careers in the field  to keep them interested  to keep them confident that they can do the job  and to show them that there are role models for them at MIT to be sure  and elsewhere  also.”Merritt Roe Smith  the Cutten Professor of the History of Technology in the STS program  remembers Trilling as one of the first professors he met when he came to MIT in 1978. “I remember him as a true gentleman scholar  whose European background and education made him a special type of intellectual who deeply appreciated the humanistic and social science dimensions of engineering ” he says.“We ended up teaching a course together on the role of the military as a catalyst of technological change. It was in that class that I came to appreciate his technical expertise and how he deftly combined it with a wide-ranging knowledge of the history of science and technology. He was a genuinely good person who cared a lot about students of all ages. I will miss him. His was a special presence among us.”After his retirement in 1994  Trilling continued teaching at MIT for another 23 years. As recently as 2016  Trillingtook public transportation to Kendall Square in Cambridge each dayand climbed the steep stairway to the MIT campus. In avideoproduced that year by Jonathan Sachs for Boston’s Commission on Affairs of the Elderly  Trilling revealed his secret to longevity. “Keep busy ” he said. “Get yourself emotionally involved  and feel that you’re doing something useful.”Trilling explained the motivation for his work in justice and civil rights in his interview with Williams. “It comes from having come as a Polish Jew to the United States in 1940 and having been welcomed for what I was  given every opportunity and being … profoundly inspired by this hospitality ” he said. “In fact  this is what the United States means to me most  that it is an open society which believes in and tries to promote equality of opportunity.”In 1996  Trilling received MIT’s Martin Luther King Leadership Award in recognition of his “deep and enduring commitment to improving the quality of education for people of color.”Harris describes Trilling as “a true renaissance man  a learned scholar  a highly cultured individual  and extremely well read.” Generations of students will remember him for his insights and inspiration  his soft-spoken manner  and his signature red neckties.Trilling was preceded in death by his wife  Edna. He is survived by two sons  Roger and Alex  and one daughter-in-law  Marlene.The Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics will sponsor a memorial service for Trilling on Thursday  May 31 at 4 p.m. in the MIT Chapel.

P.L. Thibaut Brian  professor emeritus of chemical engineering  dies at 87,Pierre Leonc Thibaut Brian  professor emeritus in the Department of Chemical Engineering  died on April 2 at age 87.Born in New Orleans  Louisiana  on July 8  1930  Brian received a BS in chemical engineering from Louisiana State University in 1951. He earned his ScD in chemical engineering from MIT in 1956  supervised by Professor Edwin R. Gilliland. Upon graduation  he immediately joined the faculty of the Department of Chemical Engineering as director of the Bangor Station of the Chemical Engineering Practice School. As a professor  Brian’s research focused largely on mass and heat transfer with simultaneous chemical reaction. He was an early adopter of computers in chemical engineering and contributed to the associated opportunities in process control and numerical analysis.“Thibaut was well known for many qualities but two may head the list: high energy and quickness of insight. He projected enormous energy and worked extremely hard — and this made him a captivating teacher ” says Ken Smith  the Gilliland Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering. “When Thibaut was presented with a complex  ill-defined problem  he would almost instantly understand what the essential elements really were and how one should go about attacking it.”In 1972  Brian retired from MIT and joined Air Projects as vice president of engineering  where he remained until 1994. Brian’s early contributions at Air Products were mainly of a technical sort  largely in the context of air separation. Later  he became a very effective advocate for enhanced safety in the chemical process industry and particularly for sophisticated quantitative hazard analyses as a means of assessing risks. As a result of his efforts  Air Products’ safety record became one of the best in the industry and other companies emulated their procedures.Brian was an active member and director of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers; he received its Professional Progress in Chemical Engineering Award in 1973 and its R.L. Jacks Award (now re-named the Management Award) in 1989. Churchill College of Cambridge in the United Kingdom elected him to the position of Overseas Fellow  and hosted him for a sabbatical year. Brian was a member of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology and the American Industrial Health Council. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1975 for his “contributions to both theory and engineering practice of desalination  mass transfer in chemically reactive systems  and the technology of liquefied gases.” Brian was elected to foreign membership in the Royal Academy of Engineering (UK) in 1991. In 1972  he authored the book  “Staged Cascades in Chemical Processing.”Predeceased in 2016 by his wife of 64 years  Geraldine 'Gerry ' he is survived by his son Richard and daughter-in-law Susan; his son James and daughter-in-law Sheryl; his daughter  Evelyn 'Evie'; his grandchildren  Richard Christopher Brian and Lauren Brian Spears; and by his great grandson  Olin Thomas Spears.

Professor Joseph Sussman  expert in complex engineering systems and revered mentor  dies at 79,Retired MIT Professor Joseph Sussman passed away on Tuesday  March 20  at the age of 79 following a long illness. An MIT alumnus and professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data  Systems  and Society (IDSS)  Sussman is fondly remembered for his dedication to his students and to the MIT community.Sussman received a bachelor’s in civil engineering from City College of New York in 1961  a master's of civil engineering from the University of New Hampshire in 1963  and his PhD from MIT in 1967. Shortly after completing his doctoral program  Sussman became a professor in CEE.Sussman was a professor for over 50 years and served as department head in CEE from 1980 to 1985. In 1991 he was awarded the inaugural JR East Professorship  an endowed chair that spurred the establishment of a long-standing partnership between the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and MIT. He was awarded the CEE Distinguished Service and Leadership Award in 2017 for his devotion to encouraging a culture of diversity  inclusiveness  and innovation and for embodying the department mission and vision of MIT. At the ceremony  Sussman was honored for his friendship and mentorship to both students and fellow faculty members and for his support of all CEE community events.“Joe was a special person and colleague. He never hesitated to lend a hand  offer advice  and support students and colleagues ” says Markus Buehler  the McAfee Professor of Engineering and head of CEE. “I vividly remember when I first met Joe during my interview  and later for coffee shortly after I joined the faculty at MIT. His passion for mentoring and teaching  and focus on students  was evident in everything he did during his long tenure at MIT. We will all miss him dearly and are deeply grateful for the time we could spend with him  and what he has taught us.”“I first met Joe on Engineering Council when he was serving as an interim director of [the Engineering Systems Division]. He introduced himself jokingly as being part of a recycling program at MIT; given that he was a department head almost 30 years before. Since that day  I really enjoyed our interactions ” recalls Munther Dahleh  director of IDSS and the William A. Coolidge Professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Joe was always collegial irrespective of the context. I got to know him well during the launch period of IDSS. He always took the time to give thoughtful and constructive comments and was always supportive of the outcomes. He cared a lot about students and their experiences at MIT and emphasized that during the formation of IDSS. We developed a friendship in the last few years that I will always cherish. It is people like Joe that make MIT a special place. I will miss him dearly.”Sussman taught and mentored many undergraduate students and advised over 120 master's theses and over 20 doctoral dissertations during his tenure  and maintained relationships with a number of his former students. He led the Regional Transportation Planning and High-Speed Rail Research Group (R/HSR)  a close-knit community of scholars who frequently held get-togethers and convened for reunions at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board.Sussman took great pride in mentoring students and spoke affectionately of his relationships with his students and research group members  a sentiment reciprocated by those who worked with him. Many of his former students and mentees laud his leadership and dedication to both their research and to their personal development.“Joe’s research accomplishments were numerous and extraordinary  but he has so many other lasting legacies ” says Joanna Moody  a graduate student in R/HSR and mentee of Sussman. “I think that one of the most often mentioned — and for me very personally important — was how much he connected with his students. He cared as much about how your personal life was progressing as he did your research.”Sussman’s research focus was on large scale complex engineering systems  which he applied to freight rail  intelligent transportation systems  and market selection processes.As a graduate student at MIT  Sussman worked on the application of computing to engineering processes  a project called Integrated Civil Engineering Systems (ICES). He later worked on intelligent transportation systems (ITS)  the use of advanced technology to make transportation networks operate efficiently. Sussman was a member of a small group who developed the first national strategic plan for ITS in the United States. In 2015  Sussman wasinductedinto the Intelligent Transportation Society of America Hall of Fame.In recent years  Sussman led the development of complex  large-scale  integrated  open  sociotechnical (CLIOS) systems and the CLIOS Process  a theoretical framework that can be applied to complex systems. Sussman and members of his group applied the CLIOS Process to complex systems including ITS  wind energy (Cape Wind)  air defense  and the introduction of broadband access in Kenya.“I was privileged to work with Joe Sussman for over 50 years ” says Daniel Roos  professor emeritus of engineering systems and CEE and longtime friend of Sussman. “He had an unmatched dedication and commitment to MIT and his students  winning three teaching awards in CEE  the Technology and Policy Program  and the Engineering Systems Division.”Sussman also led the first 25 years of the JR East-MIT partnership  resulting in a number of joint research projects. Over the years Sussman collaborated with professionals at JR East  staff members from the company came to study at MIT  and MIT students interned with JR East in Japan. At the 25th anniversary of the program  Sussman noted that “the greatest honor in my professional career has been to serve as the first JR East Professor.”“Joe was a wonderful human being  a great and caring mentor to his students  and a wonderful colleague. He will be truly missed ” says Ali Jadbabaie  a professor of CEE  associate director of IDSS  and the second recipient of the JR East Professorship.A memorial service at MIT will be held in the near future. In lieu of flowers  the Sussman family requests that donations are made to the Joseph and Henri-Ann Book Fund at theLincoln Public Library.
Institute Professor Emeritus Morris Halle  innovative and influential linguist  dies at 94,Institute Professor Emeritus Morris Halle  one of the most accomplished and influential scholars in the field of linguistics  died of natural causes on Monday at age 94.Halle was an expert in phonology  the structure of sounds in language. His wide-ranging work helped establish his own field as an important domain of research and helped systematize inquiry into the subject. Halle’s work was part of a revolution in linguistics that helped scholars understand human language as a phenomenon with a deep and universal structure  which stemmed from distinctive human faculties.Beyond his own research  Halle helped found MIT’s renowned linguistics program and helped imbue it with its intellectual ethos  by encouraging meticulous research  a fruitful combination of empirical work and theory  and a spirit of collaborative  open-ended inquiry  which Halle exemplified throughout his own academic life.Halle and Institute Professor Emeritus Noam Chomsky developed groundbreaking research together in the 1950s and 1960s — after Halle played a key role in bringing Chomsky to MIT in 1955. Together  Chomsky and Halle worked to specify the innate foundations dictating the structure of human language  extending Chomsky’s work on syntax into a rule-governed framework describing the sounds produced in English.“Morris and I were very close for almost 70 years  working together  sharing much else ” Chomsky toldMIT Newsin response to Halle’s death. “His contributions to modern linguistic science are incalculable  not least right here at MIT  where even apart from his groundbreaking work  he was primarily responsible for creating what quickly became  and has remained  the center of a research enterprise that has flourished all over the world  far beyond anything in the millennia of inquiry into language. [Halle was] a wise and compassionate person  more than anyone I’ve known  whose kindness  warmth  and care touched many lives.”David Pesetsky  the head of the MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy  said Halle was a profoundly influential researcher and educator — and a touchstone for MIT linguists over his whole career.“Morris was an epoch-defining figure in the history of modern linguistics — not only for his scientific contributions  which helped launch the modern era of our field  but also for his revolutionary approach to graduate education ” said Pesetsky  the Ferrari P. Ward Professor of Modern Languages and Linguistics.Pesetsky added: “Here at MIT  Morris created a linguistics program unlike any other at the time  which involved students in the process of discovery from the very beginning  took their ideas and findings seriously  and demanded no less from the students themselves. This vision  a very MIT vision  is now everywhere in linguistics  but it was Morris's vision. But Morris was more than just the visionary father of our program and a model scientist. He was also the soul of our program  whom we loved and turned to for direction and advice as students and for years thereafter.”Donca Steriade  the Class of 1941 Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT  and a former PhD student of Halle  heralded his commitment to teaching and the confidence he instilled in his students.“What his former students remember more than Morris’ advice and ideas — wise and abundant as these were — is that he treated us as individually responsible for the future of our field ” Steriade said. “It really concentrates the mind to understand this  within weeks of landing at MIT. He saw his job as that of equipping us with a bit of background knowledge and making us appreciate some of the unsolved problems. The hope was that we would decide to solve them  and acquire an education in the process.”Creating a department  making a revolutionMorris Halle was born in Latvia in 1923  in a Jewish family. His father  a businessman  moved his branch of the family to the United States in 1940  after Germany invaded Poland. However  other relatives of Halle did not emigrate  and only a small portion of Latvia’s Jewish population survived the Nazi occupation.Halle first studied at the City College of New York  before entering the U.S. military and serving in France during World War II. Halle later downplayed his military efforts — “I just did what they told me ”he said toMIT Newsin 2010 — and returned to the U.S. to resume his education. After receiving a master’s degree in linguistics from the University of Chicago and then studying at Columbia University  Halle received his PhD in linguistics from Harvard under an eminent scholar  Roman Jakobson.Among many other skills  Halle was a polyglot whose unusual fluency in languages extended to English  German  French  Russian  Latvian  Yiddish  and Hebrew. That facility helped Halle in 1951 earn a job at MIT teaching German and Russian  as the Institute did not have a formal department devoted to research and teaching in linguistics.But Halle had an expansive vision for linguistics at MIT. He saw the possibilities for a full-fledged research department  one that could pursue work on innovative ideas. That vision started becoming a reality after Halle  who was conducting acoustic research of Russian at MIT’s Research Laboratory for Electronics (RLE)  hired the scholar Carol Chomsky  who would later become a linguist at Harvard. As a result  Halle got to know her husband  Noam Chomsky.In their first conversation  as Noam Chomsky recounted toMIT Newsin 2012  Halle and Chomsky “immediately had a big argument about something  and later I thought he had some good points.” Chomsky added: “Anyway  we very quickly became close friends.” Halle  Chomsky  and biologist Eric Lenneberg soon began an extended dialogue about their novel approach to linguistic explanation  and ultimately Chomsky joined the MIT faculty.“In the summer of 1955  Chomsky  with whom I was friends  needed a job ” Halle toldMIT News. “So I went to the department head and I said  ‘Why don’t we hire Chomsky?’”It was a sound recommendation. Chomsky helped change linguistics with his concept of universal grammar  which holds that language is not simply acquired through social learning  but relies on an innate faculty — which in turn implies that all languages have common structures. Chomsky worked primarily on syntax  the principles underlying the organization of language  but Chomsky and Halle collaborated extensively to extend these concepts to phonology.One result of the Chomsky-Halle partnership was their seminal 1968 book  “The Sound Pattern of English” — often simply called “SPE” — which systematically set out the rules that convert strings of abstract minimal units (known as phonemes) into uttered sounds  in English. According to this hypothesis  the path from mind to speech runs through a set of ordered rules  each one transforming its input in a specified way.In the half-century since SPE appeared  alternate hypotheses have emerged to account for the formation of sounds in English. But the book has had immense influence  pushing the field forward by developing such a broad explanatory framework.Halle’s work extended well beyond the general hypothesis presented in SPE. Among other things  Halle also conducted far-ranging research into the sound patterns of Russian. And in the 1990s  Halle also spent years developing another broad theoretical framework connecting syntax and sound  termed “distributed morphology ” which he created along with linguist Alec Marantz  among other contributors. This refinement outlined a set of operations through which morphemes  the smallest units of sound  are mobilized in the process of speech.“Argue with me!”Among Halle’s many characteristics as a scholar  one of the most enduring was his absolute belief that intellectual research and debate should occur on the basis of substantive insight  without regard to the formal academic hierarchy. Generations of students heard Halle utter a familiar phrase — “Argue with me!” — that served as an invitation for reasoned  empirical discussion.That form of mentorship was powerful  and it sought to produce intellectual progress rather than rigid disciples. In the 2016 edition of theAnnual Review of Linguistics  Mark Liberman  a professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania  wrote that Halle  apart from his vast output of research  “has had an equally profound influence through his role as a teacher and mentor  and this personal influence has not been limited to students who follow closely in his intellectual and methodological footsteps. It has been just as strong — or stronger — among researchers who disagree with his specific ideas and even his general approach  or who work in entirely different subfields.”In a 1974 lecture that Halle made before the members of the Linguistic Society of America  he characteristically declared that “the linguist must be prepared to lose as well as to win.” Asked about that declaration in 2010  Halle instantly quipped  “I was younger then.” However  he quickly added  “If you believe something  put your money where your mouth is  and 10 years later you will know if you were right or wrong. Nobody else will need to tell you when you’re whipped.”Halle’s graduate students  by many accounts (including a large number compiled by Liberman in that same article) often found him daunting and exacting at first  but came to realize how invested Halle was in them  and how supportive he was as their work progressed.“Soon after Morris founded MIT’s linguistics department ” Steriade said  “significant contributions to this research program were made by Morris’ and Noam’s students and colleagues  and then by their own hundreds of students and students’ students. Most phonologists active today trace their academic lineage  directly or indirectly  to Morris.”Just last week  Steriade said  Halle told two former students  “We did some good teaching.”Samuel Jay Keyser  an emeritus professor of linguistics who knew Halle for decades  on Monday paid tribute to Halle’s influential collaboration with Chomsky and his lifetime of good works on behalf of others.“It is impossible to think of Morris Halle without thinking of Noam Chomsky ” Keyser observed. “These two individuals were the pillars upon which theoretical linguistics in the 20th century and beyond was built. They are responsible not only for the best linguistics department in the world  but for sending hundreds of students out into the world to try to do the same.”Keyser recalled telling students that “Morris should be their role model. He is not superhuman  but he is as good as a human being can be. … He was my mentor  my role model  and my friend for over 50 years. Now  sad to say  one of the pillars has crumbled. It had to come. But that doesn’t make it any easier.”For his part  Pesetsky summarized the centrality of Halle to MIT’s linguistics program  and the degree of respect his colleagues held for him  by reflecting on a large50th anniversary celebrationthe linguistics department held in 2011  with multiple days of talks and events.“When our program celebrated its 50th year in 2011  we had Morris's friend and lifelong co-conspirator Noam Chomsky as the final speaker on the second-to-last day of our celebration  but the final slot on the final day belonged to Morris ” Pesetsky said. “None of the several hundred alumni and colleagues in the room needed to be told why  and no other ending was ever discussed.”Halle was married for 56 years to his wife Rosamond  who died in 2011. Halle is survived by his sons  David  John  and Tim  and his grandchildren  Casey  Ben  Cecilia  and Rosie. An MIT service honoring Halleis plannedfor Saturday  May 5.
Donald Rosenfield  a longtime leader of MIT Leaders for Global Operations  dies at 70,Donald Rosenfield  the longtime director of MIT’sLeaders for Global Operations programand a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management  died Jan. 14 following an accident. He was 70.A 1971 graduate of MIT  Rosenfield spent the first 15 years of his career as a consultant and teacher. He worked at MIT as a lecturer and a visiting associate professor for much of the 1980s. In 1987  he returned to the Institute for good to help lead a new degree program then known as MIT Leaders for Manufacturing.“MIT’s bold plan for the future: school joins with business to help end US’ manufacturing decline ” readTheBoston Globeheadline on June 19  1988  when the program was announced. With $46 million and 20 students  Leaders for Manufacturing placed students with corporate partners — including Polaroid  Boeing  and Johnson & Johnson — for six months of hands-on coursework. Then  as today  it was a two-year  dual-degree program. Students earned an MBA from MIT Sloan and a master’s degree from the MIT School of Engineering.At the time  28 percent of MIT Sloan students went to work in manufacturing after graduation  while 41 percent entered the finance field  according to theBostonGlobearticle. Leaders at MIT worried the United States faced a dearth of managers with a technical education.“It is perhaps the first time that such a genuine university and industry collaboration has been created  but also such a strong collaboration between schools at MIT: the school of engineering and Sloan ” said MIT Sloan’s Georgia Perakis  now the William F. Pounds Professor of Management who was a faculty co-director of the dual-degree program from 2009 until 2015.With Rosenfield’s guidance  the program grew and saw its graduates take leadership positions in some of the largest corporations in the United States. Perakis said more than 60 graduates have held upper management positions at Boeing  and she called that a conservative estimate. In 2009  the program was renamed “MIT Leaders for Global Operations” to reflect a broadened approach that looked beyond manufacturing to a company’s entire supply chain.Institute Professor Thomas Magnanti  who was a founding faculty co-director of Leaders for Manufacturing and a former dean of the School of Engineering  said Rosenfield had a role in every aspect of the program’s development from its inception through his retirement. This included strategy  finance  building relationships with partner companies  developing the curriculum  and working with students. Magnanti said Rosenfield was a “pioneer” of the program  along with himself and then-engineering professor Kent Bowen.“He was the key player in mentoring and advising the alumni and the students in the program in a wide variety of ways ” Magnanti said. “He became a dear friend to almost all the students who came through the program.”Jeff Wilke  LGO ’93  CEO of Amazon’s Worldwide Consumer business  called Rosenfield “the plant manager of the LGO/LFM family ” and “uncommonly kind  intensely intelligent  wryly observant  and one of the best friends a person could hope for.”“Don helped to teach me a very valuable playbook for optimizing operations ” Wilke said in an email. “We used the playbook relentlessly as we built Amazon’s processes. Many other alumni have told me of similar experiences. Don leaves an incredible legacy across hundreds of organizations.”David Hardt  the Ralph E. and Eloise F. Cross Professor in Manufacturing and professor of mechanical engineering  who was co-director of the LFM program from 1994 until 1998  worked with Rosenfield for nearly three decades.“To those of us who have lived the full life of the program  Don was the keeper of the culture  the best friend to the students  and the one who made the whole system work” by balancing the goals of everyone involved  Hardt said.Students  alumni  faculty  and staff of the LFM/LGO program formed a sort of extended family. Rosenfield was known to call each admitted student personally and was regularly present at program events  even after his retirement as program director in 2014. His retirement party  dubbed “DonFest ” drew hundreds of people for a reception at Fenway Park and a conference examining the history of the program  as well as Rosenfield’s contributions to operations research and education. That year  the Leaders for Global Operations program received the UPS George D. Smith Prize for its work preparing students “to be good practitioners of operations research ” according to a forthcoming paper by Rosenfield and Perakis in the academic journal Interfaces.Colleagues cited Rosenfield’s fantastic memory. He employed his ability to recall details to great effect when keeping tabs on nearly every student who went through the LGO program  more than 1 200 in all. His memory also served him well as an avid Boston sports fan. Magnanti said Rosenfield knew the score of every game in the historic Red Sox 1967 “Impossible Dream” season.Rosenfield’s own family was part of the extended MIT family. While he was an MIT graduate himself  with three degrees  his wife Nancy also holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from MIT. All three of their children earned bachelor’s degrees from MIT — one for Jennifer  one for Todd  and two for Adam. Todd graduated from the LGO program in 2014  adding two master’s degrees. In all  the Rosenfield familyholds ten MIT degrees.“I think he took great pride in his family and all they’ve accomplished  and I think he also was greatly honored to be part of MIT ” said Stephen Graves  the Abraham J. Siegel Professor of Management and a professor of operations management at MIT Sloan.Rosenfield also conducted research  including a chapter in “Production in the Innovation Economy ” based on his work with the MIT Task Force on Production and Innovation. He also supervised thesis work for many of the program’s students.After stepping down as LGO program director  Rosenfield continued to teach for the operations management group at MIT Sloan. He taught Course 15.769 (Operations Strategy) in the fall and Course 15.784 (Operations Lab) in the spring. He was slated to teach Operations Lab again in the Spring 2018 semester. Last semester  he taught Operations Strategy with adjunct associate professor Zeynep Ton. He intended it to be his last time teaching the course. A surprise visit by Harvard Business School professor Roy Shapiro — a classmate of Rosenfield’s from MIT — made the last day of class an emotional event  Perakis said.Rosenfield first came to MIT in 1965 and earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics  an electrical engineer degree  and a master’s degree in operations research in 1971. (He deferred completion of his bachelor’s degree while working on the others). He earned his PhD in operations research at Stanford University in 1974. While a student at MIT  he worked at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory where he “developed computerized prediction models for defense applications ” according to his CV.Prior to joining MIT Sloan full time  Rosenfield also taught at Harvard Business School  the State University of New York College of Urban and Policy Sciences  and the Boston University School of Management (now the Questrom School of Business). In the 1970s and 1980s  he was a senior consultant at Arthur D. Little  Inc. in Cambridge  where he specialized in operations management  including manufacturing strategy  logistics strategy  and production and inventory planning.Rosenfield was the co-author of at least five case studies  including examinations of Boeing Commercial Airplanes  Dell Inc.  and the Tesla Roadster. He was the co-author of two books  “Operations Strategy: Competing in the 21st Century ” published in 2007  and “Modern Logistics Management: Integrating Marketing  Manufacturing and Physical Distribution ” published in 1985.Throughout his career  Rosenfield was a friend  mentor  and leader whom colleagues remembered for his kindness and the personal attention he gave to each individual. Perakis said Rosenfield was the kindest person she ever met  and she recalled that the pair exchanged books at Christmas each year as gifts.“Don was the most unselfish person you could find at MIT ” Graves said. “Honest  always positive  always willing to help  caring  with just a great attitude.”Donald Barry Rosenfield was born July 24  1947 in Boston. He is survived by his wife  Nancy; his mother  Miriam; his children Jennifer  Todd (Runa)  and Adam; two grandchildren; a brother  Alan; and a sister  Cheryl. He lived in Lexington  Massachusetts.
Remembering Raymond F. Baddour  professor emeritus of chemical engineering,Raymond F. Baddour  the Lammot du Pont Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering at MIT  died peacefully at his home Dec. 15  2017  surrounded by his family.Baddour received a BS in chemical engineering from the University of Notre Dame. He received his SM in chemical engineering practice at MIT in 1949 and  upon earning his ScD from MIT in 1951  became an assistant professor in the department. He became a full professor in 1963 and founded MIT's Environmental Laboratory in 1970  becoming its first director. Baddour was head of the Department of Chemical Engineering from 1969 to 1976 and was awarded the Lammot du Pont Professorship in 1969.While department head  Baddour put together and executed a visionary plan to expand the department's programs in energy and environmental engineering  bioengineering  and applied chemistry. He launched a bold and aggressive hiring initiative that broke with longstanding departmental traditions; now  30 years later  Course 10 continues to see the positive impact of his vision.The current home of the Department of Chemical Engineering is a physical example of Baddour’s impact: In order to revitalize and address space concerns for new faculty and research programs  Baddour conceived of the plan to create the Ralph Landau Building (Building 66). He also raised funds for the building completely through private sources  an act that has not been duplicated at the Institute since.“Professor Baddour has left a great legacy in the department that has touched on almost every aspect of the department’s history and success ” says Paula Hammond  the David H. Koch Professor in Engineering and current department head. “Ray was an institution and a real driver at the biotechnology and pharmaceutical interface when it was still very new in the field of chemical engineering. As a teacher  he will be remembered as an inspirational educator who imbued a generation of students with a passion for chemical engineering.”In 2014  Baddour made a generous gift to endow the Raymond F. Baddour (1949) Professorship in Chemical Engineering  established to support a distinguished faculty member in the department. Bernhardt Trout is the first and current recipient of the Baddour Professorship.Baddour was also a role model for entrepreneurship: He started his first company in 1962  and in 1980 co-founded the biopharmaceutical company Amgen  serving as director until 1987. In addition  he was a co-founder of Ascent Pediatrics  MatTek Corp.  BREH Partners  BREHK Inc.  BLW Corp.  Enterprise Management Corp.  SKB Inc.  Energy Resource Co.  Abcor Inc.  and Amicon Corp.Baddour served as director at ActivBiotics Inc.  Scully Signal Co.  Hyseq Inc.  Lam Research Corp.  and the Raychem Corp. He was chairman of ERCO  AG. Baddour was a consultant to Oxbow Corp.  Mobil Chemical Co.  Freeport Minerals Co.  Allied Chemical Co.  Roger Milliken and Co.  Loeb  Rhodes  and Co.  LFE Corp.  Stauffer Chemical Co.

Martin Rein  former professor of urban studies and planning  dies at 89,Martin Rein  professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning from 1970 until his retirement in 2011  died on Oct. 15 of complications from Alzheimer’s disease. He was 89.Rein was born in Brooklyn  New York  to Eastern European immigrants. After graduating from Brooklyn College in 1950  he got his first job as a social worker with street gangs  which triggered his lifelong interest in writing and doing research on poverty  social planning and reform  and the social work profession.He enrolled at Columbia University’s School of Social Work  and went on to get a PhD at Brandeis University in 1961. After seven years teaching future social workers at Bryn Mawr College’s Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research  Rein landed at MIT  where he remained for more than four decades.Rein’s early career was devoted to the study of the welfare state  primarily across European and Anglo-Saxon countries  comparing them in particular to the United States. Every country looked different  with its own complicated rules and programs. Although he was very familiar with the detailed features of programs in many countries  he was also trying to look for patterns across them. Looking beyond the details  were there commonalities across countries  and what were the real differences? He did comparative analyses at various levels  looking at impacts of programs on individuals as well as at the overall structure of programs and institutionally how they functioned.“As a sociologist working with urban planning students  Marty played a major role in cultivating analytical skills in students who are usually idealistic ” noted Bish Sanyal  professor and former head of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “Marty’s research with Donald Schön on problem framing is a book which planners need to read even so many years after the publication of the book. His book on 'Dilemmas of Social Reform'remains required reading for all interested in social policies.”Later in his career  Rein’s main interest was retirement policy. At the individual level for retirement income  Rein did extensive data analysis of “income packaging.” Retirement income can come from many sources  among them public social security  private pensions and saving plans  and ongoing work. He had individual data on the components of income of the elderly across many countries.In the aggregate  there seemed to be similarities among countries with large and small public programs  since some countries depended more on private programs. The aggregate resources devoted to retirement — public and private — in the United States  for example  were not much smaller than in countries with larger public welfare states because of extensive private pensions. When Rein examined the top 10 percent of older people or the bottom 10 percent  however  the differences were much more pronounced. Taking account of both public and private income sources  he found large differences in inequality among older people between countries even though aggregates were sometimes more similar. Rein realized that the whole impact of the welfare state could not be understood without taking account of both public and private sources of retirement income.Within the public sector  Rein was also interested in how programs might not be what they seemed. Countries tend to develop distinct programs to deal with seemingly separate problems  such as unemployment  disability  and retirement. But over time  he concluded that programs developed for one purpose often came to be used for another. For example  unemployment insurance is targeted at unemployment  but when benefits run out in countries with high unemployment  people turn to other programs  seeking to qualify for disability benefits or if they are old enough  for early retirement benefits.The neat dividing lines that supposedly separate programs tend to blur  and all of these programs can become  in part  unemployment programs. The blurring also can go in other directions. While studying early retirement  Rein noticed that workers who were not yet old enough for retirement programs could effectively withdraw from employment early by drawing on unemployment insurance for a while  or on disability benefits — so the disability and unemployment programs could become in part de facto early retirement programs. Of course  once the blurring became obvious enough  countries would try to take corrective actions  and Rein followed the political responses.Rein wrote and co-wrote many books on social policy and social reform. Among the most well known were "Dilemmas of Social Reform " with Peter Marris  which became a classic work on the origins of community action  and "Social Policy: Issues of Choice and Change and Frame Reflection " with Donald Schön  which explored why controversies over public policy are so difficult to resolve.According to Rein’s daughter  her father was an accomplished scholar who was charming  warm  and an extrovert. “He loved Rachmaninoff  a good Gewurztraminer  tending his many orchids  and cooking a good duck confit ” says Lisa Rein  who currently resides in Washington. “He loved Yiddish songs and learned German in his spare time. He never bought a new car.”Rein is survived by his sister; his two children  Lisa Rein of Silver Spring  Maryland and Glen Rein of Rohnert Park  California; and numerous nieces and nephews  as well as former wives Mildred Rein of Boston and Dalia Marin of Munich  Germany. The family is developing plans for a memorial event; information will be provided on the website of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning when available.
Remembering Christine Moulen  library systems manager at the MIT Libraries,Christine Moulen ’94  library systems manager at the MIT Libraries  passed away on Saturday after a battle with cancer. She was 44.A libraries employee for more than 20 years  Moulen was a three-time recipient of the Infinite Mile Award and a universally admired colleague.“Christine was one of the most beloved and well-respected colleagues at the MIT Libraries ” said Director Chris Bourg. “We have lost an extraordinary human being — warm  brilliant  kind  and with a quick smile that few of us will ever forget.”Moulen began working in the MIT Libraries as a freshman in Course 16 and remained a student employee throughout her undergraduate years. She enjoyed the work so much  she stayed on in a full-time position after graduating with a BS in aeronautics and astronautics in 1994. She began as monograph acquisitions assistant  became monograph acquisitions section head in 1996  and was promoted to library systems manager in 1997.Moulen’s excellence was recognized not only by her MIT colleagues but also among a global community of peers. In 2016  she received the Azriel Morag Award for Innovation from Ex Libris  “presented annually to a librarian who has shown innovation and initiative.” Moulen was recognized for her contributions to Aleph  the library system underlying the MIT Libraries Barton catalog. The award committee lauded Moulen’s above-and-beyond contributions to this industry community: “Christine’s innovation is not a one-time creation.

Vanu Bose  software pioneer and MIT Corporation member  dies at 52 ,Vanu Bose ’87  SM ’94  PhD ’99  a leading software executive and a member of the MIT Corporation with deep ties to the Institute  died on Saturday at age 52. The cause of his death was a sudden pulmonary embolism.Bose was the founder and CEO of Vanu  Inc.  an innovative firm that provides wireless infrastructure globally and was the first company to receive certification for software-defined radio from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.The firm’s technology  emerging from Bose’s graduate research at MIT  increases the role of software in operating the radio-based component of wireless communications networks  including those used for cellphone communications. Among other things  the technology enables multiple networks to operate on the same devices.Vanu  Inc. has also developed cellular antenna systems that require relatively small amounts of energy and can run on solar power. The reduction in power needed for these networks has allowed the firm to help build out networks in rural areas around the world  from India to Rwanda to Vermont  and to address what Bose called the “great need for communication” in those areas.Bose also recognized the humanitarian possibilities of the technology  and put the company to work this fall providing urgent help in hurricane-struck Puerto Rico. Vanu  Inc. is providing over 40 cellular base stations in Puerto Rico  some of which have already helped people find their missing families.“That makes it all worthwhile  right there ” Bose told Boston’s WBUR radio in October.Bose had lifelong ties to MIT  growing up around the Institute in an environment filled with faculty  students  and alumni. His father  the late Amar G. Bose  was a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) for nearly a half-century. Amar G. Bose also founded the Bose Corporation in 1964 and was one of the most committed benefactors the Institute has seen.“The ‘Bose’ name has long been synonymous with brilliance  humility  leadership  and integrity ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “Through his work to use cellular technology to connect the unconnected — most recently  in Puerto Rico — Vanu embodied the very best of the MIT community  advancing the Institute's vision for a better world. He was deeply proud of his father  Amar  and of Amar's impact as an engineer  entrepreneur  and executive. And he built an extraordinary legacy of his own that I know made Amar proud.”Reif added: “On behalf of MIT  I send my deepest condolences to Judy  Kamala  Prema  Maya  Ursula  and the entire Bose family.”Vanu Bose earned three degrees from MIT: his Bachelor of Science in 1988  in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  and Mathematics; his Master of Science in 1994  in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; and his PhD in 1999.Bose’s doctoral thesis  titled “Virtual Radio Architecture ” was supervised by professors John Guttag and David Tennenhouse. Bose’s graduate research came to form the basis of Vanu  Inc.  which he founded in 1998  even before Bose had fully completed his PhD work — but after it had become clear that his work had the potential to move the industry forward.As a life-long participant in the open  collaborative intellectual atmosphere around MIT  Bose came to appreciate the way MIT alumni who founded companies would stay connected to the Institute and pass on their own insights and pieces of wisdom to students and researchers in the community.“I think it’s a unique part of the MIT experience that there are not only so many great founders around  but that they make themselves accessible ” Bose told the EECSConnector  an alumni publication  in 2015.As a company founder and alumnus himself  Bose made sure to continue the tradition of working to support new generations of MIT researchers. At the time of his death  he was engaged in fostering and guiding theBose Fellows Programat MIT  an initiative founded in 2014 that gives grants of up to $500 000 for three years  to let faculty members pursue bold  cutting-edge research programs.“My father would be very happy with the innovation and freedom of exploration that these grants have made possible  as it was exactly what he was all about ” said Bose in 2016  when announcing the latest group of grant recipients. “The awards acknowledge the spirit of insatiable curiosity that my father embraced.”Vanu Bose also served on the advisory board of the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program  an initiative that adds leadership education to the engineering skills of MIT undergraduates.And from 2013 onward  Bose served as a member of the MIT Corporation  the Institute’s board of trustees.“We are all shocked to lose Vanu Bose  a warm and valuable member of our community ” says Robert B. Millard  chairman of the MIT Corporation. “And our hearts go out to Vanu’s family  which has been such an indelible part of MIT.  We've really lost a beautiful human.”In turn  Bose’s MIT activities were only part of a larger set of civic responsibilities he assumed during his career. Bose was a member of the Board of Trustees for the Boston Museum of Science from 2007 through 2013  helping steer it through a period of growth and development. He also served on the United Nations Broadband Commission for Digital Development  from 2012 through 2015.In his professional career  Bose also served the Bose Corp. as a member of its Trustee Succession Committee.Bose won a number of awards and honors in his professional career  includingIEEE Spectrummagazine’s “Wireless Winner” in 2007  and the GSM Association Technology Award for Most Innovative Infrastructure Product. He was also named a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.Vanu Bose is survived by his wife  Judith  his daughter  Kamala  his mother  Prema  his sister  Maya and his father's wife  Ursula.A celebration of Vanu’s life will take place on Saturday  Nov. 25  at 10 a.m. in Room 26-100 (50 Vassar Street). Complimentary parking will be provided for guests in the Stata Center Garage  32 Vassar Street.
Remembering and honoring the life of undergraduate Henoch Argaw,In the 3rd grade  Henoch Argaw began tutoring his fellow students at Southeast Christian Academy Elementary School in Colorado.“He told me and Sehin [his mother] that he was writing a math instruction book ” recalls Neway Argaw  his father. “By that time  he was already attending 5th grade [level] math and science courses.” Their son continued tutoring all the way through high school and also took up a related pursuit  refereeing and coaching youth soccer for the Colorado Storm and other Colorado soccer clubs. He was also a competitive chess player and played the trumpet since 4th grade.Mustafa Amjad  a student at University of Pennsylvania who met Argaw when he was attending the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) Jordan program  writes: “He was always willing to help and offer his advice whenever I needed it and I was truly inspired by the breadth of his knowledge.”Argaw  a second-year MIT student who passed away unexpectedly in late September  inspired countless others during his time at MIT and elsewhere. He was 19 years old. A resident of East Campus  Argaw was pursuing one of the Institute’s newest majors  6-14 (Computer Science  Economics and Data Science) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). The major was a perfect fit  as he had been enamored of complex analysis from an early age.In middle school  Argaw’s proclivity for math and science garnered him a presidential award for education excellence  and he went on to attend and win numerous STEM competitions prior to coming to MIT. “For two consecutive years he was the highest scorer in his middle-school math competition and highest among all 7th and 8th grade students from across his school district ” his father says.His close friend  Benjamin Farnsworth  writes that he and Argaw formed a bond over being the only two 6th graders in Algebra 1 class — but also notes his broader interests and playful humor: “I remember countless hours playing Mario Hoops on our Nintendo DSs and practicing musical duets. One time  we went to preform 'Ode to Joy' for the school talent show  and we accidentally repeated it at separate times. The result: We both burst out in laughter for a good two minutes  to our embarrassment. Every time we heard 'Ode to Joy' after that  we couldn't help but smile.”As with mathematics  music and languages came easily to Argaw. Born in Tampere  Finland  he was fluent or near-fluent in Amharic  Arabic  Mandarin and English. Argaw shared on a personal profile page that he had “learned a substantial amount of Arabic … after starting with barely any knowledge of the language” during an internship this past summer at liwwa  Inc.  a peer-to-peer lending company in Amman  Jordan.Ahmed Moor  co-founder and CEO of the firm writes “He had an easy and generous way of grinning at you; it always brightened my day. I'm grateful for the short time I had with him. The pain of his loss goes deep  but the joy of having known him goes deeper.”Argaw’s ability to weave together his interests was impressive  as demonstrated in 2013 when he designed and developed a mobile app for Chinese language flashcards. To do so  all he had to do was master programming from scratch. Likewise  he applied his mathematical gifts to economic issues  first as a summer E2 (Engineering Experience at MIT) participant  where he focused on trading  optimization  and portfolio management; and later as an undergraduate researcher at the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative  creating an open-source solution for private cryptocurrency transactions. His most recent project included developing an artificial poker player/robot that won him and his partner $500 in a competition with more than 40 other competitors.Beyond academics  he belonged to Sigma Alpha Epsilon  served as an officer for the MIT Club Sports Council  treasurer of the MIT Ethiopian-Eritrean Student Association (MIT-EESA)  and participated in numerous campus activities  including the MIT Taekwondo Club  the Bitcoin Club  and the Skydiving Club. His many interests were a reflection of his multifaceted personality  as underscored by a eulogy given by Argaw’s cousin: “Henoch was more than just his academic achievements… more than his comprehensive abilities and it should be the last thing to define him. … I’m not going to miss Henoch the student  I am going to miss Henoch the human being.”Moreover  his sister Peniel adds  “Henoch had many more attributes than just being smart  he had a genuine care and kindness for others. Whether he had a huge assignment due the next day or not  Henoch would always be there for the people he loved. He knew the true meaning of putting others before himself  which continues to inspire me to this day.”Argaw’s mother calls him her “trophy ” celebrating his generosity  his firm ethical principles  such as always standing for the truth  and his dedication to reading the Bible. “As many said  Henoch was very smart but what surprised me was how he could teach himself anything from scratch  from tying a cravat to day-to-day things like cooking to sophisticated things like programming and stock analysis.” Moreover  rather than complaining about uncomfortable situations  she adds  he always made the best use of his circumstances. “He had so many questions still unanswered. I know he will get all the answers in Heaven.”On his LinkedIn profile  Argaw described himself and his hopes as both practical and philosophical  writing: “Since a very young age software  computers  and the internet have been critically important to me as a clear display of how humanity can shape the world around it to pursue its desire and its higher purpose. … I would like to further my studies in artificial intelligence and also work to produce a product in AI that will allow people to walk further in their journey — discovering more than anyone prior had imagined.”A campus memorial service will be held on Saturday  Nov. 4 from 4 to 5 p.m. in the MIT Chapel.
Celebrating the life of doctoral student and alumnus Michael B. Cohen,Michael B. Cohen ’14  SM ’16 had a deep love for mathematics and the theoretical foundations of computing — a love that was infectious  brilliant  and always shared with others. Cohen  a doctoral student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)  died suddenly from natural causes in September. He was 25 years of age.At the time of his passing  Cohen was visiting the University of California at Berkeley  where he had gone to meet with colleagues at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. A member of the Theory of Computing group at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT  he had roots in the Washington area.Daniela Rus  the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director CSAIL  said  “We are all still stunned by the news of the passing of Michael Cohen. Michael was a beloved student at CSAIL  a brilliant colleague in the theory group  and a joyful presence everywhere he went. This is a huge and collective loss for the entire CSAIL community.”A service will be held on Friday  Nov. 10  at 3 p.m. in Building 32-G449  followed by a reception in R&D Commons.Cohen first came to MIT as an undergraduate student  and he lived in East Campus. He earned his bachelor’s in mathematics in 2014  having skipped his second year at MIT to work at Facebook. He then stayed on at MIT to pursue a graduate degree in computer science.Scott Aaronson  a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who taught at MIT from 2007 to 2016  recalled Cohen as a particularly motivated first year student  ready to solve open problems  or basically tackle anything.Writing on his blog  Aaronson noted that when he met Cohen he realized at once that he “was a freshman who I could — must — talk to like an advanced grad student or professor.” In his class on quantum complexity theory  Cohen had the habit of sitting in the front row and carrying on dialogues with Aaronson  often catching any errors or “unjustified claims.” At the same time  Aaronson was impressed by Cohen’s intellectual humility  as his focus was on understanding and clarifying tough concepts for everyone in the class  not showing off. Such openness led to Cohen “having a huge circle of friends.”His fellow MIT students described him as “energetic  fun  and supportive ” and admired his irrepressible spirit of “exuberance and generosity.” Cameron Musco  a doctoral student in the same lab as Cohen and a frequent co-author  wrote  “It was impossible to ignore his energy  wonder  and excitement for research  current events  and everything in between.” Cohen was a notable presence on the 5th and 6th floors of the Stata Center at MIT  Musco also recalled  “always … surrounded by a group of friends happy to banter or simply to listen. He was a natural teacher — truly kind  humble  welcoming  positive  and always willing to slow his thoughts for a moment to share his brilliance.”Cohen was an intellectual tour-de-force beyond the campus as well. He spent a summer at Microsoft Research  where he quickly cemented a reputation for “his larger-than-life personality” and academic brilliance. A statement by the team he worked with at Microsoft read: “Michael was a brilliant mathematician and a rising star in his field. … [H]e made sweeping progress in online learning and online algorithms  two fields he had just recently become acquainted with. In addition to solving five open problems in these areas  he continued his substantial progress on the k-server problem  one of the most celebrated and notoriously difficult challenges in the space of adaptive algorithms.”Sebastien Bubeck  a researcher in the Theory Group at Microsoft Research who worked alongside Cohen  shared what he called a “typical Michael story ” about when they first met in October 2016 at MIT: “We were about to start lunch with a small group of graduate students and Michael entered the room  he (gently) interrupted the conversation and his first sentence to me was a question about mirror descent that I was not able to answer. (We now know the answer  and as it turns out his question was pretty deep and the answer highly non-trivial.)”Bubeck  like many others  was also struck by Cohen’s remarkable way of doing mathematics  primarily never writing anything on paper. James R. Lee  a professor of computer science at University of Washington  said  “His mind was always going at 100 mph  so it was remarkable that he didn’t miss a beat in calibrating (i.e.  slowing down) for an audience (or for those who did not know him).”Luca Trevisan  a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Berkeley  noted that “in a few short years  Michael left his mark on a number of problems.” At the time of his death  Cohen was credited as a co-author on papers with more than 30 distinct collaborators. Tom Cohen  Michael’s father  remarked that his son  “more than anything  wished to become part of that community and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant research in the field.” Cleary  he achieved that and much more  becoming a leading light in the theoretical computer science community.As Lee wrote  “one got the sense that this was all a warmup for Michael. It’s really disheartening that we won’t get to see what comes next.” He and others have committed to ensuring that Cohen’s work is more than just remembered  but spread far and wide and used to tackle the kinds of open problems that he adored.Those wishing to making contributions in Cohen’s name should considergivedirectly.org  a charity he admired that provides money to individuals in extreme poverty in Kenya and Uganda.A memorial service to honor Cohen's memory will take place on Friday  Nov. 10  at 3 p.m. in Room 32-G449 (Kiva)  and will be followed by a reception in R&D Commons.
Stanislaw Olbert  professor emeritus of physics and a pioneering theorist of the space age  dies at 94,Stanislaw “Stan” OlbertPhD ’53  professor emeritus of physics and a distinguished researcher with MIT’sSpace Plasma Group  died from a heart attack on Sept. 23. He was 94.Olbert fought with the Polish underground during World War II  came to MIT on a scholarship to earn his doctorate  and  as a member of MIT’s Space Plasma Group  was one of the pioneer theorists of the space age. He specialized in the understanding of the solar wind  the streams of atomic particles flowing outward from the sun. He participated in  and brought insight to  the measurements of the solar wind with instruments on several NASA space missions  including theVoyager missionsto the outer planets and interstellar space.Born in 1923  Olbert was raised by his widowed mother in a small village in Eastern Poland. He showed early academic promise  and  during the Russian occupation of 1939 to 1941  he concentrated in math and physics under Russian teachers. Under the subsequent German occupation of 1941  however  his studies were interrupted. He was forced to work as a mason  and later  because he spoke German  as a bookkeeper on a German-run farm. He secretly shared information about German-bound food shipments for later interception by the Polish underground.In 1944  he fought in the Warsaw uprising and  at the surrender  was taken prisoner by the Germans. At the war’s end  Olbert was declared a "displaced person" and enrolled at the University of Munich to resume his studies in math and physics. He earned a scholarship to the doctoral program of MIT’s Department of Physics in 1949. With the Cosmic Ray Group led by ProfessorBruno Rossi  he earned his doctorate in 1953  became an assistant professor in 1957  and became full professor in 1967; he retired in 1988.Following his thesis research  Olbert studied the properties of high-energy nuclear interactions and the extensive air showers — large cascades of atomic particles propagating through the atmosphere — that are produced by those interactions. This provided the first theoretical framework in which the implications of various assumptions about the basic cascade processes could be worked out for comparison with observed shower phenomena.Olbert’s research in the field of space plasmas began with a study of the origins of cosmic rays in our galaxy. This work  performed in collaboration with Rossi and Professor Philip Morrison  led Olbert into fundamental investigations of individual and collective behavior of charged particles in the interplanetary environment.The results of these investigations became the basis of two MIT graduate courses. One of these  taught in collaboration with Rossi  led to the publication of a textbook on the subject  "Introduction to the Physics of Space" (McGraw-Hill  1970).“Professor Olbert was the theoretical backbone of MIT’s Space Plasma Group ” said his colleagueHale Bradt  professor emeritus of physics. The group flew instruments in numerous space missions to study the solar wind  beginning with its first in situ measurement with Explorer 10 in 1961  and including the 1977 launches ofVoyager I and Voyager II. Even today  the Voyagers continue to send data from in and beyond the heliosphere. Among other contributions  Olbert engaged in theoretical studies of a variety of mechanisms that could be responsible for the generation of stellar winds.From 1979 to 1986  Olbert undertook two major research projects: the self-consistent solution of the problem of solar wind dynamics  and theoretical studies of radiation generated by solid conductors moving through a magnetized plasma. Olbert maintained contact with many graduate and undergraduate students who have since become well-known in the field of space research.“He gave me private lessons on the physics of space plasmas  which had not been covered in my coursework ” said Olbert’s last doctoral student  Alan Barnett PhD ’83. “His cheerful and optimistic outlook was infectious.”In the 1980s  Olbert was a frequent visitor to the University of Rome and the Arcetri Observatory in Florence; and  in 1991  at the Institute for Cosmic Studies in Warsaw  Poland. He collaborated abroad and at home with former students and associates on various projects. One of these papers  in 2003  provides methods for the visualization of the motion of electromagnetic fields that have been used in the teaching of freshman physics both at MIT and around the world. His last first-author paper was published in 2012  at the age of 89. Until late in his life  Olbert kept up with current events with regular reading of newspapers in German  Italian  Polish  and English.He and his family lived in Melrose  Massachusetts  and later in Cambridge  with summers spent on their New Hampshire farm. Olbert is survived by his wife  Norma (DeVivo)  and their two children  Thomas of Cambridge  and Elizabeth of Farmington  Maine  where she is adjunct professor at the University of Maine.In 1980  Elizabeth created the abstract painting "Jupiter " inspired by the Voyager spacecraft images; it hangs in the headquarters of MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. In 2014  Norma published a biography of Olbert’s early years in Poland and Germany  "The Boy from Lwów" (CreateSpace  2014)  for which Thomas wrote the foreword and Elizabeth designed the cover.Olbert’s body was cremated  and there will be no funeral service. A memorial gathering will be announced in the near future.
Former MIT President Paul Gray dies at 85 after lifelong career of service and leadership at the Institute,Paul Gray ’54  SM ’55  ScD ’60  a devoted leader at MIT whose lifetime career at the Institute included turns as a student  professor  dean of engineering  associate provost  chancellor  president  and MIT Corporation chair  died today at his home in Concord  Massachusetts  after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 85.As MIT’s 14th president  from 1980 to 1990  and in his other roles  Gray transformed the Institute through his commitment to enhancing undergraduate education and increasing the presence of women and underrepresented minorities on campus. With his wife  Priscilla King Gray  at his side  he helped guide MIT through the social change and technological transformation that marked the second half of the 20th century.His commitment to MIT  particularly to its students  was absolute. Even after retiring as MIT Corporation chair in 1997  he returned to teaching and advising. His work at the Institute was carried out in partnership with Priscilla  a champion of public service who led efforts to create a sense of community at MIT and co-founded what is now called the Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center.“Paul Gray led MIT with the clear-eyed pragmatism and uncommon steadiness of a born engineer  and the humility  warmth  and wisdom of an exceptional human being ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “He was an indispensable advisor to two MIT presidents who preceded him and all three who have followed him. His affection for and trust in our students allowed him to serve as an anchor at MIT during the turbulence of the Vietnam War; inspired him to greatly increase the presence and profile of underrepresented minority and women students in our community; and led him to pioneer the creation of the then-revolutionary Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program  now an inseparable part of the MIT experience. Paul loved the MIT community like family — and we feel his loss like family  too.”“Paul became my first and most essential guide to MIT. With the wisdom gained from a lifetime devoted to the Institute  he showed me MIT’s ethos and history ” says MIT President Emerita Susan Hockfield  who served as president of the Institute from 2004 to 2012. “Whether at dinner with his newly red-coated Class of ’54 classmates  or walking the Infinite Corridor with wonderful Priscilla — love of his life and partner in a presidency of warmth and purpose — his love of the place  of the people  and of our mission shone brightly in all he said and did. A part of me has always and will always see MIT through his eyes.”A vigorous embrace of diversityWhen Gray arrived at MIT as an undergraduate  women made up less than 2 percent of each MIT class  and the percentage of underrepresented minorities was similarly low. After joining the administration  he took up the charge to make the MIT community more representative of society at large.In 1968  in response to recommendations from the newly created Black Students Union  Gray  who was then associate provost  and others created the Task Force on Educational Opportunity. Among other efforts  they hired an assistant director of admissions and worked with him to actively recruit minority students. MIT also began the landmark summer program Project Interphase  staffed largely by students of color.As chancellor  Gray wrote and began implementing the Institute’s first formal plan to increase the presence of women and minorities among MIT’s faculty as well as its student body. In a 2008MIT Infinite History interview  Gray recalled that these efforts represented a sea change for the Institute. Until that time  “MIT had never recruited [any students]. We waited for applications to come ” he said.By the time he stepped down from the presidency in 1990  women made up more than 30 percent of incoming undergraduate classes  and underrepresented minorities constituted 14 percent. Gray’s efforts had laid the foundation for MIT’s subsequent leaders to further increase diversity and inclusion at the Institute. His work on diversity among students and the faculty “may be the most important thing I did around here ” Gray said in the Infinite History interview.One of the first members of the Black Students Union was Shirley Ann Jackson ’68  PhD ’73  who is now the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a life member of the MIT Corporation. “For me  Paul was foremost a great friend  advisor  supporter  and confidante. I always turned to him at critical junctures in my career. He never failed me — his advice and guidance were always spot on ” Jackson says.Reshaping undergraduate educationEven after becoming a full-time administrator in the 1970s  Gray maintained a close connection with the Institute’s students. He earned his bachelor’s  master’s  and doctoral degrees from MIT  all in electrical engineering  in 1954  1955  and 1960  respectively. After three years of teaching as an instructor  he joined the faculty in 1960 and became the MIT Class of 1922 Professor of Electrical Engineering from 1968 to 1971. He was associate dean for student affairs from 1965 to 1967  associate provost from 1969 to 1970  and dean of the School of Engineering from 1970 to 1971.“To me  he is the iconic president of MIT because he was made out of pure Institute clay  as an undergraduate  graduate  professor  and academic leader ” says Institute Professor Emeritus John Deutch  who served as MIT provost from 1985 to 1990. “As his provost  I witnessed his endless devotion to education and scholarship. His love for Priscilla and his family matched his love for MIT.”In his Infinite History interview  Gray reflected on his early days of teaching  which he did alongside Harold “Doc” Edgerton  another popular MIT professor: “I found it enormously satisfying. Demanding  but very satisfying. And somewhere in that two-year interval  with teaching every semester  I came to the conclusion that this is what I want to do with my life.”As a professor  Gray was part of an effort in the 1960s to overhaul the way electrical engineering was taught  moving the focus away from vacuum tubes and squarely onto semiconductor electronics. In support of this transition  Gray wrote seven textbooks and other materials  working with MIT colleagues as well as others at Stanford University  the University of California at Berkeley  Raytheon  and IBM.Gray joined the MIT administration full-time when he accepted the position of chancellor  serving from 1971 to 1980  followed by a decade as MIT president. He was chairman of the MIT Corporation from 1991 to 1997.As associate provost  Gray championed professor Margaret MacVicar SB '64  ScD '67 and her innovative proposal to create a program that would involve undergraduates in faculty research. The result was the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)  one of the earliest programs of its kind in the United States and now a national model  supporting thousands of projects each year. Today  90 percent of MIT graduating seniors participate in at least one UROP during their undergraduate years.As president  Gray committed himself to paying renewed attention to the “pace  coherence  and intellectual impact” of the undergraduate experience.To this end  he helped make a number of reforms to MIT’s undergraduate curriculum. He reaffirmed the pass/no record grading system for freshman that he had helped implement while associate provost. He also launched a formal review of an undergraduate curriculum that until then had been largely focused on engineering  mathematics  and the physical sciences. This led to the addition of biology to the core requirements  as well as a strengthening of the offerings in the humanities and social sciences.“There may be no single person in modern history who has had such an impact on MIT as Paul Gray ” says MIT Corporation Life Member Emeritus Jim Champy ’63  SM ’65. “So much of what we experience at MIT today was begun by Paul. I worked for him in my years at MIT while he was chancellor  and knew him later as a friend and Corporation member. For all the magnitude of his impact  Paul — together with Priscilla — brought a genuine warmth and caring for every student and member of the MIT community.”Responding to national and international trendsIn broadening the MIT curriculum  Gray was also carrying out another of his goals: to rededicate science and technology as socially powerful activities.“We continue to hear the complaint that … many of our human and social ills are the direct result of unanticipated and deleterious artifacts of technology  foisted upon the world by technicians with tunnel vision ” he said in his inaugural address.“It is clear  however  that the future development not only of this nation  but of the world  is inexorably tied to continued scientific progress and to the humane and thoughtful applications of science ” Gray continued. “What is needed is not a retreat from science and technology  but a more complete science and technology. We must strive to develop among ourselves  among our students  and in the public at large  an understanding of the fact that engineering and science are  by their very nature  humanistic enterprises.”Gray furthered his vision of a science and engineering enterprise in service of society while developing new ventures at MIT and representing the Institute in Washington.In 1986  with the economic recessions of the 1970s and early 1980s still a recent memory  MIT under Gray’s leadership created the Commission on Industrial Productivity. The group  which comprised 17 MIT faculty members  produced the landmark study “Made in America: Regaining the Productive Edge ” which examined the causes of the recent slowdown in U.S. productivity growth and made recommendations for improved economic performance.Gray also helped establish the Leaders for Manufacturing Program (now Leaders for Global Operations)  a joint effort by the MIT Sloan School of Management and the School of Engineering in partnership with top manufacturing companies. The program’s goal was to help students develop the technical  analytical  and business skills needed to lead strategic initiatives in high-tech  operations  and manufacturing companies.Also during his presidency  Gray implemented a plan to establish the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT. Initially headed by MIT Professor David Baltimore  the institute brought major new biology resources to MIT.Gray served for four years on the White House Science Council and the Council’s Panel on the Health of Universities. He was also vice chairman of the nonprofit Council on Competiveness. He was a staunch advocate for public understanding of science  federal support for research and higher education  and collaboration between academia and industry.Increasing MIT’s financial strengthFederal funding for science and technology research and for higher education had been at a historic high during the Sputnik era  but it declined significantly in the 1970s and remained stagnant in the ’80s  during Gray’s term as president.In 1987  MIT under Gray launched the five-year Campaign for the Future  which raised $710 million. And in 1994  while at the helm of the MIT Corporation  Gray played a lead role in the seven-year Campaign for MIT  which raised $2.05 billion  surpassing the original goal of $1.5 billion and bringing the Institute into a small group of universities — many with significantly larger alumni populations — that had comparably ambitious campaign goals. By the time Gray retired from the Corporation in 1997  MIT’s endowment was more than $2.1 billion.Gray also helped MIT secure funding from corporations in Japan  South Korea  and Taiwan  and created long-term partnerships with industry that provided relatively unconstrained support for MIT research.Much of Gray’s success in the fundraising arena can be credited to the personable approach both he and his wife brought to MIT.Many alumni have recalled the care the couple demonstrated toward MIT students. Together  the pair held weekly dinners for seniors in the president’s house — now known as Gray House — and visited dormitories and other student residences. They were often seen together on campus  talking with students  faculty  and staff from across the MIT community.“In the whole history of MIT  very few people have ever rivaled Paul Gray’s legacy of stewardship and service — as a faculty member  an administrator  an alumnus  a trustee  and a leader ” says Robert Millard ’73  chair of the MIT Corporation. “His nearly 50 years on the MIT Corporation included 26 as a member of the Executive Committee and  after his presidency  seven distinguished years as Corporation Chair. He played a pivotal role in countless key decisions  including the selection of MIT’s two most recent presidents. Universally respected and loved  Paul was — and remains — an inspiration to all of us charged with caring for what he called ‘this special place.’”Family at the center of lifePaul Edward Gray was born on Feb. 7  1932  in Newark  New Jersey. He cited his father  a technician at a public utility who never finished high school  as an influential figure who helped him discover his interest in electricity at an early age. By first or second grade  Gray was winding copper wire around nails to make electromagnets  and by age 10 he was repairing his neighbors’ radios. He built his own radio equipment and was a ham radio operator for many years.By high school  Gray knew he wanted to be an engineer. As an undergraduate at MIT  he joined the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity  enrolled in ROTC  and met Priscilla on a blind date. After earning his master’s degree and marrying Priscilla in 1955  he served in the U.S. Army for two years  then returned to MIT for further graduate study. Together  the Grays raised and educated four children. In his spare time  Gray played squash  made furniture in his woodshop  and enjoyed many outdoor activities with his family.Gray served on the board of directors of the Boeing Company and Eastman Kodak Company  and was a Life Trustee of the Boston Museum of Science and Wheaton College. He was a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.Gray is survived by his wife  Priscilla King Gray; by four children and their spouses — Virginia and Thomas Army  Amy and David Sluyter  Andrew and Yukiko Gray  and Louise and Timothy Huyck — and by 12 grandchildren  three of their spouses  and one great grandchild. He also leaves a sister-in-law and brother-in-law  Cynthia and Louis Schueler  and several nephews and nieces.Gifts in Gray’s memory may be made toMIT’s Aging Brain Initiativeto support research on Alzheimer’s disease. A memorial service will be held at Hancock United Church of Christ in Lexington on Oct. 1. An MIT memorial service is planned for 3:00 p.m. on Thursday  Nov. 30  in Kresge Auditorium.
Gene Brown  professor emeritus of biology  dies at 91,Gene M. Brown  MIT professor emeritus of biology  former department head  and former dean of the School of Science  passed away on Aug. 4 at the age of 91.“He was really the heart and soul of the department for a very long time  devoted to undergraduates and to teaching ” says MIT Professor Lisa Steiner. Steiner  an expert in the evolution and development of the immune system  was hosted by Brown during her recruitment visit to MIT and became the first female faculty member hired in the Department of Biology. “The idea of the department without him is quite shocking.”A pioneer in the field of intermediary metabolism  Brown’s research career focused on how living systems carry out chemical reactions in order to survive. He trained himself in enzymology after arriving at MIT  and he and his students and postdocs focused primarily on the enzymatic synthesis of several B vitamins  including thiamine  folic acid  riboflavin  and coenzyme A. He is best known for his work on the biosynthesis of folic acid and related compounds both in microorganisms and in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster  publishing over 100 research papers in his career.“Gene was a wonderful research advisor and teacher ” says Linda Spremulli  professor emerita of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  who was a graduate student with Brown from 1969 to 1973. “He transformed my life  instilling in me a love for the beauty of metabolic pathways with their complex mechanisms.”Growing up in rural Missouri and Idaho  Brown was the first member of his family to finish high school  and the only person in his graduating class to attend college. After a year as a college student in Idaho  Brown enlisted in the Army Air Forces  where he taught defensive measures against chemical warfare. After his term in the Army Air Forces  he returned to college at Colorado A & M College  where he majored in chemistry  graduating in 1949. He completed his graduate work at the University of Wisconsin in 1953 under the direction of Esmond Snell  isolating and characterizing the enzymatic synthesis of pantetheine  an analog of vitamin B5  and an intermediary in the production of coenzyme A.Brown continued working with Snell as a postdoc at the University of Texas until he was recruited by Professor Jack Buchanan to join the newly forming biochemistry division of the MIT Department of Biology in 1954. Brown served as executive officer of the department from 1967 to 1972; as associate department head under Professor Boris Magasanik from 1972 to 1977; as department head from 1977 to 1985; and as dean of the School of Science from 1985 to 1991. While serving as dean of science  Brown closed his research program. He officially retired from MIT in 1996  but continued teaching until 2014.Brown’s deepest passion was teaching. “As dean  he would leave meetings with the president of MIT to go teach ” recalls Professor Tom RajBhandary  who co-taught 7.05 (Introductory Biochemistry) with Brown for over 20 years. He was legendary for teaching intermediary metabolism without any notes  filling the boards of Room 10-250 with detailed pathways in meticulous handwriting. Brown got his first taste of teaching in high school  when his math and chemistry teachers would routinely call him to the board to explain the material. He was the first person in the Department of Biology to give open book and open note examinations  promoting the view that students should not have to memorize  but rather should be assessed for their ability to think and to solve problems. He was involved in teaching 7.05 for 60 years.“I loved teaching with Gene and will miss him ” says Professor Matthew vander Heiden  who currently teaches 7.05. “The privilege to see how he taught the class has had a tremendous impact on my own approach to teaching. I think he would be pleased to know that the unique insights he provided continue to be passed on each spring  and will continue to be passed on as long as I am involved in the course.”Teaching undergraduates was a value that extended throughout his career. As dean of science  he made it clear that the quality of teaching would be an important consideration for tenure decisions. He also co-chaired the committee that instituted the undergraduate communications requirement aimed at improving skills in both written and oral communications. The Department of Biology gives two teaching awards in his honor: The Gene Brown Prize  funded by Brown himself  recognizes teaching excellence among undergraduates; and the Gene Brown-Merck Teaching Award  funded by Merck and by Brown’s former graduate students and postdocs  recognizes teaching excellence among graduate students.During Brown’s administrative tenure in biology  the MIT Center for Cancer Research (the predecessor of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research) and the Whitehead Institute were established with Department of Biology faculty leadership (Professor Salvador Luria for the Center for Cancer Research in 1974  and Professor David Baltimore for the Whitehead Institute in 1982).A longtime resident of Concord  Massachusetts  Brown is survived by his children  James  Lindsey  and Holly  and his four grandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife  Shirley  and a brother  James.Gifts in Brown’s name may be made to theGene Brown Undergraduate Education Fund  fund No. 3839399. Donations in his memory will support undergraduates and undergraduate education in the MIT Department of Biology. For more information  contact Rebecca Chamberlain at 617-253-4729 orrchambe@mit.edu.
Carl Garland  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 87,Carl W. Garland  professor emeritus in the Department of Chemistry  died Tuesday  July 11  at the age of 87.“Carl was an influential and outstanding scientist  mentor  educator  and colleague ” said Professor Timothy Jamison  head of the Department of Chemistry  upon learning of Garland’s passing. “We continue to hold him in very high esteem and will remember him fondly.”Born on October 1  1929 in Bangor  Maine  Garland was a resident of Lexington  Massachusetts. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Rochester in 1950  and went on to receive his PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 1953. He joined the faculty at MIT later that year as an instructor in the Department of Chemistry. Garland was a professor of physical chemistry in the department for over 40 years  until his retirement in 1997.  His early teaching activity with former Professor David Shoemaker resulted in the laboratory textbook "Experiments in Physical Chemistry." Currently in its 8th edition with new co-authors  the text has been widely used across the country.Garland held visiting professor appointments across the globe  including the universities of Bordeaux  Paris  Rome  and Cambridge; Israel’s Ben Gurion University of the Negev; and Belgium’s Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. In addition  he served as a scientific editor of the journalsOptics and SpectroscopyandLiquid Crystals.He was an A.P. Sloan Fellow (1954-1960)  a Guggenheim Fellow (1963-1964)  and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.“Carl was part of a golden age of physical chemistry at MIT ” says Professor Robert Guy Griffin. Professor Emeritus John Deutch shares a similar sentiment. “He was part of the distinguished group of physical chemists at MIT: John Ross  John Waugh  Irwin Oppenheim  Jim Kinsey  and Bob Silbey  now all gone  who made the MIT the leading department in physical chemistry from the mid 1960s to the mid 1980s ” Deutch remembers. “A dedicated colleague  Carl did his share  and should not be forgotten.”Professor emeritus of chemistry Jeffrey Steinfeld has the unique distinction of remembering Garland in two capacities — first  as one of Garland’s students  and later  as a colleague. “In the early 1960s  all Course 5 majors were required to take a physical chemistry laboratory subject  which was taught by Professor Garland ” Steinfeld says. “I took this class  along with [Stanford University Professor Emeritus] Hans Andersen and the Koch twins  Dave and Billy. After I joined the chemistry faculty  Professor Garland — possibly impressed by my performance in his lab class — asked me to join him and Dave Shoemaker as a co-author in a new edition of their classic 'Experiments in Physical Chemistry'laboratory textbook.” Years later  when both Steinfeld and Garland had retired to emeritus status with the department  they remained in touch via a group fondly known as the “Old Faculty Club ” which would meet most Tuesdays in the Stata Center faculty dining area  and included fellow emeritus chemistry faculty Irwin Oppenheim  John Waugh  Robert Alberty  and Dietmar Seyferth."Carl will be remembered as a tremendously kind  gentle  and magnanimous colleague whose research and teaching exuded scholarship and excellence ” says Sylvia Ceyer  the J.C. Sheehan Professor and former department head.Garland’s early work (1953-1965) involved studying the infrared spectra of chemisorbed molecules in order to characterize the bonding and structure of surface species. Subsequent work (1965-1985) focused on order-disorder and critical phenomena in crystals and fluids. This involved mostly ultrasonic velocity and attenuation as a function of temperature down to 4 kelvins and pressure up to 10 kbar in order to characterize both static thermodynamic and dynamic relaxation behavior. Finally  he undertook extensive studies of second-order phase transitions in liquid crystals (1980-2010)  primarily high-resolution AC calorimetry work on the critical behavior in nematic and smectic systems. This work involved pure liquid crystals  binary mixtures of liquid crystals (LCs)  and dispersions of silica nanoparticles in LCs. The latter systems allowed one to characterize the effects of random fields on bulk critical behavior in several theoretically interesting universality classes.Robert Birgeneau  former MIT faculty member and dean of science  and current chancellor emeritus and professor of physics  materials science and engineering  and public policy at the University of California at Berkeley  remembers Garland as one of his “most cherished  long-time collaborators … both a close friend and one of the finest scientists that I have ever known.” In particular  Birgeneau recalls a collaboration in the late 1970s  wherein Garland  J. David Lister  and Birgeneau conducted a comprehensive study of the phase transition behavior of thermotropic liquid crystals. “We realized that by carrying out heat capacity  light scattering  and X-ray scattering studies on the same material and analyzing all of the data together  we could obtain a comprehensive and definitive picture of the fundamental physics characterizing these systems ” Birgeneau explains. “This led to a number of landmark papers. Carl was an ideal collaborator; he was an excellent experimentalist  he understood theory well and he thought deeply about the science. Equally importantly  he was generous and kind. I particularly admired his care for his own graduate students  and for mine as well.”Birgeneau considers his final scientific interaction with Garland among the very best. “After I had come to Berkeley  a former graduate student  Mehmet Ramazanaglu; a postdoc  Byron Freelon; and I extended some of the earlier work that Carl and I had done at MIT on smectic liquid crystals embedded in silica gels. The results were  on the one hand  quite complicated but  on the other hand  prospectively quite important. Given my responsibilities as chancellor  I simply did not have the time required to oversee this project. I literally called Carl out of retirement to help me with this research. He did this with great verve and enthusiasm … it was as if he had gone back in time 30 years. Because of Carl  the project was an incredible success  with the resultant paper enthusiastically praised by thePhysical Reviewreferees. ... His passing represents a great loss to us all.”Garland is survived by his wife of 62 years  Joan Garland  who remembers meeting her husband at the MIT Faculty Club. "I kibitzed on a bridge game [Carl] was playing with John Waugh  David Shoemaker  and Dan Leussing " she recalls. "We were the second couple to get married in the new MIT Chapel  and had our reception at the MIT Faculty Club."Garland also leaves a daughter  Leslie Garland  of Maynard  Massachusetts  as well as a son  Andrew Garland  his wife  Helene  and three grandchildren  Rachel  Justin  and Daniel of Wyckoff  New Jersey. In addition  he is survived by a brother  David Garland  of Minneapolis  Minnesotta. Funeral services will be private.

A.R. Gurney  acclaimed playwright  author  and longtime MIT professor  dies at 86,A.R. "Pete" Gurney Jr.  an internationally acclaimed playwright and author who served on the MIT faculty for 36 years  died June 13 at his home in New York City. He was 86.The author of such well-known plays as “The Middle Ages ” “The Dining Room ” and “The Cocktail Hour ” Gurney was named a finalist for the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play "Love Letters." His Broadway debut  in 1987  was with "Sweet Sue" starring Mary Tyler Moore. He was also the author of three novels. Acomplete list of Gurney's worksis available on his website.Gurney joined the faculty of the Department of Humanities — a predecessor to the MIT School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences (SHASS) — in 1960. He earned tenure in 1968  was promoted to full professor in 1972  and retired in 1996  moving to New York City to focus more completely on the theater.In 1994  MIT honored Gurney with theMcDermott Awardfor his contribution to the arts. Among many other honors and awards  he was named to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2006.Deborah Fitzgerald  the Cutten Professor of the History of Technology  and a former dean of SHASS  recalls Gurney as a "legend at the Institute. We have had many enormously distinguished faculty in SHASS over the years " she said  "and he was one of the most remarkable from the humanities and arts.""Gurney was a wonderful mentor to young faculty in the MIT Humanities and an outstanding teacher " says Philip Khoury  associate provost and the Ford International Professor of History. "His many students continue to remember him with fondness and appreciation. One of America’s leading playwrights  Pete Gurney was forever conscious of what MIT meant for his professional career. And he contributed enormously to making the MIT humanities so vital.”"I remember Gurney sitting in on an American literature class when I was an undergraduate at MIT " recalls Duane Boning  now the Clarence J. LeBel Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. "He wasn't the lecturer — Gurney was there out of love for the subject  and to hear what young students were thinking about these books. I thought that was pretty cool. Even when he wasn't teaching  he was inspiring."Inan extensive tributeto the life and works of A.R. Gurney The New York Timesreports on the driving force of his writing: “'What seems to obsess me ' he once said  'is the contrast between the world and the values I was immersed in when I was young  and the nature of the contemporary world.' Early on  he said  'I sensed the comforts of civilization — but also its discontents  what you give up. The emotions are carefully trained  ultimately honed  tamped down.' He devoted his life to bringing those feelings to the surface."Story prepared by MIT SHASS CommunicationsEditorial Director: Emily HiestandSenior Writer: Kathryn O'Neill
Robert Lees  cardiologist and former MIT professor  dies at 82 ,Physician and former MIT faculty member Robert S. Lees died on Monday  June 5  at the age of 82  after a lengthy struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. Lees had a long and distinguished career in academic medicine. He was a cardiologist on the staff of the Massachusetts General Hospital for 50 years  as well as a professor at MIT in the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology (HST). His devotion to his patients  and his remarkable skill at keeping them alive and happy for many years  were widely admired and appreciated. He made several valuable clinical and research discoveries  and was an advisor to students at MIT and HST.Lees was born on July 16  1934 in the Bronx  New York. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1955 where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa; he graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1959. He began his medical career as an intern in surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In July 1960  he married Ann Mirabile  a 1961 graduate of Harvard Medical School and a long-time research colleague. Also that year  he began a yearlong clinical and research fellowship in medicine in the newly opened arteriosclerosis unit at the MGH. There  he developed a practical method for improving the diagnosis of patients with high blood lipids  the first research achievement in his long career focusing on the causes  diagnosis  and treatment of arteriosclerosis  the thickening and hardening of the artery walls.In the following two years  he was an assistant resident in medicine at the MGH and then a fellow at the National Heart Hospital in London.From 1963 to 1966  Lees served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service at the National Heart Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland. There  he demonstrated the widespread value of the diagnostic tool he had developed at the MGH arteriosclerosis unit.From 1966 to 1968 he was an assistant professor at the Rockefeller University in New York City. While there  he treated two young women who each had a double dose of bad genes for high blood-cholesterol. Such patients are unable to respond to any standard treatments  and they ordinarily die from coronary artery disease in their teens or early twenties. Lees developed a novel treatment to remove the lethal cholesterol from the patients’ plasma. After six months of the treatment  a form of plasmapheresis  there was marked improvement in both patients. The experiment led to a machine that is still in use to extend productive lives for patients with dangerously high cholesterol who do not respond to drugs.When Lees became director of the MIT Clinical Research Center in 1969  he began treating two other patients who had a double dose of high blood-cholesterol genes. Treatment for one of them started when she was 16. She lived to her early 50s. The other patient  whom Lees first met when she was 3 years old  is still happily alive at the age of 51.Lees also collaborated with an MIT professor of mechanical engineering to develop a machine that analyzed the sound waves made by blocked carotid arteries  which are located in the neck and deliver blood to the brain. The noninvasive technique used a microphone placed on the neck that sent the sound of blood flow in a blocked artery to a computer that determined how narrow the artery had become. The technique was called phonoangiography. It could measure carotid arterial narrowing to within 1 millimeter.From 1973 to 1982  Lees was the first director of the Noninvasive Diagnostic Lab at MGH  where ultrasound was used to locate atherosclerotic plaques.Another long-standing project was finding a way to locate atherosclerotic lesions by using compounds with a short-lived radioactive label attached. A promising element of this work was the discovery of a previously unknown protein in the artery wall. The protein  christened atherin  binds low density lipoproteins  the carriers of blood cholesterol  so tightly in the artery wall that the binding is believed to lead to atherosclerotic plaques.From 1982 to 1991  Lees undertook clinical and research work at the New England Deaconess Hospital where he was director of medical research; after that  the work continued at the nonprofit Boston Heart Foundation in Cambridge  Massachusetts  an organization that Lees founded and directed from 1991 until retiring in December 2004.Lees was member of the MIT Premedical Advisory Council from 1969 to 2007. He was also a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Metabolism Study Section of the National Institutes of Health  which he chaired from 1978 to 1980  as well as several other committees at MIT and Harvard Medical School. He was a fellow of the American College of Cardiology and the Council on Arteriosclerosis of the American Heart Association. He co-founded two companies  Diatide  and Atherex. He had many scientific publications and patents.In addition to Ann Mirabile Lees  his wife of 56 years  Lees is survived by his sons  David and Steven; his daughters  Sarah and Martha; and five grandchildren.
Thomas McKrell  research scientist and mentor in nuclear science and engineering  dies at 47,Thomas J. McKrell  a research scientist in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE)  passed away on June 9 at the age of 47.An expert in materials behavior  especially corrosion of metallic alloys used in nuclear and conventional power plants  he came to MIT in 2006 after serving as a consultant in the power industry for more than a decade.During his time at MIT  McKrell focused primarily on nuclear engineering  in particular  thermal-hydraulics. He became a technical leader in the area of heat transfer enhancement through the use of nanofluids  on which he organized sessions and gave invited lectures at domestic and international conferences. In 2011 he was appointed to the editorial board of theJournal of Nanofluids.McKrell was a prolific contributor to a diverse range of other subjects  including the study of oxidation of accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) for nuclear reactors  the mitigation of tube fouling in geothermal power systems  and the probing of fundamental mechanisms in boiling heat transfer using advanced infra-red diagnostics. He also helped to advance the testing of cruciform rods for advanced nuclear power systems  the measurement of optical properties in molten salts for nuclear and solar applications  and the development of drag-reducing coatings for torpedoes.“Tom was one of the best people and scientists I met at MIT ” says MIT research scientist Bren Phillips. “His personal commitment and dedication was focused not only on the results of the research  but also on the personal growth of the individual students working with him. His colleagues all saw him as essential  both in terms of his scientific knowledge and for his daily enthusiasm and effort.”Notably  McKrell served as director of the Thermal Hydraulics and Materials in Extreme Environments Laboratory (known as the “Green Lab” to everyone in NSE)  within the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems  from May 2006 onward. He led the transformation of the lab into a flexible multiuse tool  supporting up to eight different simultaneous experiments — all carefully maintained and orchestrated to be safe and efficient.In addition to his research and leadership  McKrell was praised as a teacher and mentor of MIT students. He introduced dozens of graduate and undergraduate students to the challenges and joys of experimental work  offering advice on their experiments  including the design of new facilities  help with ordering parts  and interpretation of data.One student said he always looked forward “to going to the lab to work because of the friendly  fun  exciting  cooperative  and safe culture he has fostered in the laboratory.” Another student commented on the ways that McKrell remained influential even to those he no longer directly mentored  saying  “Tom continues to provide me with personal and professional insight that nurtures my progress even though I no longer work under his cognizance. I have … known no other research scientist to be as important and involved in student progress as Tom.”Such contributions did not go unnoticed by his colleagues in NSE  at MIT  and beyond. “Simply put  McKrell was an invaluable contributor to NSE’s successful experimental fission research program. His dedication helped advance NSE’s fission research and helped it to become the recognized program it is today ” says Jacopo Buongiorno  associate head of NSE.In anNSE profile about McKrellwritten in 2015  he admitted that while mentoring could often take over his days  he still found the time to explore his own research interests. As a child growing up in New Hampshire  McKrell said he noticed cars bellowing exhaust on the highway. “I could see the toll that people were having on the environment  and their disregard for nature. I always thought it would be great to make some sort of meaningful contribution  to have a huge positive impact on the environment in some way.” At MIT  he said  “I’ve been able to contribute to the clean energy sector more than that inquisitive child could have ever imagined.”McKrell’s love of nature  which began during his childhood years living in a rural area  never subsided. In his adult years  McKrell carved out time for lingering in the woods near his home. “I like to sit quietly and wait for animals  like deer  to come and bed for the night ” he said. “I’ve always had that connection with the environment.”McKrell is survived by his wife  Elizabeth  and two children  Grace and John. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held in the fall.
Arthur Kerman  professor emeritus of physics  dies at 88,Arthur K. Kerman  professor emeritus of physics and a distinguished international researcher in MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP) and Laboratory for Nuclear Science  passed away May 11 at the age of 88.He was known for his work on the theory of the structure of nuclei and on the theory of nuclear reactions.“He was a wonderful friend and colleague  accomplishing many important things in the creation and promotion of science ” says Professor Emeritus Earle Lomon of the CTP  and Kerman’s longtime friend. “We will greatly miss his friendship and guidance.”As Mike Campbell of the University of Rochester poetically says  “The world is a little more empty and quiet without Arthur in it.”Arthur Kent Kerman was born May 3  1929  in Montreal. He graduated in 1950 from McGill University  where he studied physics and mathematics. At MIT  under Victor Frederick Weisskopf  he completed his PhD in nuclear surface oscillations in 1953. From 1953 to 1954  he studied with R.F. Christy at Caltech under a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship  and in 1954 he began a two-year stay at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen.“With the presence of Niels Bohr  Aage Bohr  Ben Mottelson  and Willem V.R. Malkus  there were many physicists from Europe and elsewhere  including MIT’s Dave Frisch  making the Institute for Physics an exciting place to be ” recalls Lomon. Kerman’s close friend since the early 1940s  when they were Boy Scouts in Montreal  Lomon studied with Kerman at McGill  MIT  and Copenhagen.Kerman’s research included nuclear and high-energy physics  astrophysics  and the development of advanced particle detectors. His interests in theoretical nuclear physics included nuclear quantum chromodynamics-relativistic heavy-ion physics  nuclear reactions  and laser accelerators. He developed a set of nucleon-nucleon potentials  which were found to be useful for the study of nuclear matter and finite nuclei.Kerman published or co-published more than 100 papers. He wrote papers on the effects of the Coriolis interaction in rotational nuclei; quasi-spin; the application of the Hartree-Fock method to the calculation of the ground state properties of spherical and deformed nuclei; pairing correlations in nuclei; and the possible existence of transuranic islands of stability. In his research on reactions  his papers discussed the scattering of fast particles by nuclei. He also wrote papers on intermediate structure in nuclear reactions; on the properties of isobar analog states; and strangeness analog resonances. He was an early advocate of the importance of quarks for understanding nuclear physics. He developed a nucleon-nucleon potential with a soft core that fits nucleon-nucleon scattering data as well as potentials with a hard repulsive core do  which was found to be useful in the study of what is needed beyond scattering data to determine the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei.Kerman joined the MIT faculty in 1956 as an assistant professor of physics. In the summers of 1959 and 1960 he was a research associate at the Argonne National Laboratory  and during this period he also was a consultant to the Shell Development Company of Houston  and the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory. He also participated in the Physical Science Study Committee — a group of high school and university physics professors — to write a more accessible and engaging high school physics textbook. He was a consultant with Educational Services Inc. from 1959 to 1966  and collaborated in the quantum physics part of the experimental course Physics: A New Introductory Course (nicknamed PANIC)  produced by the Education Research Center at MIT. He became an associate professor in 1960  and the following year  he went on academic leave and was “professeur d’echange” at the University of Paris under a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. He became professor in 1964.In the early 1960s  Kerman traveled with physics professors Sheldon Glashow  then of the University of California at Berkeley and now of Boston University  and Charles Schwartz of Berkeley for a month-long visit as potential members to JASON  a scientific advisory group in Washington  sponsored by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy  among other government groups.“We were asked at the beginning of our particular interests ” recalls Glashow. “What they were getting at was whether we wanted ‘war’ work or ‘peace’ work. Everybody  except us three ‘lefties’ including Arthur  chose ‘war.’ Our ‘peaceful' challenge was to examine all available sources  whether classified or not  to assess the potential value of airborne or satellite surveillance of the Soviet Union and to produce a supposedly unclassified document. We did our work  and our document was promptly classified. We never heard back from JASON  nor did we care.”From 1976-1983  Kerman was the director of MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics  and from 1983 to 1992  he was director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. For many years  Kerman was a leading force in pushing for new initiatives in science. He had various longstanding consulting relationships with Argonne  Brookhaven  Knolls Atomic Power  Lawrence Berkeley  Lawrence Livermore  Los Alamos Scientific  and Oak Ridge national laboratories  and with the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST).Kermanadvised 43 students  from 1958 to 2006. Kerman officially retired from MIT after 47 years  and retained the title of professor emeritus from 1999 until his passing.He served on many influential bodies  including the Visiting Committees of Bartol Research Foundation  Princeton-Penn Accelerator  the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Inertial Confinement Fusion; National Ignition Facility Programs Review Committee at Livermore; Directorate and Division Review Committees at Livermore; the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider Policy Committee at Brookhaven; Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Scientific Policy Committee; Secretary of Energy Fusion Policy Advisory Committee; the White House Science Council Panel on Science and Technology; the Department of Energy’s Inertial Confinement Fusion Advisory Committee  and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center Advisory Board. At Los Alamos National Laboratory  he was on the Physics Division Advisory Committee and the Theory Advisory Committee. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  he served on the Director’s Advisory Committee  the Physics and Space Technology Advisory Committee  and as chair  the Director’s Review Committee for the Physics Directorate.Kerman was made a fellow of the American Physical Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the New York Academy of Sciences; he was named a Guggenheim Fellow in Natural Sciences. He was associate editor ofReviews of Modern Physics.Many describe Kerman as an outspoken advocate in his field. “He never hesitated  regardless of the consequences  to speak out and to support me when called upon in different circumstances to analyze programs that involved large-scale funding while lacking adequate justification ” says MIT  professor of physics Bruno Coppi  Kerman’s friend since the 1960s. “We both had to take a public stand  and time proved that our assessments were correct.”“He was  until the end  a valued advisor to different national laboratories and to the highest levels of the Department of Energy ” Coppi adds.In his presentation  “Three Decades of Interacting with Arthur Kerman ” Michael N. Kreisler  SAIC contractor to the National Nuclear Security Administration at the Department of Energy  and physics professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst  had spoken at the 2012 CERN International Conference on Nuclear Reaction Mechanisms about Kerman’s influence on policy within the scientific community: “Arthur either knows everyone of importance or had them as students. I continue to be amazed at his ability to get appointments with everyone in DOE or at the laboratories […] If you want something done  convince Arthur and he’ll be an influential advocate.”Kreisler added  “Whenever you work on an exciting new science project  Arthur is sure to tell you that he was involved in the very early stages of that project. While it sometimes seems impossible for him to have actually done as much as he says  I know from experience that it really is true.”However  Kerman was known for his calm  quiet style of leadership. “He had an extraordinary capacity to think on his feet  inspiring collaborators ” says Lomon. “Although  he had much less interest in writing papers  which was a source of some frustration to the same collaborators.”Kerman kept frequent contact with his friends and collaborators  despite his declining health. Kerman was coming regularly to weekly physics department lunches. “He delighted in reminiscing about the special atmosphere we had in our department during the times of the ‘Copenhagen Table ’” says Coppi  who met weekly with Kerman  up until a week before his passing away.After one of his stays in Europe  Kerman had brought back a large table that was kept within the Center for Theoretical Physics. “All active theorists and experimentalists  including Herman Feshbach  Felix Villars  and Martin Deutsch  interested in developments of theory in our department and outside  would gather around it ” Coppi recalls.“I always enjoyed and learned from our lively physics discussions ” recalls Professor John Negele. “His shared interest in high-performance computing and extensive contacts in DOE enabled us to obtain a supercomputer at MIT to study the role of quarks in nuclear physics from first principles.”Despite health problems in his later years  his commitment to physics and service to the country still saw him traveling all over the world  as well as back to campus  well into his 80s. Until several days before he died at age 88  he was working with Mark Mueller on a new theory of dark matter and energy.“In recent years Arthur was deeply concerned about the trends in funding and management of research  and of physics in particular  both at the national and international level ” says Coppi. “Arthur will be greatly missed at MIT  in our department  and in the international scientific community.”A long-time resident of Winchester  Massachusetts  Kerman was the husband of Enid Ehrlich for 64 years. He was extremely attached to and proud of his children. Eldest son Ben Kerman ’81  who is an MIT biology alumnus and physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital  lives in Hingham  Massachusetts. Dan is a mechanical engineer at the Federal Aviation Administration and lives in New Hampshire. Elizabeth is an architect and lives in San Francisco. Melissa has her own creative arts and crafts business and lives in Charlotte  North Carolina. Jaime got his PhD in physics from Stanford University  works at Lincoln Lab and lives in Arlington  Massachusetts. Arthur is also survived by 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.Gifts in Kerman’s name may be made to the Arthur Kerman Fellowship Fund  #3302540. Gifts will support fellowships in the Department of Physics  with a preference for fellows conducting research in theoretical physics.

T.W. “Bill” Lambe  professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering  dies at 96,T. William “Bill” Lambe  professor emeritus in civil and environmental engineering  passed away on March 6. He was 96 years old.Lambe SM ’44 PhD ’48 arrived at MIT to pursue graduate studies in civil engineering after a brief stint working in the engineering industry.As a graduate student in 1945  Lambe began working as an instructor at MIT. By July 1959  he was a full professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He held the first Edmund K. Turner Professor of Civil Engineering professorship from 1969 until his retirement from teaching in June 1981.Lambe’s research is remembered for having a close relation to engineering practice  reflective of his own career path. His academic contributions to geotechnical engineering were fundamental and far-reaching  and included research of soil chemistry  soil stabilization and freezing  the stress path method  and the formalizing of geotechnical prediction. Lambe’s predictions are one instance of the overlap between engineering practice and academia. His contributions as an academic were fundamental to geotechnical engineering.His textbooks  “Soil Testing for Engineers ” published in 1951  and “Soil Mechanics ” co-authored with Robert Whitman and published in 1969  were also groundbreaking in the field.Another example of Lambe’s ability to have research and practical engineering benefit from each other was the instrumentation of foundation work on multiple MIT buildings constructed during the building boom of the 1960’s and for Boston-area subway construction. MIT geotechnical students were educated to become engineers through practice-oriented research and direct or indirect involvement in Lambe’s consulting projects.Following his retirement from MIT  Lambe returned to the engineering industry  serving as a consultant on numerous international projects. These projects included landslides; earth dams for storage of oil  mining waster  and water; building foundations; foundations for an off-shore storm surge barrier; and hydraulic reclamation projects  among others. He remained active as a consultant until his early 90’s.Lambe was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)  a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers  an honorary member of the Southeast Asian Society of Geotechnical Engineering  and an honorary member of the Venezuelan Society of Soil mechanics and Foundation Engineering. His more than 100 publications earned him many awards including the ASCE’s highest award  the Norman Medal  in 1964; the ASCE Terzaghi Award in 1975; and the N.C. State University Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award in 1982.He is survived by five children: Philip and wife Catherine; Virginia and husband Robert Guaraldi; Richard and wife Michele; Robert and wife Judith; and Susan and husband Scott Clary  who live in North Carolina  New Hampshire  Washington  Massachusetts  and Virginia  respectively. His growing family includes 14 grandchildren and their six spouses  and seven great-grandchildren.
MIT Corporation life member and biotech pioneer Henri Termeer dies at 71,MIT Corporation life member and biotechnology pioneer Henri A. Termeer  who led the iconic Genzyme Corporation for nearly three decades  with a strong focus on combating rare diseases  died on Friday night at his home in Marblehead  Massachusetts. He was 71.Widely regarded as a founder of Boston’s biotech industry  Termeer joined a fledgling Genzyme in the early 1980s  when the biotech industry itself was still in its infancy. Serving as Genzyme’s chairman  president  and CEO from 1983 until 2011  Termeer nurtured the company from a startup with fewer than 20 employees into one of the world’s largest biotech companies  employing more than 12 500 people worldwide.At Genzyme  Termeer waged a therapeutic battle against rare genetic diseases that had few  if any  effective treatments available. Under his leadership  Genzyme developed a group of rare-disease medicines that have now reached thousands of patients — including the enzyme-replacement drugs Cerezyme for Gaucher disease and Fabrazyme for Fabry disease  as well as Lemtrada  a multiple sclerosis drug. Consequently  Termeer rose to prominence as an innovator of rare-disease drugs (called “orphan drugs”)  which is fast becoming a lucrative market.In 2011  Genzyme sold to French drug giant Sanofi SA for more than $20 billion — the second-largest acquisition deal in the history of the biotech industry  thanks largely to Termeer’s vision and business acumen.In 2006  Termeer joined the MIT Corporation — the Institute’s board of trustees — as a term member  and was re-elected in 2011. In 2013  Termeer was named an MIT Corporation life member.“Henri Termeer was a gentleman — and a giant ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. “Brilliantly creative  wise  charming  gracious  and brave  he showed us all  in everything he did  how to live and how to lead. At Genzyme  by developing treatments for patients struggling with rare diseases  he built a thriving company  created thousands of jobs  and offered hope and health to countless individuals who otherwise had neither. In the process  he helped launch the biotechnology revolution in Greater Boston. And he built a parallel career as one of the region’s leading citizens  offering his insight and vision to help guide many of our most important institutions.”“At MIT alone ” Reif continues  “he was a life member of the MIT Corporation and served on its Executive Committee; he chaired its Risk and Audit Committee; and he was crucial to shaping the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science. We will miss Henri terribly — as an advisor  an inspiration  and a friend. Our hearts go out to his wife  Belinda  to all the Termeers  and to the broader Genzyme family.”“Henri was an extraordinarily wise man who gave MIT the wisdom of his experience  judgement  and perspective  such that the Institute could better serve its mission ” MIT Corporation Chair Robert B. Millard ’73 says. “He tangibly guided and amplified the work of MIT. He was one of the most respected and admired people we had the honor of knowing.”Termeer’s impact on the local and global biotech industry was enormous. Scores of biotech leaders from around the world considered Termeer a mentor. In numerous articles published online about Termeer’s passing over the weekend  a number of those leaders mourned the loss of their former friend  praising Termeer as a mentor and biotech pioneer  and noting his magnetism and warmth as a business leader.In aBoston Business Journalstory  Josh Boger  founding CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals  called Termeer an “example for how to run a biotech firm” as a human- and community-centric organization: “I really was tutored by Henri Termeer about how [being a biotech CEO] is not just something that’s added to who you are. ... He was such a wonderful advocate for the patients  and an advocate for the industry he was a part of.”Echoing that sentiment was David Meeker  now president of Sanofi Genzyme  in anarticleabout Termeer inThe Boston Globe. Termeer  Meeker told theGlobe  was “the dean of the biotech community.” “His vision was to cure rare diseases  and he always had time to meet with the people dependent on our treatments ” he said. “He had the ability to forge such an intense relationship with everyone he met  and he made everyone in the industry feel like he cared about them as an individual.”Many also attribute the rise of the Boston and Massachusetts biotech scene to Termeer’s work at Genzyme. In theGlobearticle  Bob Coughlin  president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council  called Termeer “a true visionary and an exemplary leader ” noting that Termeer and Genzyme had helped mold Massachusetts “into the best biotech hub in the world.”After leaving Genzyme  Termeer stayed active in the biotech industry and never lost his love of launching and building companies. In 2011  Termeer and his wife  Belinda  donated $10 million to launch the Henri and Belinda Termeer Center for Targeted Therapies at Massachusetts General Hospital  where he served on the board of trustees. The center is designing a fast-growing pipeline of targeted treatments for rare tumors that have had few effective treatments.Until his passing  Termeer also served on the boards of directors of several biotech companies  including X4 Pharmaceuticals  ProQR Therpeutics  and Lysosomal Therapeutics  all of which he co-founded  as well as Moderna Therapeutics  Verastem  Aveo Oncology  and others.Termeer was also a board member for Partners Health Care  Harvard Medical School  Project HOPE  the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  and the Biotechnology Industry Organization  the world’s largest biotech trade association that he helped launch. Termeer also helped launch the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation  a Cambridge-based nonpartisan national health policy institute. From 2007 to 2011  Termeer served as a member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and as chairman from 2010 to 2011.Born in the Netherlands in 1946  Termeer studied economics at the Economische Hogeschool  Erasmus University. In 1973  he earned his MBA at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia  and started working for Baxter International  a medical device company in Deerfield  Illinois  where he quickly climbed the ranks. From 1976 to 1979  he served as general manager for Travenol GmbH in Munich  Germany  and then as vice president of the Hyland Therapeutics division of Baxter Travenol in Glendale  California  from 1979 to 1981.In 1983  Termeer was named president of a relatively unknown two-year-old biotech startup  Genzyme  located in Boston’s Chinatown  then called the “Combat Zone” — a former red-light district that Termeer had wryly described once as “the most romantic of neighborhoods.” Coincidentally  that year saw the passing of the Orphan Drug Act  a U.S. law that facilitated the development of drugs to treat rare diseases — such as Huntington’s Disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and muscular dystrophy — that then had limited treatment options.In 1985  Termeer was appointed as Genzyme CEO and  in 1988  was named as chairman. By its 2011 acquisition  Genzyme  with Termeer at the helm  had become the third largest company of its kind  with more than 12 500 employees spanning more than 70 offices and plants worldwide. Much of the company’s value has been credited to Termeer’s leadership and focus on developing orphan drugs with unique biochemical designs to fight rare diseases. The National Organization for Rare Disorders estimates that 30 million Americans suffer from 7 000 rare diseases. In recent years  experts have projected that the steady-growing global orphan drug market will reach anywhere from $150 billion to $200 billion by 2020.In a 2011 Boston.comarticle  Termeer fondly recalled his fateful first introduction to Genzyme nearly three decades prior — an unassuming company with infinite promise: “One day I got a call to visit whatever it was at Genzyme. And it was  of course  not much. It had the right ingredients. I liked that the direction hadn’t been really established. It was an open book. I could go where I wanted to go. I gave up my job  gave up half my income  and moved here. It was a shot in the dark  and it was magnificent.”Termeer’s survivors include his wife  Belinda  and their daughter  Adriana  of Marblehead; his son  Nicholas  who lives in England; two sisters  Ineke of France and Marlies Verduijn of the Netherlands; and three brothers  Bert  Paul  Roel  all of the Netherlands.A celebration of Termeer’s life will be held on Saturday  May 20  at 11 a.m. in Kresge Auditorium. Parking is available in the West Garage on Vassar Street.
Anthony French  professor emeritus of physics  dies at 96,Anthony “Tony” Philip French  MIT professor emeritus in physics and a notable leader in physics education  died on Feb. 3. He was 96 years old.French was born and educated in Great Britain. After finishing his undergraduate work in 1942  he assisted in the nuclear bomb projects in England and Los Alamos. After the war he completed his graduate work in nuclear physics and became a faculty member at Cambridge University. In 1955 he took a faculty position at the University of South Carolina and shortly later became chair of its physics department. In 1962  he moved to MIT where he developed a new curriculum for introductory physics. In the 1970s as associate chair of physics he managed and led the teaching of MIT's large introductory physics course and wrote four of the MIT Introductory Physics series of textbooks. He also played a role in physics education beyond MIT. From 1975 to 1981 he was chairman of the Commission on Physics Education of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics  and from 1983 to 1986 he was successively vice president  president-elect  president  and past president of the American Association of Physics Teachers. He retired from MIT in 1991 but remained active in the community of physics educators. In 1993 he chaired the committee that set the examinations for the XXIV International Physics Olympiad.French was born Nov. 20  1920  in Brighton  England. The son of a printer  French earned a scholarship to Sydney Sussex College at Cambridge University  following an early interest in science  especially classical mechanics. He was particularly interested in lectures by Egon Bretscher  a Swiss physicist at Cambridge  who steered French toward nuclear physics.After receiving a BA in physics in 1942  French was recruited by Bretscher into the Tube Alloys Project  Britain's code name for its atomic bomb research. French's job was helping Bretscher measure fast neutron cross-sections  information needed to design a bomb. In 1944  the British effort was merged with the American Manhattan Project  and Tony was sent with the British mission to Los Alamos. “He was 23  barely educated in physics  and suddenly removed from grim wartime Britain to a land of sunshine where you could have oranges and eggs (in Britain the ration was one egg per week) and set down in the mountains of New Mexico with some of the best and most famous physicists in the world ” says Professor Charles H. Holbrow  Colgate University emeritus professor of physics and frequent visitor to MIT. “It was exciting.”French worked in a group led by physicist Edward Teller  who wanted to develop what would eventually become the hydrogen bomb  the so-called "Super." Teller would not work on the fission bomb project after he was refused leadership of the project's theory group  so he was given a small group to study the Super. Bretscher and French worked in Teller's small group  and French measured reactions of light nuclei such as d + d --> p + 3H and d + 3H --> n + 4He.After the war ended  French married Naomi Livesay  a mathematician from Montana who had worked in Richard Feynman's computation group at Los Alamos. They spent their honeymoon driving around the American Northwest in a car they bought from fellow Los Alamos researcher and  later  convicted atomic spy  Klaus Fuchs.In 1946  they moved to Cambridge University in England  where  as a fellow and director of studies in Natural Sciences at Pembroke College  French became a faculty member and earned his doctorate in nuclear physics using declassified results from his work at Los Alamos. French also worked briefly at the new Atomic Energy Research Establishment  known as AERE or  colloquially  Harwell.In 1955 French emigrated to the United States to teach at theUniversity of South Carolina. A few months after he arrived  he was appointed the new chair when the physics department chairman died. For the next six years  French led the department's vigorous development of research and teaching  and created and taught a course in modern physics. He also wrote his textbook "Principles of Modern Physics."French was working in the golden age of science education reform. Many critics were calling for a return to fundamentals  “drill and memorization ” but with the launch of Sputnik  the American public demanded higher academic standards in math and science.In 1956  MIT physics professor Jerrold Zacharias  with support from the National Science Foundation  formed PSSC  the Physical Science Study Committee  a large-scale effort to improve the content and teaching of high school physics. Zacharias and fellow professor Francis Friedman were impressed by French’s physics book and in 1960 invited French to MIT to attend a one-week PSSC workshop.The workshop was run by Zacharias  Patterson Hume  Donald Ivey  and Eric Rogers. One of French’s favorite experiments from the class was the soda-straw balance  which measured milligrams or less with materials costing no more than a few cents.In his essay “50 Years Later: Discovering the PSSC: A Personal Memoir ” French declared that the “PSSC had enormous impact on physics teaching  not just in high school but at all levels  and not just in America  but all over the world.”French took what he learned at MIT and introduced PSSC to South Carolina physics teachers. However  he later noted his frustration with the limitations of PSSC teaching: The Saturday course lasted a whole academic year but didn’t offer academic credit  for one thing. “Some of my participants were probably better off teaching a traditional course that better matched their own limitations ” he recalled. “But there is little doubt in my mind that these conferences played an indispensable role in ensuring that the PSSC program  as it became more and more widely used  would nevertheless preserve its freshness and its distinctive character.”After being recruited by Zacharias to the MIT physics faculty in 1962  French played a large role in the required introductory physics courses at MIT. When French asked Physics Chairman Bill Buechner to add more students to his small experimental physics course  Buechner replied  "That's of no use to me. Take the whole freshman class." So  French began teaching introductory mechanics to hundreds of freshmen."I wanted to be cautious about giving it a name ” said French. “So I called it  blandly  ‘Physics: A New Introductory Course.’ I couldn't imagine how I could have been so stupid. The students read that as ‘PANIC’ … it was known forever afterwards as the PANIC course!”In 1970  French was appointed associate chair  and through the 1970s and 1980s he managed the introductory physics courses  taught in them  and wrote his MIT "Introductory Physics Series" books. Today  his books on relativity and waves are still being used.Professor Edwin F. Taylor recalled French’s style of teaching as lecture-based  and that he put a great deal of effort into preparing what he would say in class.“Think of Lecture Hall 26-100 full twice a day for just physics  watching a demonstration lecture where each basic idea was shown with a set of by-then well-developed standard demonstrations carried out by the lecturer  with a phalanx of professional assistants setting up each one  and working with professionals to develop new ones. Tony French gave most of the monster lectures in 26-100 to HUGE audiences.”A bit of an introvert  French was “wonderful with words  deeply literate  historically competent ” says Taylor. Added Holbrow  “He was not known as a colorful or flamboyant lecturer. He strove to be lucid and  above all  correct. A number of his publications straighten out kinks that have grown into traditional presentations of physics  correcting myths or dispensing with shortcuts that are bad physics.”"He had a sense of humor " says Holbrow  “and in the 1960s he had a bout of enthusiasm for writing Clerihews (double-dactyls). For example:Higglety piggletyRobert A. MillikanScrutinized oil dropsAnd so measured e;Studied phenomenaPhotoelectrical Won the Nobel Prize andSaid 'Look at ME!'(For more of French's clerihews  see page 128 of Robert L. Weber (ed.) "More Random Walks in Science "The Institute of Physics  Adam Hilger  Ltd.  Bristol  1982)French worked with Taylor in 1978 to write "An Introduction to Quantum Physics." “A unique feature of our quantum book was the use of photon polarization states as example of pure  mixed  entangled  and all such features of quantum physics now so central in the news ” recalled Taylor. “We handed out to students little kits that included cleaved calcite crystals  about a centimeter in dimension that separated any incoming light beam into perpendicularly linearly polarized quantum states. This would work for a flood of photons or one photon per hour. In the kit also was a so-called quarter-wave plate (which as I remember converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light)  tiny Polaroid linear polarizing sheets. When we all wrote the quantum book  many of our described atomic experiments were Thought Experiments  but now can be carried out in practice.”French said that his focus more on teaching rather than research made him a bit of an “oddball” at MIT. He was grateful to Zacharias for his view that the lecturer in physics was as important as the researcher. French advocated having introductory physics concentrate less on content and more on process; it should show students how physicists think. He was an effective user of demonstrations  and enjoyed devising new ones. These demonstrations won him recognition and were the basis for several publications in theAmerican Journal of Physics.He also collaborated with Philip Morrison and John King  two other innovative MIT physics teachers. “The good synergy among these three helped MIT physics teaching evolve toward what it has become today ” says Holbrow.French was recognized for his participation in international efforts to improve physics teaching  for editing "Einstein: A Centenary Volume" (1979) and for co-editing "Niels Bohr: A Centenary Volume" (1985). In 1976  he received a Distinguished Service Citation from AAPT. In 1980  he was awarded the University Medal of the Charles University  Prague  for contributions to physics education  and in 1988  the Bragg Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics (London) for contributions to the teaching of physics. In 1989  AAPT awarded him the Hans Christian Oersted Medal in recognition of his notable contributions to the teaching of physics  and in 1993 its Melba Newell Phillips Award for "his creative leadership  for his dedicated service  and for his exceptional contributions to physics education."French lived in Cambridge  Massachusetts. His first wife  Naomi (Livesay) French  died in 2001. In 2002 he married Dorothy Jensen-French  and is survived by her. He is also survived by his children Martin French and Gillian Peck; by his step-children Peter  Christine  Katheryn and Lisa; and by his granddaughter Sara French.
Ernesto Blanco  mechanical design professor and inventor of the stair-climbing wheelchair  dies at 94,Ernesto E. Blanco  a renown inventor  mechanical designer  and beloved former professor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE)  passed away on March 21  in Murrieta  California. He was 94 years old.Over the span of a half-century  Blanco designed a number of groundbreaking devices that aided the handicapped — including the first stair-climbing wheelchair and an improved Braille typewriter.Born in pre-revolutionary Cuba  Blancobegan his careeras chief draftsman of Havana's city planning department. In 1949  he left for the United States  where he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Blanco briefly returned to Havana to lead the University of Villanueva’s mechanical engineering department. In 1960  after the Cuban Revolution  Blanco left every item he owned behind and fled to the United States under the guise of a vacation to visit his American-born wife’s family.Within a week of arriving in the U.S.  Blanco was offered an assistant professor position at MIT. In 1964  he temporarily left MIT and accepted a role on the faculty at Tufts University. Blanco then took a five-year hiatus from academia  acting as a textile technology consultant before founding his own company in 1974. However  it wasn’t long before he was back in lecture halls. He was invited by Professor Robert Mann to join MechE at MIT as an adjunct full professor in the Design Division in 1977.During his nearly 38 years at MIT  Blanco developed a reputation as a consummate educator who treated every student  faculty  and staff member with the utmost care and respect. He emphasized creativity and analytical rigor in his courses. His compassion and consideration for everyone he encountered  along with his sartorial choices  earned him the affectionate title as “the man in the white lab coat.”While teaching and inspiring new generations of engineers  Blanco continued to invent devices that improved the quality of life for the physically impaired. In addition to his stair-climbing wheelchair and Braille display  Blanco invented trocars for endoscopic procedures and ophthalmological surgical tools. Blanco demonstrated his forward thinking nature by helping to develop aninteractive online programthat captured mechanical design processes for future students. He also found time for fun in his work  co-inventing a pancake flipping robot.In 2002  during the final competition for MechE’s 2.007 (Design and Manufacturing) course  Blanco was honored for aquarter century of engagementwith the class. After his retirement in 2007  he remained a regular attendee at the 2.007 and 2.009 (Product Engineering Processes) final presentations. He eventually moved to Temecula  California  where he could frequently be found in his home workshop or mentoring a local school’s robotics program.Blanco is survived by son Ricardo and his wife Ana  son René  sister Dinorah  and beloved grandchildren  nieces  and nephews. He was preceded by his wife of 54 years Sonia  who passed away in 2007.
James Mar  former AeroAstro department head and Air Force chief scientist  dies at 96,James W. Mar  a former head of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro)  and a chief scientist of the U.S. Air Force  passed away in Seattle  Washington  on March 4. He was 96.Known for his work on aircraft and spacecraft designs  Mar’s special interests were in the disciplines of structures  aeroelasticity  and materials.Mar retired as MIT’s Jerome C. Hunsaker Professor of Aerospace Education in July 1990. His MIT career  which spanned 41 years  included a 1981-1983 term as head of AeroAstro  and service as chair of numerous faculty committees including the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid  Committee on Engineering Education  the Athletic Board  and the Independent Activities Period.Mar’s research focused on advanced filamentary composite materials and large structures in space. He headed the AeroAstro Division of Structures  Materials  and Aeroelasticity. Mar founded and directed both the Technology Laboratory for Advanced Composites  and  with Professor Rene Miller  the Space Systems Laboratory. Mar was instrumental in creating the Unified Engineering subjects  which formed the foundation of AeroAstro’s undergraduate education.Following his retirement  Mar remained active in the aerospace field including serving as a member of NASA’s Space Systems and Technology Advisory Committee and of the Air Force Studies Board  and chairing the FAA’s Technical Oversight Group for Aging Aircraft.Over the years  Mar took on numerous advisory assignments including panels examining development of Air Force and Navy jet engines  and the operation of the Air Force Logistic Command and the Military Airlift Command. Between 1970 and 1972  he took leave from MIT to serve as the U.S. Air Force Chief Scientist. He chaired a committee reporting to the NASA Associate Administrator Office of Space Flight on the design of the graphite/epoxy filament-wound solid rocket motor  and was vice-chairman of the National Academy of Engineering panel that provided oversight of the Space Shuttle’s solid rocket booster redesign following the 1986 Challenger disaster.Originally from Oakland  California  Mar received his BS  MS  and ScD from MIT  all in civil engineering  in 1941  1947  and 1949  respectively. Between 1941 and 1944 he was employed by Curtiss-Wright as an aeronautical engineer. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1944 until 1946.AeroAstro Professor Paul A. Lagace  who began his MIT aeronautical education as one of Mar’s students and eventually became a faculty colleague  said  “Jim Mar was an outstanding person in many ways  making significant contributions to aerospace engineering  to the Institute  and to the aeronautics and astronautics department. But most importantly  he sincerely cared for  and helped  each student with whom he worked. I wouldn’t be where I am today without all he did for  and with  me.”As an MIT undergraduate in the late 1950s  Institute Professor Sheila Widnall was a Mar advisee. “Jim was a giant in the field. His expertise and his passion really shaped the AeroAstro department ” she said. She recalled a semi-serious hurdle that Mar suggested the department should place before faculty candidates  which became known as the Jim Mar Test. “Jim would say that if an airplane flew over and the candidate didn’t look up  that candidate didn’t belong in our department.”
Professor Stephen Ross  inventor of arbitrage pricing theory  dies at 73,MIT Sloan School of Management Professor Stephen Ross  inventor of the arbitrage pricing theory and a foundational member of the practice of modern finance  died Friday  March 3. He was 73.Ross  the Franco Modigliani Professor of Financial Economics  was best known for his arbitrage pricing theory  developed in 1976. The theory  commonly known as APT  is used to identify and exploit mispriced assets by tracking a number of macroeconomic factors. It serves as a framework for analyzing risks and returns. The APT is widely applied in investment management practice today. Ross is also responsible for theeconomic theory of agencyand was the co-creator of theCox-Ingersoll-Ross modelof pricing government bonds and thebinomial model for pricing options.Those theories and models are cornerstones of neoclassical finance  a field which Ross pioneered anddefended in a 2004 book of the same name. MIT Sloan Professor Leonid Kogan  a former student  co-authored the behavioral economics-based “The Price Impact and Survival of Irrational Traders” with Ross in 2006.“Steve was a scholar. If the model tells you otherwise and the results go against his beliefs  he updates his beliefs ” Kogan said. “His main position wasn’t dogmatic. He was trying to get to the truth.”More recently  Ross developed therecovery theorem  which allows the separation of probability distribution and risk aversion to forecast returns from state prices. His most recent research “focused on applying the recovery theorem to existing option pricing data  extending the recovery approach to fixed income markets  and using options to improve the performance of institutional portfolios ” according to his biography on MIT Sloan’s website.“Steve Ross will be remembered as an intellectual giant ” MIT Sloan Dean David Schmittlein wrote in a message to the MIT Sloan community. “What is known today about the science of finance and its application owes much to Steve’s pioneering work  ranging from asset pricing to investment management and to corporate finance. Steve did not believe in narrow specialization and intellectual boundaries. It is difficult to imagine the discipline of modern finance without Steve’s contributions.”“Steve Ross was one of the giants of modern finance with a razor sharp intellect and a heart of gold ” said MIT Sloan Professor Andrew Lo. “The cold  hard logic of his mathematical theories stood in sharp contrast to the warmth of his personality. He was more humanist than financial economist  and was deeply connected in so many communities that would rightly claim Steve as their own. This is an enormous loss to MIT and the world.”A bias for practical researchMIT’s motto  "mens et manus " or mind and hand  emphasizes both scientific thought and the development of its practical applications. As one of the founders of modern finance  Ross was a perfect fit for the MIT culture  said MIT Sloan professor and Nobel laureate Robert Merton.“What’s very unusual about finance — and Steve exemplified it — is the most sophisticated models  the theories  the empirical work … get accepted quite rapidly into the mainstream of practice ” Merton said. “The binomial model literally is used millions of times a day.”“Steve was a very quantitative guy and very theoretical  but he also had a strong practical streak in the sense that he really liked to see this stuff get used ” Merton said.In Stephen Ross Prize  recognition of a storied careerIn 2006  a group of Ross’ former students began to secretly raise funds amongst themselves to establish the Stephen A. Ross Prize in Financial Economics  to recognize published research that “exemplifies Steve’s research style and values.” The group raised more than $600 000  surpassing an initial $250 000 goal  and established the Foundation for the Advancement of Research in Financial Economics to award the prize. The prize has since been granted four times between 2008 and 2015.Merton said the prize’s growing prestige is a testament to Ross’ following  including his list of PhD students  a who’s who of a generation of finance researchers and practitioners. Kogan described the cohort of students advised by Ross as “unmatched in our profession.” Ross  Kogan said  was a cheerleader for his students  giving them space and support to nurture ideas that other advisers may have rejected.Ross received a bachelor’s degree from Caltech in 1965 and a PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1970. He served on the faculties at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and at Yale University before joining MIT Sloan  first as the Fischer Black Visiting Professor in 1997  then as a professor in 1998. His career was marked by many significant awards  most recently the2015 Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economicsand the2012 Onassis Prize for Finance. He was the 1996 International Association for Quantitative Finance Financial Engineer of the Year and won the 2007 Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize.In the private sector  Ross founded a series of asset management firms  including Roll and Ross Asset Management  and was more recently the co-founder of Ross  Jeffrey and Antle LLC  a Connecticut institutional investment firm. In 1988  he was president of the American Finance Association. He advised government agencies and had served as a director at Freddie Mac  CREF  and elsewhere.A more complete list of Ross’ awards and affiliations is available on hisMIT Sloan faculty directory page.High standards and a reputation for kindnessMerton remembered Ross as a connoisseur of fine wine and cuisine who was an amiable companion and colleague  even as he accepted nothing but the best in his work.“I’m going to miss his smile ” Merton said. “He could be a very tough guy. He had high standards and he made no bones about expressing them. But he also had a nice way about him.”MIT Sloan Professor Jiang Wang concurred  saying Ross conducted himself in an “artful” manner  both professionally and in personal encounters.“The other thing I found very inspiring about him is that he was always very positive  very optimistic  not just about research  but about other people ” Wang said. “And yet he didn’t compromise a bit when it came to intellectual pursuits.”Ross is survived by his wife  Carol  two children  and two granddaughters. Plans for services and a celebration of his life by MIT Sloan are forthcoming.
Institute Professor Emerita Mildred Dresselhaus  a pioneer in the electronic properties of materials  dies at 86,Mildred S. Dresselhaus  a celebrated and beloved MIT professor whose research helped unlock the mysteries of carbon  the most fundamental of organic elements — earning her the nickname “queen of carbon science” — died Monday at age 86.Dresselhaus  a solid-state physicist who was Institute Professor Emerita of Physics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  was also nationally known for her work to develop wider opportunities for women in science and engineering. She died at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge  Massachusetts  following a brief period of poor health.“Yesterday  we lost a giant — an exceptionally creative scientist and engineer who was also a delightful human being ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in an email today sharing the news of Dresselhaus’s death with the MIT community. “Among her many ‘firsts ’ in 1968  Millie became the first woman at MIT to attain the rank of full  tenured professor. She was the first solo recipient of a Kavli Prize and the first woman to win the National Medal of Science in Engineering.”“Millie was also  to my great good fortune  the first to reveal to me the wonderful spirit of MIT ” Reif added. “In fact  her down-to-earth demeanor was a major reason I decided to join this community. … Like dozens of young faculty and hundreds of MIT students over the years  I was lucky to count Millie as my mentor.”A winner of both thePresidential Medal of Freedom(from President Barack Obama  in 2014) and the National Medal of Science (from President George H.W. Bush  in 1990)  Dresselhaus was a member of the MIT faculty for 50 years. Beyond campus  she held a variety of posts that placed her at the pinnacle of the nation’s scientific enterprise.Dresselhaus’s research made fundamental discoveries in the electronic structure of semi-metals. She studied various aspects of graphite and authored a comprehensive book on fullerenes  also known as “buckyballs.” She was particularly well known for her work on nanomaterials and other nanostructural systems based on layered materials  like graphene  and more recently beyond graphene  like transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene. Her work on using quantum structures to improve thermoelectric energy conversion reignited this research field.
Bertram Kostant  professor emeritus of mathematics  dies at 88,Bertram Kostant  professor emeritus of mathematics at MIT  died at the Hebrew Senior Rehabilitation Center in Roslindale  Massachusetts  on Thursday  Feb. 2  at the age of 88.Kostant was a professor of mathematics at MIT from 1962 until 1993  when he officially retired  but he continued his active life in research  traveling and lecturing at various universities and conferences around the world.His legacy spans six decades and 107 published papers  and his ability to connect seemingly diverse ideas led to remarkable results that formed the cornerstone of rich and fruitful theories both in mathematics and theoretical physics. He held a deep passion for truth  for understanding  and for beauty; and an unshakeable faith that these things are woven together.Bertram Kostant was born on May 24  1928 in Brooklyn  New York. He graduated from Peter Stuyvesant High School in 1945. After studying chemical engineering for two years at Purdue University  he switched to mathematics  having fallen in love with the subject in the classes of Arthur Rosenthal and Michael Golomb  who were recent immigrants from Germany. In 1950 he earned a bachelor's degree with distinction in mathematics.Kostant was awarded an Atomic Energy Commission Fellowship for graduate studies at the University of Chicago. There  he found a stimulating environment. Influences on him included Marshall Stone  Adrian Albert  Shing Shen Chern  Paul Halmos  Irving Kaplansky  Irving Segal. Through Andre Weil  Kostant was exposed to the ideas of the Bourbaki group in thinking about and writing down mathematics. Edwin Spanier’s course on Lie groups used Chevalley’s text. He often said  “the sheer beauty of it all resonated with me.” This was the beginning of his lifelong passion for Lie groups — the continuous families of symmetries at the core of great parts of geometry  mathematical physics  and even algebra. His work ultimately touched almost every corner of Lie theory: algebraic groups and invariant theory  the geometry of homogeneous spaces  representation theory  geometric quantization and symplectic geometry  Lie algebra cohomology  Hamiltonian mechanics  and much more.Kostant received an MS in mathematics in 1951  and under Irving Segal  his PhD in 1954  with a thesis titled  “Representations of a Lie algebra and its enveloping algebra on a Hilbert space.”Between 1953 and 1956 Kostant was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1955-56 he was a Higgins Lecturer at Princeton University  where he investigated the “holonomy groups” arising in differential geometry and worked deepen our understanding of the structure of the so-called "simple" Lie algebras.From 1956 to 1962  Kostant was a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley  becoming a full professor in 1962. He was a member of the Miller Institute for Basic Research from 1958 to 1959.In 1962 Kostant joined the faculty at MIT  where he remained for the rest of his career. He was devoted to his weekly seminars in Lie theory. Over the years he supervised more than 20 PhD students — among them  the differential geometer James Simons — and served as a mentor to many postdocs and young faculty members. He worked with great energy and success to build MIT’s faculty in Lie theory and representation theory.In the early 1960s  Kostant began to develop his “method of coadjoint orbits” and “geometric quantization” relating symplectic geometry to infinite-dimensional representation theory. Geometric quantization provides a way to pass between the geometric pictures of Hamiltonian mechanics and the Hilbert spaces of quantum mechanics. His ideas have been at the heart of several very different mathematical disciplines ever since.Again and again  Kostant was able to make powerful use of the relationships he found between deep and subtle mathematics and much simpler ideas. For example  in the early 1960s he proved a purely algebraic result about “tridiagonal” matrices. In the 1970s  he used that result and the ideas of geometric quantization to study Whittaker models (which are at the heart of the theory of automorphic forms) and the Toda lattice (a widely studied model for one-dimensional crystals).Kostant received many awards and honors. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1959-60 (in Paris)  and a Sloan Fellow in 1961-63. In 1962 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and in 1978 to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1982 he was a fellow of the Sackler Institute for Advanced Studies at Tel Aviv University. In 1990 he was awarded the Steele Prize of the American Mathematical Society  in recognition of his 1975 paper  “On the existence and irreducibility of certain series of representations.”In 2001  Kostant was a Chern Lecturer and Chern Visiting Professor at Berkeley. He received honorary degrees from the University of Córdoba in Argentina in 1989  the University of Salamanca in Spain in 1992  and Purdue University in 1997. The latter  from his alma mater  was an honorary Doctor of Science degree  citing his fundamental contributions to mathematics and the inspiration he and his work provided to generations of researchers.In May 2008  the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences hosted a conference: “Lie Theory and Geometry: the Mathematical Legacy of Bertram Kostant ” at the University of British Columbia  celebrating the life and work of Kostant in his 80th year. In 2012  he was elected to the inaugural class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society. Last June  Kostant traveled to Rio de Janeiro for the Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics  where he received the prestigious Wigner Medal  “for his fundamental contributions to representation theory that led to new branches of mathematics and physics.”Kostant is survived by his wife  Ann  of 49 years; daughter Abbe Kostant Smerling of Lexington  Massachusetts; son Steven Kostant of Chevy Chase  Maryland; daughter Elizabeth Loew of Stoughton  Massachusetts; son David Amiel of Glendale  California; daughter Shoshanna Kostant of Boston  Massachusetts; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.A memorial will be held at MIT in late May. Further information will be posted on theMIT Department of Mathematics website.
Walter Morrow  pioneering electrical engineer and former MIT Lincoln Laboratory director  dies at 88,Walter E. Morrow  a pioneering electrical engineer and the director of MIT Lincoln Laboratory from April 1977 to June 1998  passed away on Sunday  Feb. 12  at his home in Weston  Massachusetts. He was 88 years old.Morrow ’49  SM ’51 began his career at Lincoln Laboratory after his 1951 graduation from MIT with degrees in electrical engineering. He joined the laboratory’s Long Range Communications Group  where his early research and development work was in ionospheric and tropospheric beyond-the-horizon communication techniques. As leader of the Systems Engineering Group from 1955 to 1964  he designed and directed Project West Ford  a series of experiments that demonstrated the feasibility of using orbiting thin-wire reflectors to support long-range  high-frequency radio transmissions. For this work  Morrow received an MIT Outstanding Achievement Award that cited his “imaginative contribution to a new concept of intercontinental microwave communication.”Throughout his career  Morrow was a pioneer in the development of advanced satellite communication systems for the U.S. military. Under his leadership and through his collaborations with staff and sponsors  the Laboratory’s Lincoln Experimental Satellite program developed a wide range of critically important technologies. Much of this technology continues to be central to military satellite communication systems used by the United States and its allies.Morrow helped to guide Lincoln Laboratory’s expansion into new areas of research and development. In 1969  while assistant director  he led a study group that investigated the possibility of establishing a major air traffic control program at the laboratory. Because of his recommendation to move forward  the laboratory created and has sustained a strong air traffic control program that has developed many important weather forecasting and aircraft safety systems over the past 36 years.Morrow also had the foresight to initiate the South Laboratory and Microelectronics Laboratory building projects. Both projects resulted in major improvements in Lincoln Laboratory facilities  and the upgraded prototyping and technology development spaces had a major impact on the success of programs at the laboratory.Morrow served on the Defense Science Board as a member from 1987 to 2002 and as a senior fellow from 2002 to 2009  contributing to dozens of task forces in areas such as space superiority  advanced semiconductors  homeland protection  and air defense. Morrow was a member of the Chief of Naval Operations Executive Panel for 37 years  the Naval War College Board of Advisors  the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board  and NASA's Advisory Council.During his distinguished career  Morrow received numerous awards  including the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1998  the Department of Defense Outstanding Public Service Award in 2010  and the Navy Superior Public Service Award in 2015. He was elevated to the level of fellow in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1966 and was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1978.Through his example  Morrow promoted an exceptional level of technical excellence and integrity  and left a profound impact on Lincoln Laboratory and many programs for our nation’s defense.Morrow was married for 65 years to the late Janice (Lombard) Morrow and is survived by his sons Clifford and Gregory Morrow  his daughter Carolyn Morrow  two grandsons  and a great-grandson. Information on visiting hours and a memorial service on Friday  Feb. 17  can be found at theBrasco and Sons website.
Otto Harling  professor emeritus of nuclear engineering  dies at 85,Otto K. Harling  MIT professor emeritus in nuclear engineering and former director of the MIT Nuclear Reactor Lab (NRL) passed away on Dec. 18. He was 85 years old.Harling's field-defining contributions in research and teaching cut across nuclear physics  condensed matter physics  nuclear materials  superfluids  fission and fusion reactor technology  and nuclear medicine.Born in 1931 on Staten Island  New York  Harling graduated from New Dorp High School and completed his undergraduate degree at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and the Illinois Institute of Technology. He went on to pursue graduate training in Germany at the University of Goettingen and the University of Heidelberg  and he earned his PhD at Pennsylvania State University.His career at MIT began when he was appointed in 1972 as a senior research associate. He received tenure in 1979 and was director of NRL from 1976 to 1996.Notably  Harling oversaw a significant expansion of the NRL’s research mission into nuclear materials irradiation and evaluation and boron neutron capture therapy. He was well known for developing productive collaborations on campus  in particular with MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering  and engaging with the country’s national laboratories to study fusion reactor materials. One of his most ambitious efforts used the MIT reactor core to simulate a fusion reactor to investigate radiation damage in irradiated materials and enable test methods to determine mechanical properties using miniature samples.“Otto Harling’s visionary research initiatives established the experimental basis for the use of the MIT reactor as a test bed for nuclear materials and engineering research ” says Gordon Kohse  MIT research scientist and deputy director of NRL research and services.Harling and his MIT colleagues also built on the technology and irradiation techniques developed for the fusion studies to establish a program in support of light water power reactor coolant technology. These experiments  involving the design and operation of innovative  small  in-core high-pressure and temperature water loops  were instrumental in understanding fundamental aspects of both pressurized water and boiling water reactor coolant chemistries. Success hinged on Harling’s ability to bring together a global array of partners  including the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute  the government of Japan  and other industrial members.During the latter part of his career  Harling was instrumental inreviving work on boron neutron capture therapy(BNCT) for cancer at the NRL. In 1994 he and his collaborators led a trial for the experimental therapy on a human patient  the first in more than 30 years and the first to use an epithermal beam (intermediate energy).In addition to his research contributions  Harling and his colleagues played a significant role in enhancing and expanding educational opportunities for nuclear engineers and scientists at MIT and beyond. He led a faculty effort in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) to broaden the radiological sciences curriculum  revamp courses on the measurement of radiation and its uses  and introduce experiments for the student laboratory and the MIT reactor.He also taught what is now 22.09  “Principles of Nuclear Radiation Measurement and Protection ” for several years. Harling also personally directed the thesis research of over 70 master’s and doctoral candidates at MIT and helped train generations of students at the NRL who have gone on to become leaders at national laboratories  companies  and medical institutions. He also shared his expertise through the publication of more than 300 scientific papers and reports and in book chapters he authored or edited.“Harling’s work was in the best tradition of MIT's philosophy of Mens and Manus ” says John A. Bernard  Jr  principal research engineer in NSE. “He loved building things — tools and equipment — and expected his students to be equally enthusiastic about getting their hands dirty when working on solutions to problems.”Harling was elected to a Fellowship in the American Nuclear Society in 2004 and received the Hatanaka Memorial Award  the highest recognition of the International Society for Neutron Capture Therapy  in 2008. Outside of his professional life  he was an avid tennis player and community volunteer  serving on Hingham’s Energy Action Committee  correcting Hingham’s latest flood maps and running climate change programs.He is survived by his wife of 59 years  Beth; his three daughters  Betsy Harling of Hingham  Maura Stefl (Greg) of Fayetteville  N.Y.  and Ottilie MacKinnon (Ewen) of Chichester  N.H.; his son  Kurt Harling (Lisa) of Durham  N.H.  his grandchildren Zachary and Hannah Stefl  Ian Mackinnon  Alexander and Mitchell Harling  and Joseph and Matthew Personeni  his sister Anneliese Ringstad of Malaga  Spain as well as many nieces and nephews.Donations in Harling’s memory may be made to “The Dr. Otto K.

Edith Ackermann  developmental psychologist and learning researcher  dies at 70,Edith Ackermann  who was a professor at the MIT Media Lab from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s  died in Cambridge  Massachusetts  on Dec. 24. She was 70.Swiss-born Ackermann earned all her degrees from the University of Geneva  Switzerland. She earned a bachelor's degree in experimental psychology in 1969  two master's degrees in developmental psychology and clinical psychology in 1970  and a PhD in developmental psychology in 1981.At the University of Geneva  she was part of an interdisciplinary research team under the direction of Jean Piaget  the Swiss developmental psychologist renowned for his pioneering work in child development. Ackermann considered Piaget a "hero" in her field. In a list of her greatest influences  Ackermann also included Maria Montessori  a renowned Italian physician and educator  as well as two founding faculty members of the Media Lab: Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert. It was the opportunity to work with Papert that drew Ackermann to the Media Lab in 1985  when she joined his Epistemology and Learning Group. There  Ackermann focused on technological tools for learning and emerging literacies.Onher website  Ackermann described her approach to education research: "I team up with partners from varying backgrounds to help shape the future of play and learning in a digital world. I study how people use place  relate to others  and treat things to find their ways — and voices — in an ever-changing world." Mitchel Resnick  the LEGO Papert Professor of Learning Research who worked with Ackermann in Papert’s group  says his late colleague "brought a joyful energy  probing questions  and fresh ideas to every conversation. She will be deeply missed."Ackermann’s relationship with the Media Lab extended well beyond her time on its faculty. Resnick  now head of the Media Lab’s Lifelong Kindergarten group  says that Ackermann continued "as a friend  collaborator  and advisor to people throughout the Media Lab community  serving on many general-exam and dissertation committees  and joining many Media Lab conversations and symposia  including a recentdiscussion about cybernetics."In addition to her ongoing affiliation as a visiting scientist at the Media Lab  Ackermann in recent years was a research affiliate at MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning  a visiting senior researcher for the LEGO Foundation  a senior research associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Design  an honorary professor of developmental psychology at the University of Aix-Marseille  France  and a visiting professor at the University of Siena  Italy. She has been honored with accolades throughout her career  most recently in October 2016  when she receiveda lifetime achievement awardat the FabLearn Conference at Stanford Graduate School of Education.Ackermann believed that her work was itself an act of continuous self-education. As she wrote on her Media Lab web page: "When it comes to learning and creative uses of technologies  children have more to teach adults than adults to children! When it comes to innovating for others  don’t guess what they want or do what they say:co-createwhat they — and you — will love  once it is there!"
Mariann Carnazzo  longtime MIT staff member  dies at 74 ,Longtime MIT employee Mariann (Marletta) Carnazzo of Somerville  Massachusetts  died on Saturday  Dec. 3  at the deRahm Hospice House in Cambridge  Massachusetts. She was 74.Carnazzo worked at MIT for 53 years  beginning in 1959 when she was in high school. She held many positions in what was then the Contract Accounting Office. In 1986  Carnazzo was promoted to administrative assistant in the Office of the Treasurer. She retired in 2012 as senior accounts payable assistant in the Office of the Vice President for Finance.Carnazzo is remembered by many at MIT as a generous and gracious colleague who worked hard and always pitched in to get the job done. Overseeing the front desk in accounts payable in Building E19 for many years  she greeted everyone with a warm smile and worked hard to resolve issues and solve problems.Carnazzo is survived by her husband  Joseph Carnazzo; son  Frank Rosa  and his fiancée  Aimee Sanborn  of Chelmsford  Massachusetts; stepchildren Joseph  Jerome  Thomas  Robert  Mark  Eric  and Christopher Carnazzo; and grandchildren Juliana and Gabriella Rosa of Wilmington  Massachusetts.

Richard Held  professor emeritus of brain and cognitive sciences  dies at 94,Richard M. Held  a professor emeritus and former head of MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences who spent a lifetime investigating the mechanisms of visual perception  died at home of congestive heart failure on Nov. 21. He was 94.As a faculty member and researcher at three institutions of higher education — Brandeis University  MIT  and the New England College of Optometry — Held pursued a lifelong interest in research on how the visual system develops and adapts  following the advice of Gestalt psychology founder and personal mentor Wolfgang Köhler to “make discoveries.”Held was born in Manhattan  New York City  on Oct. 10  1922  the only child of Lawrence W. Held  a shipping export broker  and Tess (Klein) Held  an artist who worked for a time in fashion design. He spent his childhood taking things apart — clocks  locks  and batteries — and then making things  including electric motors and crystal radios  and reading about Tom Swift  the boy inventor.In amemoirpublished in 2008 inThe History of Neuroscience in Autobiography  Held traced the source of his enduring interest in perception to a 1928 holiday ride with his parents on an excursion boat that sailed from Battery Park to Coney Island. As he recounted  “It was a bright sunny day  and once the boat was in the channel I scanned the water idly looking at birds and boats. At one point I shifted my gaze to the deck on which our chairs sat. I felt a mild shiver as I watched the deck. It was moving under me. What was happening? After a minute or two  I realized that the deck was not going anywhere  it just appeared to move: I would much later learn that this was a paradox that exemplifies the difference between perception and physics.”As a student at Columbia University  where he earned degrees in engineering and liberal arts  he was influenced by the celebrated art historian and personal mentor Meyer Schapiro  whom he credited with stirring his interest in research through an assignment to write about a piece of art. Held chose Van Gogh’s "Starry Night " observing the depiction of the moon resembled an eclipse  and speculating the painting was an allegory of the Holy Trinity. The essay prompted Schapiro to reference an illuminated medieval manuscript with a similar theme  and crediting Held with it in a journal article. Held wrote of the experience: “It showed me that with motivation  effort  and devotion  one could discover the underlying truths in the world and its artifacts: what I later learned to call research. And  just as important  I COULD DO IT.”Held served in the Navy in World War II  where he was a tactical radar officer on the USS Kadashan Bay and USS Saratoga in the Pacific  earning the rank of second lieutenant. He was stationed at Eniwetok Atoll  ready for a planned ground invasion  when the war ended after the dropping of the atomic bomb.After the war  he became a lab assistant to Wolfgang Köhler  who had left Nazi Germany in 1935 for Swarthmore College  co-authoring with him a 1949Sciencepaper demonstrating that moving a bright object in front of a stationary observer produced a corresponding electrical field in the brain. The paper’s conclusion was called “prophetic” of later research by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel that vision was made possible by electrical responses in individual neurons.Held earned a master’s degree from Swarthmore College  a doctorate from Harvard University  and joined the faculty of Brandeis University in 1953  where he remained until 1962. There  he conducted with then-graduate student and future MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences faculty colleague Alan Hein what became his most famous experiment  demonstrating that  in the words of Held’s late French colleague Marc Jeannerod  “perception is constructed by action.” Their work showed the strong role of self-produced movement in visual development: In order to properly judge depth  and distinguish between objects  animals (including humans) need active interaction with the environment. Simply seeing the world and being passively moved in it is not enough.Two kittens were placed in a carousel  one actively moving itself while pulling a passive mate in a gondola-like cradle. While both kittens were exposed to the same sights  only the kitten actively moving itself was able to acquire the ability to guide itself visually. For example  the active kitten could accurately reach for an object with its paw; the passive kitten could not. Forty-two years later  inspired by those results first published in 1963  researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the Centre for Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex reported in a 2005 paper that the same was true for robots capable of collision-free navigation.In 1962  Held moved to MIT to join then department head Hans-Lukas Teuber in the Department of Experimental Psychology  one of the earliest centers of neuroscience. As the chair of what is now MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) from 1977 to 1986  Held mentored several generations of graduate students  and oversaw the department's growth into one of the premiere neuroscience and cognitive science institutions. He was named professor emeritus in 1993.After retirement from MIT  from 2001 to 2010  he was director of research and graduate education at The New England College of Optometry in Boston  undertaking research with colleagues into the early development of myopia.In 2003  he joined the MIT laboratory of Pawan Sinha  a professor of vision and computational neuroscience  and became a collaborator in Project Prakash  a non-profit founded by Sinha that restores the sight of congenitally blind children in India and researches their subsequent development of vision. In a paper published in 2011 inNature Neurosciencetitled “The newly sighted fail to match seen with felt ” Held and Sinha reported that newly-sighted subjects who sensed objects with their hands could not identify them by sight — at least at first. However  after a week with sight  their abilities rapidly improved. The findings  which answered a question first posed in 1688  forced a reconsideration of the conventional view that if children lack sight in early childhood  they will never be able to make visual sense of the world. The rapidity of improvement suggested that the visual system is  in some sense  pre-wired  but relies importantly on the feedback between sight and touch that is gained by experience."Dick made a remarkable set of contributions to vision science  all with a deep appreciation for the history of which he was part " says Steven Pinker  the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. "I had learned about Dick’s work as an undergraduate in Montreal in 1972  and it was a privilege to have been his colleague. He will be missed  but remembered."Lothar Spillmann  professor of psychology at the National Taiwan University adds: “He was a great scientist and mentor and a beacon of modesty  fairness  and honesty. His passing leaves a tremendous void in the field. To those of us who remember him  he will always be in our hearts and lovingly so.”Scientific research was a source of pleasure to Held until the end of his life  and he maintained close contact with his colleagues  attending meetings of Sinha’s laboratory until six months before his death. His final paper of more than 200  in which he was a senior author with Sinha as lead author  was published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Scienceswhen he was 92 years old — a testament to his unending devotion to research. The paper  “Autism as a disorder of prediction ” laid out a far-reaching theoretic framework to account for multiple aspects of autism  and has already proved influential in guiding empirical studies that seek to understand this complex condition. He died with an open copy ofScience Newsnext to his computer keyboard.Held led an active life  commuting by bicycle to MIT in the 1960s and 1970s at a time when that was rare  and was an avid tennis player into his 60s at the Cambridge Tennis Club. With his wife  he was an enthusiastic member of the Old Cambridge Shakespeare Association  which met monthly to read the works of the Bard aloud. Over the past decade-and-a-half  he was an active member of a memoir-writing group led by Clark C. Abt  the founder of a policy research firm  where his autobiographical sketches revealed a wry sense of humor in finely-crafted prose.Held was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded three honorary doctorates  including one from the Free University of Brussels presented by King Baudouin  and received multiple professional awards including the Galileo Award of the American Foundation for Vision Awareness  the Kenneth Craik Award from Cambridge University  the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists  and the Glenn A. Fry Award from the American Academy of Optometry.He is survived by his wife of 65 years  Doris Bernays Held  a retired psychotherapist; three children  Lucas Held of New Haven  Connecticut  Julia Held of Westhampton  Massachusetts  and Andrew Held of Northampton  Massachusetts; and two grandchildren. In June  he and Doris moved to Northampton to be close to their daughter Julia and her family.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to Project Prakash  955 Massachusetts Avenue  Suite 351  Cambridge  MA 02139  or throughprojectprakash.org.

Professor Emeritus Bruce Mazlish  pioneer in the field of global history  dies at 93,Bruce Mazlish  a highly regarded historian who served as a professor of history at MIT for more than 50 years  died of natural causes on Nov. 27. He was 93 years old.A winner of the prestigious Toynbee Prize  which recognizes social scientists for significant academic and public contributions to humanity  Mazlish published numerous influential volumes in the course of his career  including "The Western Intellectual Tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel" (Harper Bros  1960)  which is still used in college courses today.Mazlish pioneered the field ofpsychohistory  along with historians such as Erik Erikson  in volumes including "James and John Stuart Mill: Father and Son in the 19th Century" (Basic Books  1975). Over more than five decades as a scholar  he published more than two dozen volumes of history and was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Born in Brooklyn  New York  on Sept. 15  1923  Mazlish attended Boys High School and graduated from Columbia University in 1940. During World War II  he served in the Office of Strategic Services  the precursor to the modern Central Intelligence Agency  and he later returned to Columbia to earn his PhD in European studies.After spells as a journalist and then a high school teacher  Mazlish joined the faculty of the University of Maine in Brunswick  before coming to MIT in 1955. He subsequently spent the rest of his professional life at the Institute  retiring in 2003. Courses he taught include “Marx  Darwin  and Freud ” “Modernity  Post-modernity and Capitalism ” and “The New Global History.”Mazlish’s first book  "The Western Intellectual Tradition " co-authored with British mathematician Jacob Bronowski  argued that the foundations for modern science can be found in a set of insights initially made during the Renaissance. This and other of Mazlish’s volumes found a broad and enthusiastic general readership. His well-known profile of President Richard Nixon  "In Search of Nixon " which was published just a month before the Watergate revelations  remains widely read to this day.In the late 1980s  Mazlish began to explore post-WWII globalization  examining the idea of humanity from an historical and interdisciplinary perspective. Out of this came  among other things  the New Global History Initiative  launched in the early 2000s with the goal of reimagining the study of history in a more pluralistic  multicultural age.Mazlish is survived by his wife  Neva Goodwin  of Cambridge  Massachusetts; his sister  Elaine Wyden  of Westport  Connecticut; and a former wife  Anne Mazlish  of Mount Desert  Maine. His first marriage was to Constance Shaw  who passed away in 1993. He is also survived by his four children  Cordelia Savala and Peter Shaw Mazlish of Atlanta  Georgia; Anthony Mazliish of Chevy Chase  Maryland; and Jared Mazlish of Burlington  Vermont; as well as two stepchildren and six grandchildren.
Arthur Kaledin  professor emeritus of history and American studies  dies at 86,Arthur D. Kaledin  professor emeritus of history and American studies  died on Saturday  Nov. 27  at the age of 86 at Massachusetts General Hospital  surrounded by family and close friends.Kaledin graduated from Harvard University in 1952  and following several years in the U.S. Army — during which he sustained an injury that led him to walk with a cane thereafter — he returned to Harvard  where he received his PhD in 1964. Kaledin subsequently joined what was then called the Humanities Department at MIT  and went on to teach several generations of students at the Institute.Reflecting on his former colleague  MIT Associate Provost and Ford International Professor of History Philip S. Khoury said  “Arthur was a splendid colleague and a dedicated teacher who thrived in the small seminar settings that MIT provides students for their humanities courses."Of Kaledin’s "Tocqueville and His America: A Darker Horizon" (Yale University Press  2011)  a much-admired biography of French diplomat and political scientist Alexis de Tocqueville  Professor Stanley Katz  a historian and legal scholar at Princeton University said  “Kaledin teases out the ambiguities and complexities of Tocqueville’s life with astonishing perspicuity  offering a subtle and complex analysis.”In his 2011 story about "Tocqueville and His America " MIT News writer Peter Dizikes recounts a conversation with Kaledin about his book: "'Tocqueville saw cultural and social tendencies that he thought would weaken American democracy ’ Kaledin said….[His] apprehensions  in Kaledin’s view  largely focused on the problems a democratic culture might pose for democratic politics. For instance  Kaledin says  Tocqueville thought ‘populism would gradually lead to an anti-intellectual culture and to mediocrity in political leadership.’ Tocqueville was also  Kaledin says  uneasy with the extent to which American culture 'heavily emphasized material values over all others.'"Remembering Kaledin’s devotion to teaching  Professor Jeffrey Ravel  current head of the MIT History section  said  “Arthur was a fiercely principled teacher. In the classroom he challenged MIT undergraduates to think about the political and moral implications of the technologies they were creating. His contributions to the formation of the great engineers  scientists  scholars  and world citizens we educate at MIT will not easily be replicated.”Scores of MIT graduates will remember Kaledin for his accessibility and warmth — among them the many students who  when they could not travel home for the holiday  were invited to join the Kaledin family for Thanksgiving  as well as students in Kaledin’s freshman seminars  who enjoyed his tradition of an annual class lunch at Mary Chung’s restaurant  where the proprietor invariably greeted Kaledin with “Good to see you again  Professor!”Kaledin's early Army injury eventually led to his use of a wheelchair in later years  a fact that did nothing to dampen his love of life. He is survived by his former wife  Eugenia (Oster) Kaledin  of Lexington  Massachusetts; two sons  Nicholas  of New York City  and Jonathan  of Princeton  New Jersey; a daughter  Elizabeth  of New York City; and seven grandchildren.Kaledin will long be remembered for his sustained contributions to MIT and to the humanities generally. Family and friends note that he will particularly be missed for his wit and wisdom  his huge heart  his conversation and wide-ranging interests  and how engaged and doting he was as a father and grandfather.Private services are planned.
Professor Emeritus Jay Forrester  digital computing and system dynamics pioneer  dies at 98,Jay W. Forrester SM ’45  professor emeritus in the MIT Sloan School of Management  founder of the field of system dynamics  and a pioneer of digital computing  died Nov. 16. He was 98.Forrester’s time at MIT was rife with invention. He was a key figure in the development of digital computing  the national air defense system  and MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory. He developed servomechanisms (feedback-based controls for mechanical devices)  radar controls  and flight-training computers for the U.S. Navy. He led Project Whirlwind  an early MIT digital computing project. It was his work on Whirlwind that led him to invent magnetic core memory  an early form of RAM for which he holds the patent  in 1949.MIT Sloan Professor John Sterman  a student  friend  and colleague of Forrester’s since the 1970s  points to a 2003 photo of Forrester on a Segway as an illustration of his work’s lasting impact.“He really is standing on top of the fruits of his many careers ” Sterman said. “He’s standing on a device that integrates servomechanisms  digital controllers  and a sophisticated feedback control system.”“From the air traffic control system to 3-D printers  from the software companies use to manage their supply chains to the simulations nations use to understand climate change  the world in which we live today was made possible by Jay’s work ” he said.Systems dynamics: A new view of managementIt was after turning his attention to management in the mid-1950s that Forrester developed system dynamics — a model-based approach to analyzing complex organizations and systems — while studying a General Electric appliance factory. AnMIT Technology Reviewarticle explores how hesought to combat the factory’s boom-and-bust cycleby examining its “weekly orders  inventory  production rate  and employees.” He then developed a computer simulation of the GE supply chain to show how management practices  not market forces  were causing the cycle.Forrester’s “Industrial Dynamics” was published in 1961. The field expanded to chart the complexities of economies  supply chains  and organizations. Later  he cast the principles of system dynamics on global issues in “Urban Dynamics ” published in 1969  and “World Dynamics ” published in 1971. The latter was an integrated simulation model of population  resources  and economic growth. Forrester became a critic of growth  a position that earned him few friends.“Many businesses  government officials  and academics hated it ” Sterman said  “yet today  the collision between the finite resources of our planet and population and economic growth drives issues from climate change to deforestation  collapsing fisheries  resource conflict  and mass migrations.” Four of Forrester’s students would rely on his ideas to write “The Limits to Growth ” a 1972 book that helped to launch the field of global modeling and the sustainability movement around the world.In many ways  system dynamics stands in opposition to the idea that a charismatic or talented leader can steer a wayward firm to success  a tension Forrester explained toMIT Technology Review.“Very often people are just role players within a [company’s] system ” he said. “They are not running it; they are acting within it. This has not been a popular idea with people who think they are in charge … but in fact  unless they are knowledgeable in systems  they will fall into a pattern of doing what the system dictates. If they understand the system  they can alter that behavior.”At MIT Sloan  Forrester created the Refrigerator Game  a supply chain simulation that teaches the principles of system dynamics. It was later dubbedthe Beer Gameand remains a popular exercise during student orientation.“What made Jay so special is because of his background in digital computing  he saw  with the advent of the digital computer  the ability to do simulations that were both large-scale and practical ” said MIT Sloan Professor Nelson Repenning. “He appreciated that far before anyone.”From the family ranch to MITAll this from a boy who grew up working the family ranch.“I’ve had several careers ” he toldMIT Technology Review.“Starting with ranch hand.”Forrester was born July 14  1918 in Nebraska. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska in 1939. He arrived at MIT the same year as a graduate student in the School of Engineering  earning a master's in 1945. He joined what would become the MIT Sloan faculty in 1956 and retired in 1989.“To me  Jay was MIT ” Repenning said. “He showed up to work on gunsights and radar mounts for the U.S. military  ended up playing a pioneering role in digital computing  and suddenly became a social scientist. I can’t imagine that happening anywhere else. It was the perfect match of a unique person [and institution].”Sterman said Forrester had high standards as a teacher  but that submitting work to his rigorous inspection was rewarding.“It was a great experience to have Jay mark up one of your papers with his red pen ” he said. “The way to learn the most from Jay was first of all to recognize that he was probably right and you were wrong  and secondly  to just be grateful for the gift of all that criticism  because everything you did after that was better.”Forrester was married for 64 years to Susan (Swett) Forrester  who died in 2010. He is survived by a daughter  Judith; two sons  Nathan and Ned; four grandchildren  Matthew  Julia  Neil  and Katherine; and two great grandchildren  Everett and Faraday.
Stephen Connors  leading alternative energy researcher  dies at 58,Stephen R. Connors SM '89  director of the MIT Analysis Group for Regional Energy Alternatives (AGREA) and a leading alternative-energy researcher who helped bring solar and wind power into the mainstream  died peacefully at home on Nov. 13 after a four-year battle with cancer. He was 58.“Steve was a wonderful colleague ” reflects Robert Armstrong  director of the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). “His research on renewable energy balanced technology  systems  and human needs carefully. This was particularly well illustrated by his work on Green Islands as part of the MIT-Portugal program. He was a terrifically optimistic and positive collaborator  and one of the most resilient people I have ever had the pleasure to know. He will be sorely missed in our community.”Connors spent more than 26 years working at MIT as a researcher  mentor  and instructor. He led alternative energy projects around the world at a time when many people were still skeptical about their viability. He thus helped usher in the current era where solar and wind installations can be seen dotting landscapes around the world  serving as mainstream energy solutions in a number of countries.“His love was regional energy planning with a special emphasis on integrating renewable energy sources and conservation into energy grids ” says David Marks  the Goulder Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Engineering Systems  emeritus  and professor emeritus of the MIT Institute for Data  Systems  and Society. “He worked on a variety of projects in Portugal; Norway; Mexico City; Shandong  China; Switzerland; Argentina; the United Kingdom; and even New England looking at a broad array of scenarios around new generation technologies.”Connors was a prominent figure at the MIT Laboratory for Energy and the Environment  where he served as director of the Alliance for Global Sustainability Energy Flagship program and then director of AGREA. In both roles  he tackled a variety of energy challenges across the globe. He believed that there is no single silver-bullet solution for a sustainable energy future and that instead we need to optimize a portfolio of solutions and within each technology to move from “best practice” to “next practice.”Additionally  as a distinguished researcher and mentor in a variety of MITEI programs  Connors led a cross-Atlantic partnership between MIT and major technological universities in Portugal that was designed to integrate renewable resources like wind  solar  and tidal into energy grids. This joint research included a major focus on strengthening graduate energy and technology programs at Portugal’s leading technology institutes. Connors’ work in Portugal was a powerful demonstration of his ability to marry research with real-world practice to change the way energy is supplied and used in the world.In the Azores  Connors led the Green Islands Program  which designed to use this region as a testing ground for renewable integration and as a platform for other islands that are dependent on imported fossil fuels. Recently  Portugal was listed as one of the first countries to run four days straight on only renewable energy (wind  solar  and hydro generated electricity)  producing zero emissions. As of 2015  renewables provide 48 percent of Portugal’s electricity.“Steve Connors represented the best of a research and a student-advising colleague that any of us could have had ” recalls Richard Tabors  director of the Utility of the Future study and visiting scholar at MITEI. “From the first days of the AGREA project through multiple international renewable efforts he was always the ‘go to’ person — for facts  for support  for the next good idea  and for a smile and a positive word. The MIT energy community has lost a terrific colleague.”Connors was a frequent and popular speaker on all energy issues at many global forums. In 2014  he shared his views on how to build a bridge to a more sustainable energy future in a well-attendedTEDx talk. He met his wife when he accepted her invitation to speak at a local Cambridge community potluck and arrived with a PowerPoint on wind energy and a homemade broccoli salad.In early work with the Peace Corps in Benin  Connors lived for two years in a hut with no running water or electricity and was charged with building wood-conserving cooking stoves to save forests. The experience taught him the importance of adapting technology to a specific geography. He was a tireless advocate for a more sustainable future  and these passions led him to co-foundAltWheels  which has become one of the larger alternative transportation festivals in New England for fleets  and to co-chair the conservation committee for the Appalachian Mountain Club.Connors had a deep love of nature  hiking  and exploration. His travels and work took him to various countries  among them Switzerland  France  England  Germany  Norway  Sweden  Denmark  Spain  Portugal  Italy  Mexico  Canada  Costa Rica  Ecuador  Thailand  Cambodia  Japan  China  India  Zimbabwe  South Africa  Botswana  Benin  Togo  Niger  Kenya  and Saudi Arabia.Born in Lakewood  Ohio  in 1958  Connors attended the University of Massachusetts at Amherst  where he studied physical anthropology and in 1980 received a BA magna cum laude with concentrations in economic development  technology and change  and applied and biological anthropology. After serving in the Peace Corps  he returned to UMass Amherst  where in 1986 he received a BS cum laude in mechanical engineering with a concentration in energy systems  solar  wind  hydrogen  water  thermodynamics  and fluid mechanics. He also earned a master’s in technology and policy at MIT in 1989 with concentrations in electric power systems planning  energy and the environment  and the use of technical information in complex decision-making processes.Connors is survived by his wife  Alison Sander; his mother  Margaret Connors; his two sisters  Jennifer Connors and Martha Connors; his brother  Mike Connors; and four nieces.Services will be held at Newbury Court in Concord  Massachusetts  in December and at the MIT Chapel in spring 2017. Details will be shared on Connors’ website:stephenrconnors.com.
D. Reid Weedon  MIT Corporation member and dedicated fundraiser  dies at 96,D. Reid Weedon Jr. ’41  MIT Corporation life member emeritus  global businessman  inspiring mentor  lifelong sailor and outdoorsman  and outstanding fundraiser for the institutions he loved  died at his home in Cohasset  Massachusetts  on Nov. 2 at the age of 96.Born in Newton  Massachusetts  Weedon earned a BS in general engineering at MIT in 1941 and later served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Shortly after the war  he joined the international consulting firm Arthur D. Little (ADL)  retiring as senior vice president after more than 50 years. One of his first clients was the government of Puerto Rico  which hired ADL to help industrialize its economy.Most notable of his work for ADL  and most meaningful to him  was monitoring the “Sullivan Principles.” Set forth by the Reverend Leon Sullivan  these principles for U.S. companies doing business in South Africa sought to end South Africa's economic isolation and  ultimately  apartheid. This work lasted 17 years until South Africa approved the reform process and held its first democratic elections in 1994. Weedon’s final visit  of more than 21 trips to that country  came just after Nelson Mandela was released from prison.A tireless volunteer and trustee  Weedon loved — and excelled at — fundraising. MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote that he doubted “there has been anyone more instrumental than Weedon in building a culture of giving at MIT  and the benefits of this are everywhere around me.”Weedon served in almost every leadership position at MIT. He was a member of the MIT Corporation  president of the MIT Alumni Association  an energetic force in every MIT capital campaign  and a mentor to a generation of fundraisers who remained devoted to him. He was a dedicated member of the Phi Beta Epsilon fraternity at MIT and was committed throughout his life to supporting the academic  personal  and professional development of its undergraduates.At Boston's Museum of Science  Weedon became a life trustee after serving as chair of its board. In recent years  he chaired the museum’s planned giving subcommittee and served as a member of the campaign executive committee. He was also a trustee of the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences. As Linda Leddy  past president of Manomet  recalls  "'No' was not a word that meant much to Weedon — there was always a way ahead."Weedon and his wife  the late Barbara Jencks Weedon  were longtime residents of Winchester  Massachusetts  where Reid was president of the Winchester Hospital board. He played a significant role in planning for the present and future of the Weedon homestead  constructed in the early 1890s by his grandfather in Blowing Rock  North Carolina  and was the head of the Weedon Family Corporation  now numbering more than 160 descendants.He loved to fly. Weedon was a licensed pilot  glider pilot  and hot air balloon operator. He cherished his time in Southport  Maine. In the 1960s  he bought a small island where he and his family built a cabin — transporting everything themselves. A keen sailor  he loved boats and built more than half a dozen during his lifetime; he was still cruising the waters of Maine at age 93. He enjoyed gardening  and no weed was safe in his lawn. If the tool did not exist  he would invent and craft one.Weedon is survived by his wife  Estelle Miller Weedon  of Cohasset; his son  Charles Reid Weedon  and partner Susan Devokaitis of Pomfret  Connecticut; his daughter  Sarah Jencks Weedon  and partner Deirdre Robinson of Bristol  Rhode Island; his granddaughter  Emily Weedon Chapman  and partner Peter Chapman  and great-grandson Corbett Reid Chapman  all of Washington. He is also survived by Rebecca Lacy  Nicholas Lacy  and Margaret Lacy Golston  the children of his sister  the late Mary Weedon Lacy; and by his stepdaughters  Amanda Cashman Harvey and Josephine Cashman.A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m.  Friday  Dec. 2  in the MIT Chapel  48 Massachusetts Avenue  Cambridge  Massachusetts. Donations may be made in his memory toMIT  theMuseum of Science  or theManomet Center for Conservation Sciences.
Susan Lindquist  pioneering biologist and former director of Whitehead Institute  dies at 67,MIT Professor Susan Lee Lindquist  a member and former director of the Whitehead Institute  and one of the nation’s most lauded scientists  yesterday succumbed to cancer at age 67. Her nearly 40-year career was defined by intellectually courageous  boundary-defying research and a passion for nurturing new generations of scientific talent.“Sue has meant so much to Whitehead as an institution of science  and as a community of scientists  and her passing leaves us diminished in so many ways ” reflects David C. Page  director of Whitehead Institute and a professor of biology at MIT. “She was a risk-taker and an innovator. She believed that if we were not reaching for things beyond our grasp  we were not doing our job as researchers; if we were not constantly striving for that which we could only imagine  we were not fulfilling our obligations to society as scientists.”A cornerstone of the Whitehead Institute community  a professor of biology at MIT  and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator  Lindquist was a widely respected researcher with a global reputation for biomedical innovation. She made numerous  invaluable contributions to the study of protein folding  demonstrating that alternative protein conformations can have profound and unexpected influences. Lindquist’s research transformed budding yeast into a model organism for studying human disease  evolution  and biomaterials.She was best known for her work on prions — proteins that exhibit an unusual ability to exist in multiple stable structural states  with altered functions depending on the state. Using yeast  she and her colleagues demonstrated that prions have the capacity to drive change in an organism’s inherited characteristics without changing its DNA or RNA — relying instead on an ability to change how proteins fold. In a seminal breakthrough in evolutionary biology  her laboratory showed that prions can help activate many previously hidden (inactive) biophysical interactions  producing new traits that are passed on to subsequent generations. In other words  by uncovering (activating) previously hidden genetic variation that can help cells survive changes in their environment  prions provide a mechanism for the evolution of beneficial new traits.In humans  devastating neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer’s  Parkinson’s  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  and Huntington’s diseases involve proteins that change their conformation and thereby spur pathological processes. Among the many technical innovations created by her lab  Lindquist imported several of these disease-causing proteins into yeast  creating a platform with which to study disease-causing changes in protein folding in action and to test potential therapies for the ability to prevent the protein’s toxicity.A committed teacher and dedicated mentor to generations of biomedical and basic research scientists  Lindquist served as a professor at the University of Chicago for 23 years and then at MIT  where she had taught concurrent with her Whitehead Institute appointment since 2001. During her 15-year career at Whitehead alone  she supervised 115 fellows  graduate students  and undergraduates.“Inspired by Susan’s seminal work on the role of protein folding in evolutionary processes  I came to her laboratory at the Whitehead on a sabbatical from my role as a professor of pediatric oncology ” remembers Luke Whitesell  a senior research scientist in the Lindquist lab at Whitehead Institute. “Breaking traditional boundaries  we sought to learn whether some of the same basic mechanisms she had discovered in yeast might fuel the malignant progression of cancers and enable them to acquire drug resistance. The nurturing  extraordinarily cross-disciplinary research environment that she had created for her students and postdocs was captivating. Over a dozen years later  I am still here  privileged to have assisted her in training a new generation of physicians and scientists who share her conviction that deep biological insight is essential to improving the treatment of human diseases. We are all devastated by her loss  but determined to carry her vision forward.”Brooke Bevis  manager of the Lindquist lab  observes that  “Sue was the most creative  out-of-the-box scientific thinker I’ve known. She had a unique biological intuition — an instinct for the way things worked and the right questions to ask. And she was indefatigable  seeming to draw strength and stamina from the science itself.”From 2001 to 2004  Lindquist served as director of Whitehead Institute — becoming one of the first women in the nation to lead a major independent research organization. In 2004  she resumed her research focus as an Institute member  an associate member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard  and an associate member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.“Sue was a terrific scientist  colleague  and friend to many of us ” says Alan Grossman  the Praecis Professor of Biology and head of MIT’s Department of Biology. “She will be deeply missed at MIT and in the scientific community. Our thoughts and wishes go out to her family and loved ones.”“Sue's bold strategies and unique ideas to understand neurodegenerative disease were recognized by her peers and supported by generous partners  including the JPB Foundation and the Belfer Family Foundation ” observes Li-Huei Tsai  professor of neuroscience and director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT. “She was a titan in the field and a genuine luminary  appreciated for her candor  friendship  thoughtful behavior  and superb communication skills. Her work and influence will continue to accelerate the fight against diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s  as well as inspire and educate upcoming generations of scientific leaders.”“I met Sue when I arrived at the University of Chicago in 1980  and we’ve been close friends ever since. I was Sue’s maid of honor at her wedding; she introduced me to my husband ” recalls Elaine Fuchs  the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator at The Rockefeller University. “In Chicago  we taught together and shared our HHMI labs. Throughout these past 35 years  we’ve fueled each other’s science through many discussions and dinners together. I’ve never met another scientist as creative and visionary as Sue  nor a person so caring and loving. She was the gentle giant of science  and her work will continue to shape research and medicine — and inspire her family  friends  colleagues  students  and postdocs — long into the future.”An insightful leader with an incomparable perspective on the intersection of academic and commercial medical research  Lindquist served as an elected member of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors since 2004  chairing its Science  Technology and Sustainability Committee and sitting on its Regulatory  Compliance and Government Affairs Committee. A biomedical entrepreneur in her own right  she co-founded FoldRx Pharmaceuticals and founded Yumanity Therapeutics and REVOLUTION Medicines.“Sue’s global reputation in biomedical innovation and entrepreneurial spirit  her courageous leadership and her commitment to teaching are an inspiration for all of us and for generations to come ” says Alex Gorsky  chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson. “With her keen perspectives  Sue’s made invaluable contributions to Johnson & Johnson and consistently challenged us to deliver more innovation and enhance our commitment to scientific excellence and to patients worldwide.”Lindquist received many awards for her extraordinarily productive research  including the President’s National Medal of Science — the highest scientific honor bestowed by the United States — as well as the Dickson Prize in Medicine  the Otto-Warburg Prize  the Genetics Society of America Medal  the FASEB Excellence in Science Award  the Max Delbrück Medal  the Mendel Medal  the E.B. Wilson Medal  a Vallee Visiting Professorship  the Vanderbilt Prize for Women’s Excellence in Science and Mentorship  and the Albany Prize. She was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Medicine  the American Philosophical Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the British Royal Society.“Sue was not only a superb basic scientist  but also a committed leader ” says Erin O’Shea  president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. “She served as a role model for women in science  including me. Sue purposefully worked to mentor numerous students and postdocs  who have since gone on to successful careers. She will be deeply missed.”Born on June 5  1949  Lindquist earned an undergraduate degree in microbiology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a PhD in biology from Harvard University. She is survived by her husband  Edward Buckbee; two daughters  Alana Buckbee and Nora Buckbee; and Nora’s husband  Christopher Mannion; as well as her brothers and sisters-in-law Alan Lindquist and Stephanie Russell  and John Lindquist and Janice Moore.Gifts in honor and memory of Susan Lindquist may be made to the Whitehead Institute Fund to Encourage Women in Science (lindquistfund@wi.mit.edu).
Ira Dyer  professor emeritus of ocean engineering  dies at 91,Ira Dyer  professor emeritus of ocean engineering  died peacefully at his home on Oct. 9 at the age of 91.Dyer’s distinguished career  with a specialty in acoustics  spanned over six decades. His seminal research had profound impacts in the fields of aeroacoustics  structural acoustics  and underwater acoustics.Dyer was a valued educator and mentor for many students who are now prominent scientists  and he served as head of MIT's Department of Ocean Engineering (which later merged with the Department of Mechanical Engineering) for 10 years. He also served as president of the Acoustical Society of America and on numerous committees  blue ribbon panels  and advisory boards for government agencies and research companies.Born in Brooklyn  New York  in 1925  Dyer was the son of Frieda and Charles Dyer  who immigrated to the United States after being forced to flee the Pale of Settlement region of Russia. Dyer thrived as a student at Brooklyn Tech  where his scientific interests were nurtured. He served in the Army Air Corps during World War II  and studied at MIT under the GI bill following the war  receiving his PhD in physics in 1954. In 1949 Dyer married his sweetheart  Betty Schanberg of Clinton  Massachusetts. They were happily married for 68 years.After his graduate studies  Dyer joined Bolt  Beranek  and Newman Inc.  now BBN Technologies. He was hired by Leo Beranek  who would later say that Dyer was one of the three most important people responsible for the success of the company. In one of his first projects  Dyer designed  built  and tested an ultrasonic brain scanner. This system was intended to use active sonar to find brain tumors  and Dyer himself was the first person to undergo an ultrasonic brain scan. The system ended up only measuring bone thickness  but it paved the way for the ultrasonic scanners currently used in cardiology and gynecology.Dyer later led others in an applied research division that investigated all aspects of sound and vibration in complex structures such as ships  submarines  aircraft  and spacecraft  which resulted in many publications in theJournal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA). During the mid 1950s  Dyer helped design the U.S. Navy X-1 submarine  a small four-person diesel-electric sub with a very quiet radiated noise mission. He designed an innovative "triple-stage isolation" engine-mounting system that significantly quieted the vehicle  allowing the submarine to pass sound restrictions. The isolation concept led the way for the U.S. Navy to develop ultraquiet submarines  which provided significant advantages for U.S. submarine operations during the Cold War.In 1960  the Acoustical Society of America honored Dyer’s early work with its Biennial Award  a recognition to scientists under 35 for their outstanding contributions to acoustics.In 1971  Dyer became head of the MIT Department of Ocean Engineering  which eventually merged with the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2005. At its helm  he led the department into new areas of ocean engineering that emphasized learning about the ocean environment. Later  Dyer was named the Weber-Shaughness Professor of Ocean Engineering. His expertise and graduate course in ocean acoustics were legendary; he was a consummate professor  both as a lecturer and one-on-one  with a clarity that inspired his students.In July of 1973  Dyer became director of the Sea Grant Program at MIT. Under his leadership  the Sea Grant Program  created to stimulate research and wise use of the oceans  became a model program  and was widely emulated. Dyer also nurtured other new subjects in ocean acoustics  especially in conjunction with the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program. For many years Dyer played a major role in advising  researching  and designing anti-submarine warfare systems for the Navy  keeping our nation safe during the Cold War.Dyer made many seminal contributions to acoustics that were published inJASA.His article on the scintillation of ocean ambient noise is still one of the most cited today  as are his significant contributions to structural acoustics  reverberation  and propagation of sound in the sea. The programs Dyer established in these technical areas were international in scope.Beginning in 1978  Dyer led and participated in six Arctic field programs. The first  the Canadian Basin Arctic Reverberation Experiment  imaged the entire Arctic basin with acoustics  providing evidence of seamounts. He and his students developed a taxonomy of ice noise events that has been fundamental for understanding Arctic noise. In the 1990s  Dyer resumed his research on structural acoustics that influenced contemporary submarine designs: He contributed to one high-level Navy technical advisory committee that led to the contemporary submarine sonar signal-processing suite.Dyer was a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; a member of the National Academy of Engineering; and a visiting fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge University. He was the recipient of many awards and honors in his long and distinguished career; in 1996 he was awarded the Per Bruel Gold Medal by the Acoustical Society of America  its highest honor.After the collapse of the Soviet Union  Dyer and his wife  Betty  worked with the organization Action of Soviet Jewry to help place Soviet refugees in appropriate jobs  and they also sponsored a newly arrived family. Dyer was also a longtime philanthropist  with gifts benefiting medical research  the arts  community causes  MIT  and Clark University in Worcester  Massachusetts.As an independent research consultant during the past 20 years  Dyer served on the board of directors and provided expertise to local ocean acoustic consulting firms founded by some of his former students. He was instrumental in helping to solve a pump vibration problem at the Deer Island Sewer Treatment facility; this problem impacted the construction completion schedule  and the solution allowed the project  a major construction project to eliminate Boston Harbor pollution  to move forward and the pump to operate safely.Dyer’s joy was in challenging conventional thinking and being challenged by colleagues and students. If one of his students would say  “The data don’t agree with the theory ” Dyer would wag his finger and say  “No  no . . .  The theory does not agree with the data!” Meetings with Dyer are still recalled with gusto. He challenged all to continuously learn and acquire knowledge. He took great pleasure in family and friends  and he will be deeply missed.Dyer is survived by his wife  Betty; son Samuel Dyer and daughter-in-law Barbara; daughter Debora Dyer Mayer and son-in-law John; and three grandchildren: Ethan Dyer  Charley Mayer  and Owen Mayer.Individuals wishing to make a donation in Dyer’s memory can do so to the following: Parents and Researchers Interested in Smith-Magenis Syndrome (PRISMS)  which supports those with a genetic disorder that Dyer’s oldest grandson was born with;Care Dimensions  the North Shore hospice that was wonderful and loving to the Dyer family; or theCharles and Frieda Dyer Memorial Fund(3413500)  a tuition scholarship at MIT established by Ira and Betty in honor of Dyer's parents.
Professor Emeritus Whitman Richards dies at 84,Whitman Richards '53  PhD '65  professor emeritus of cognitive sciences and of media arts and sciences and principal investigator in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  died on Sept. 16 after a long battle with myelofibrosis. One of the first four PhD graduates of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS)  his more than 60 years at MIT were marked by a dedication to the experimental and theoretical study of vision  perception  and cognition.Richards began his affiliation with MIT as an undergraduate  matriculating in 1950. His decision to return to MIT for graduate work was greatly inspired by a meeting with BCS founder and then department head Professor Hans-Lukas Teuber.“In the 1960’s  with the advent of accessible computer technology  the development of information theory  and the single electrode  there was renewed excitement about prospects for modeling and understanding mind and brain ” Richards said in a 2004 interview. “Teuber’s charisma and broad vision for a new psychol­ogy was a powerful draw [to the department]. …There was a unique opportunity for a non-traditional grounding in a discipline otherwise mired in tradition.”Richards’ early research pursued traditional psychophysical experimental methods to study the mechanisms of color perception and stereovision. In the 1970s  his research direction and methodology shifted dramatically after meeting noted physiologist David Marr  who he eventually recruited to MIT. Instead of relying on the traditional experimental methods that had characterized his early career  Richards  Marr  and colleagues began to look for the deep  underlying mathematical principles that allowed a human or artificial visual system to look at the world and make accurate inferences about what the system saw or perceived.“The breadth of his research was really quite remarkable ” says Josh Tenenbaum  MIT professor of computational cognitive science and former Richards graduate student. “As his career developed  he transitioned from studying the parts of vison that are very close to neural mechanisms  to computational representations of perception  to Bayesian statistical models of perception and cognition. He became almost a computational social scientist — he was incredibly flexible in his thinking.”Richards’ passionate advocacy for the computational approach to studying visual perception helped to create and nurture the department’s early computational research initiatives.“Whit’s connection with David Marr back in the late '70s is really the genesis of modern computational social science today ” says MIT Professor Alex Pentland  the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Science and a former Richards graduate student.Alongside his impressive research legacy  which includes the publication of eight books and over 200 articles  Richards was also regarded by his students and colleagues as a superlative mentor. Many of his former students have found success in a variety of different fields  including psychology  cognitive science  computer science  media  computer graphics  and the defense industry.“Whitman was an incredibly dedicated advisor. His strategy was to have very few students and make a huge personal investment in each of them ” says John Rubin  a former graduate student of Richards and current executive producer with Tangled Bank Studios at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. “He was really great at keeping enthusiasm high in his lab  which took all kinds of forms  but included croquet parties at his home  which were terrifically fun. He was always available and  in fact  it was hard for me to keep up with the amount of time he wanted to devote to our joint work! He was indefatigable and devoted.”Richards is survived by his wife of 54 years  Waltraud Weller Richards  and three daughters: Diana Richards Doyle and husband Mark S. Doyle of Green Cove Springs  Florida; Sylvia Richards-Gerngross and husband Tillman Gerngross of Hanover  New Hampshire; and Eleanor "Nora" Richards Bender and husband Thomas A. Bender of Dedham  Massachusetts. He is also survived by his two siblings: Lincoln K. Richards and wife Gerda of Wellesley  Massachusetts  and Sylvia Richards Messner of Cave Creek  Arizona; and by two grandchildren  Morgan Kelly Doyle and Serafina Richards-Gerngross. Memorial services will be private.
Professor Emeritus Ali Javan  inventor of the first gas laser  dies at 89,MIT Professor Emeritus Ali Javan  the institute's first Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics  who was a trailblazer in the fields of laser technology and quantum electronics  died of natural causes in Los Angeles on Sept. 12  at the age of 89. In 1960  while working at Bell Laboratories  Javan invented the world’s first gas laser. The technology would be applied to telecommunications  internet data transmission  holography  bar-code scanners  medical devices  and more.Javan came to MIT as an associate professor of physics in 1961  and founded the nation’s first large-scale research center in laser technology. Javan also developed the first method for accurately measuring the speed of light and launched the field of high-resolution laser spectroscopy.“In the 1960s and 1970s  Professor Javan's laser group at MIT was a hotbed of innovation and advances in amazingly broad areas in laser physics ” saidIrving P. HermanPhD '77  who studied with Javan and is currently the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Applied Physics at Columbia University. “His group was key to understanding the fundamentals of the interactions of laser with matter  and in implementing them. He will be remembered by his many students and colleagues as a brilliant man  a pioneer  an inspiring man  and a kind and dear man.”From Tehran to New York CityAli Javan was born in Tehran  Iran  in 1926  and came to the United States in 1949  where he studied and worked at Columbia University with Nobel prize-winning physicist Charles H. Townes. Not having received either a bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree  Javan earned his PhD in physics at Columbia in 1954  with Townes serving as his thesis advisor.While at Columbia  Javan also studied music  continuing a lifelong passion for the arts that he often connected to his groundbreaking scientific work. “Physics and music — you find the same spirit in both of them ” Javanonce wrote. “It just manifests itself in different directions. There’s something immensely beautiful about physics  even though it’s very difficult. Take the atom — a single atom is absolutely gorgeous. Ask anybody in physics.”Making history: The first gas laserIn 1958  Javan developed the working principle of the first gas discharge helium neon laser. In the following two years  he worked at Bell Laboratories to build it  along with colleague William Bennett.“The first laser  the ruby laser by Ted Maiman  used optical pumping to create the population inversion necessary to achieve lasing ” Herman notes. “At the time this was difficult and not applicable to all systems. Javan was able to see how a population inversion can be created in a gas discharge by selective  resonant energy transfer. This was key to his invention of the first gas laser  the He-Ne laser  which was also the first continuous wave laser.”Javan’s breakthrough came on Dec. 12  1960  after a snowstorm had forced an early closure of the Murray  New Jersey-based Bell Labs. At 4:20 pm that day (Javan checked his watch)  for the first time in history  a continuous laser light beam emanated from a gas laser apparatus. As Javanlater describedit  he “drove the design into its self-sustained oscillation mode. Emanating at its output  for this very first-time ever  a continuous-wave (CW)  collimated light beam  at a color purity as it proved to the limits that the law of nature will permit.”On Dec. 13  1960  Javan and his Bell Labs colleagues used the laser light beam to place a telephone call  the first time in history that a laser beam had been used to transmit a telephone conversation.Joining the MIT communityJavan was already an internationally-acclaimed scientist when he came to MIT in 1961. He would spend the next four decades working to drive advances in atomic  molecular  and optical physics. From 1978 to 1996  he was the first Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics  and was emeritusprofessor of physics from 1996 until his death.Javan sought to be at the scientific forefront  making the next important advance. He oncetold an interviewerwhy he worked so tirelessly to answer difficult and diverse scientific questions: “There is something very beautiful at the end of the line that you're looking for. There's an aesthetic element.” Lila Javan  his daughter  says: “He always wanted to break new ground. For example  he was working very hard on nanotechnology at the end of his career.”Javan was the recipient of numerous awards. In 1993 he was presentedthe Albert Einstein World Medal of Science in recognition for “his more than 30 years of research into the physics of lasers.” In 2006  he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Javan’s original 1960 helium-neon laser device is currentlyon displayat the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History.A passionate  inspiring teacherJavan was a passionate teacher who developed lifelong bonds with generations of students  not only sharing his passion for science but for music and the arts. He wanted students to be well-rounded individuals conversant in more than just physics. As Javan’s former student and colleague Said Nazemi PhD '81  who helped him found Laser Science  Inc.  recalls  “I spent a lot of personal time with him and his family  and knew him not just as a great teacher but as someone with a big sense of humor who also loved classical music and gourmet cooking.”Another of Javan’s associates was Ramachandra Dasari  the associate director of MIT’s George R. Harrison Spectrography Lab  who first came to MIT in 1966. Javan helped shape his entire career  says Dasari: “I became a new person in science because Javan taught me about lasers.” Dasari fondly remembers Javan’s enthusiastic  hands-on approach to pedagogy: “He used to come into the lab often and see what his students were doing with their experiments. He liked to prod and touch things  which made students so nervous  but he just couldn’t help himself.”Javan helped Dasari gain the financial resources to bring his Indian family to the United States in the late 1960s. Dasari notes that he’d been working at MIT for $8 per day (paid by the U.S. Agency for International Development) when Javan helped him obtain a visiting scientist position at MIT that paid $8 000 per year.Dasari recalls one memorable  late-night interaction with Javan. They were seeking to measure a laser’s frequency  something that hadn’t been done before  and they’d been working at the lab for about week. “I was doing the experiment  and finally it succeeded around midnight ” says Dasari  who noted that Javan was resting at home. “I thought to myself  well it’s midnight and I shouldn’t call him at home  but I called him anyway. Lo and behold  he came to the lab at 3 a.m. because he was so excited and wanted to see it for himself.”Javan’s daughter Maia recalls  “He found MIT  and the community of students around him  to be the perfect place for him to grow and flourish. He loved teaching his postdocs  and treated them like part of our family. They’d often have dinner over our house  and then go back to work at the lab. Sharing food and laughter  and enjoying life  that was so important to him.”A doting fatherJavan’s two daughters  Maia and Lila  remember their father as someone with a wide-ranging passion for life  someone brimming with enthusiasms  including science  music  museums  the outdoors  fine food  and more. Javan loved to ride around Cambridge on his bicycle  his daughter Lila Javan recalls  often stopping to buy flowers or chocolate to bring back to his family. “He was a supportive  fun father who was also a great teacher ” she says. “He loved to bring us to his lab  to ‘turn the knobs’ as he liked to say  having us there among his students  and sharing in the fun.”He could be “extraordinarily absent-minded” at times  explains Javan’s daughter Maia: “His mind was always engaged — he loved to think expansively. On many occasions  dad would drive the family car to work at MIT in the morning and then  lost in thought  walk home in the evening  which would take him about 45 minutes  forgetting that he’d left the car parked at work. So we’d remind him  and send him back to MIT on his bicycle to bring the car back home.”Final days: Family  music  and physicsDuring his final days  Javan was surrounded by family and friends in Los Angeles  spending his time “very peacefully ” says daughter Lila. “He was listening to Mahler and Mozart  two of his favorite composers  and having family members read to him from physics journals ” she says.Ali Javan is survived by his daughters Maia and Lila  his grandchildren Valerik and Riva Perelman  and the mother of his children  Marjorie Javan.
Kerson Huang  professor emeritus of physics  dies at 88,MIT Professor Emeritus Kerson Huang  who was well known for his contributions to the field of statistical physics  passed away on Sept. 1 at the age of 88. He had recently been in hospice care at Kaplan House in Danvers  Massachusetts.Born March 15  1928  in Nanning  Kwangsi  China  Huang spent his youth primarily in Manila  Philippines. He received his BS in physics in 1950 and his PhD in 1953  both from MIT. He was one of the most prominent advisees of Austrian-American theoretical physicist Victor Weisskopf. Huang served as an instructor at MIT from 1953 to 1955 before spending two years as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He returned to MIT in 1957 as an assistant professor in physics and was promoted to associate professor in 1961 and to professor in 1966. He was part of the first faculty of the Center for Theoretical Physics (CTP) when it was inaugurated in 1968  and was also a researcher in the Laboratory for Nuclear Science.Together with C. N. Yang  T. D. Lee  and others  Huang contributed to the development of the consistent many-body description of interactions of identical particles such as helium atoms. With Steven Weinberg  Huang showed that the spectrum of strongly interacting particles is so rich that it implies that there is an ultimate temperature above which the description in terms of hadrons breaks down. Together with T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang and separately with Francis Low  Huang wrote important papers on the nature of the weak interaction  especially the way in which then newly-discovered parity violation could be observed experimentally. His books  "Introduction to Statistical Physics" and "Statistical Physics "are widely used throughout the world as fundamental texts in the field.In addition to his many physics accomplishments  Huang was a broadly engaged intellectual who translated Chinese poetry into English and vice versa. His translations include "The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayem: A Rendition in Classical Chinese Quatrains;" "I  Ching  the Oracle;" and "I Ching" (with Rosemary Huang). He also published several books of his own poetry in Chinese.After Huang became a professor emeritus in 1999  he remained with the CTP until 2005 before retiring to Florida. In recent years  he had been a visiting professor at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore.Huang was a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. During his career  he was the recipient of fellowships from the Alfred P. Sloan  John Simon Guggenheim  and Fulbright Foundations.He is survived by his daughter  Kathryn Camille Huang  and by his former wife  Rosemary Huang. Prior to entering hospice  Huang most recently resided in Wakefield  Massachusetts. By his own request  there will be no memorial service.
Family and friends recall Drew Esquivel,At a memorial service for Drew Esquivel in California  a family friend described a photo that reflected the rising MIT senior’s joyful  adventurous spirit.Drew and his friends were jumping off some boulders into a pool  all “getting some good air ” according to Steve Vargas  whose family has been close to Drew’s for many years. High above the others  arms outstretched as if shouting “Cowabunga! ” soared Drew.“He was a go-for-it guy ” Vargas said. “He’d say  ‘Let’s get going.’ ‘I’ll go first.’ ‘We can DO this!’ Drew also had the ability to move others to action and used that wisely to accomplish great things. … We all know he was fiercely competitive  yet he encouraged the success of others and found joy in it.”Drew Esquivel died on July 16  killed by an alleged drunk driver in Brooklyn  New York. Rising MIT junior Sophia Tabchouri  alum James Balchunas '14  and a third friend  Divya Menezes  were all seriously injured.On campus at MIT and at the California memorial service in July  which drew hundreds of people from across the country  those who knew Drew recalled a gifted  fun-loving  and compassionate young man  who shared tight bonds with his family and friends.An “energetic  curious  engaged” studentA native of Healdsburg  California  Drew was majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. He had been living in New York for the summer  working at an internship with the mobile marketing firm Appboy.MIT faculty knew him as a strong student who connected easily with others  in classes  campus life  and on the wrestling club  of which he was an officer and respected leader.“His smiling face and gentle manner is imprinted in my mind ” says Arvind  the Johnson Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT and Drew’s academic advisor. “We used to meet to discuss his course registration every term  and he would tell me what was going on his life. I knew he was keen on wrestling but he did not quite fit my naive model of a wrestler  who I thought ought to look more menacing.”Hari Balakrishnan  the Fujitsu Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  got to know Drew well while teaching him in Course 6.S062 (Mobile and Sensor Computing)  a small class co-taught with Professor Sam Madden  that involved programming for iPhones in XCode.“Drew was a pleasure to talk to and interact with  both in class and during our project meetings through the term ” says Balakrishnan. “He was energetic  curious  engaged. A great team player. Not only smart technically  but he also had the ability to collaborate well with others and communicate ideas well.”In Balakrishnan’s course  Drew’s group developed a location-based  gesture-encrypted messaging application that allowed users to send each other targeted messages based on their locations.Drew also participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) in the Laboratory for Computational Physiology  where he worked on developing electronic medical record systems for underserved areas.In high school  Drew attended the distinguished Summer Science Program in New Mexico. When selected for the prestigious scholarship that would give him a full ride to MIT  Drew told the Healdsburg Tribune  “I have been thinking of college since second grade. I always had a dream school in mind and that made it easy to focus on school.”Athlete and adventurerA member of MIT’s wrestling club  Drew was named most valuable player in 2015 and rookie of the year in 2014. He was team captain  a three-time National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) national qualifier  and a NCWA Northeast conference finalist.In high school  Drew was a varsity swimmer as well as wrestler  and he ran cross-country. He was an Eagle Scout who completed 50-mile hikes with his troop in the High Sierras  and he adventured in the California outdoors with his family and their friends  backpacking  kayaking  and skiing.Drew’s adventurous spirit and strong work ethic led him to scale many summits  both literal and figurative  says his mother  Susanne Esquivel. “He always ‘bagged the peak ’ thought outside the box to solve problems  strove to be the best  found joy in helping others  put family and friends first  and had fun ” she says.Forging bonds at MITDrew was very “deliberate” about where he applied to college  according to Susanne Esquivel  who says he was “really only interested in Stanford or MIT.” He was offered early admission to Stanford  in his home state  but he had also applied for and received a James Family Foundation scholarship  available at the time to a student at his high school  which provided full tuition to a highly competitive  out-of-state school.So  Drew attended MIT’s Campus Preview Weekend and returned “excited and firmly committed to MIT ” Susanne says: “He felt he had found the right environment for learning  competing  and making life-long friends. He was right. He received the best education in the world and took advantage of amazing opportunities and making a difference.”On campus  Drew became very close with his friends  including his fraternity brothers at Lambda Chi Alpha.“I remember meeting Drew at a fraternity event in the fall of 2013. I noticed immediately how lively and happy he was to be there meeting all these new people — his energy was infectious ” said rising senior Zak Psaras  in a eulogy at the memorial service.“As quickly as he bonded with the world around him  he bonded with the city and each of us ” Psaras said  reminiscing about the tight-knit group of friends he and Drew were part of.“Drew knew how to make everyone laugh and would go out of his way to make others feel included  Psaras said. “He never failed to see the good in others. For as comical as Drew was  he always knew when to be serious. If he noticed one of his friends was feeling down  he would be the first to check in. He always went out of his way to make conversation with those who needed it most. When he would ask ‘How's it going  man?’ in the most nonchalant  genuine way possible  you knew he wanted the real answer.“We all deserve to have a Drew in our lives ” Psaras said.Drew is survived by his parents  Susanne and Andrew Esquivel  and his sisters  Elisabeth and Emma  all of Healdsburg  California; his grandfather Donald B. Boyd  PhD of Greenwood  Indiana; and his grandparents Andy and Maria Esquivel of Fremont  Ohio.His parents have established theDrew Esquivel Memorial Scholarship  through the Rotary Club of Healdsburg Sunrise Foundation. This annual  merit-based scholarship will be available to graduates from Healdsburg High School.A July 20 gathering at the MIT chapel also honored Drew. It followed an email sent to the MIT community at the request of MIT President L. Rafael Reif  who was traveling at the time  in which Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart extended MIT’s deepest sympathy to Drew’s family and friends. To the larger circle of the accident victims’ MIT friends and connections  “we join you in your shock and grief ” she wrote. A memorial service for Drew at MIT is planned for early in the fall semester.
Dean Alden Horn  former director of MIT Sea Grant College Program  dies at 95,Dean Alden Horn  a retired U.S. Navy captain  director of MIT Sea Grant College Program from 1976 to 1982  and MIT alumnus  passed away July 13 in North Carolina  where he had lived for the past 25 years. He was 95 years old.Horn had a 27-year distinguished career as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He also oversaw MIT Sea Grant receive its coveted college program status — the first private institution to achieve this — and he was the executive officer for two international Arctic research programs.Born in Hay Springs  Nebraska  on Feb. 19  1921  Horn graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1943. Upon graduation he served as a submarine officer on both the USS Porpoise and the USS Carp  earning a Silver Star medal for “Conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action as Diving Officer of the USS Carp during the First War Patrol of that vessel.” In 1945  Horn began graduate school at MIT in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. After completing his professional engineering degree in 1949  he switched communities to become an engineering duty officer and served at seven different commands throughout his 27-year Naval career. His final two years of active duty were as commanding officer of the Naval Administrative Unit  MIT where he commanded the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) unit and taught the student Naval officers taking the graduate course to become Naval engineers — a rewarding capstone to Horn’s career.In September 1970  Horn accepted the position of executive officer at MIT Sea Grant Program. He was a part of the team that lead MIT Sea Grant to receive college program status  the highest designation available in the Sea Grant network in 1976. Shortly thereafter  Horn was named the Director of MIT Sea Grant  a post he held until July of 1982. In recognition of Horn’s extensive work with undergraduate marine education  his pursuit of excellence  and his tireless application to research  an award was established in his name. TheDean Horn Awardis presented yearly  along with a $1 000 stipend  to an undergraduate student who demonstrates excellence in design and execution of marine research as well as the ability to clearly communicate their results.After leaving MIT Sea Grant  Horn became the executive officer for two international Arctic research programs  MIZEX and CEAREX.In 1992 Horn retired to New Bern  North Carolina  where he lived the rest of his life with his wife  Sharon.It was Horn’s fervent wish and request that  in lieu of flowers  contributions be made to the MIT Dean A. Horn (1949) Award Fund 3626950  or to any charity of your choice.
Professor Emeritus Seymour Papert  pioneer of constructionist learning  dies at 88,Seymour Papert  whose ideas and inventions transformed how millions of children around the world create and learn  died Sunday at his home in East Blue Hill  Maine. He was 88.Papert’s career traversed a trio of influential movements: child development  artificial intelligence  and educational technologies. Based on his insights into children’s thinking and learning  Papert recognized that computers could be used not just to deliver information and instruction  but also to empower children to experiment  explore  and express themselves. The central tenet of hisConstructionisttheory of learning is that people build knowledge most effectively when they are actively engaged in constructing things in the world. As early as 1968  Papert introduced the idea that computer programming and debugging can provide children a way to think about their own thinking and learn about their own learning.“With a mind of extraordinary range and creativity  Seymour Papert helped revolutionize at least three fields  from the study of how children make sense of the world  to the development of artificial intelligence  to the rich intersection of technology and learning ” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “The stamp he left on MIT is profound. Today  as MIT continues to expand its reach and deepen its work in digital learning  I am particularly grateful for Seymour’s groundbreaking vision  and we hope to build on his ideas to open doors to learners of all ages  around the world.”Papert’s life straddled several continents. He was born in 1928 in Pretoria  South Africa  and went on to study at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa  where he earned a BA in philosophy in 1949  followed by a PhD in mathematics three years later. He was a leading anti-apartheid activist throughout his university years.Papert’s studies then took him overseas – first to Cambridge University in England from 1954-1958  where he focused on math research  earning his second PhD  then to the University of Geneva  where he worked with Swiss philosopher and psychologist Jean Piaget  whose theories about the ways children make sense of the world changed Papert’s view of children and learning.From Switzerland  Papert came to the U.S.  joining MIT as a research associate in 1963. Four years later  he became a professor of applied mathematics  and shortly after was appointed co-director of the Artificial Intelligence Lab (which later evolved into theComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  or CSAIL) by its founding director Professor Marvin Minsky. Together  they wrote the 1969 book  “Perceptrons ” which marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence.In 1985  Papert and Minsky joined former MIT President Jerome Wiesner and MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte to become founding faculty members of theMIT Media Lab  where Papert led the Epistemology and Learning research group.“Seymour often talked poetically  sometimes in riddles  like his famed phrase  ‘you cannot think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something ’” says Negroponte  the Media Lab’s co-founder and first director. “He did not follow rules or run by anybody else’s clock. I would say  in Papertian style  Seymour never needed to do what he said because when he said what he did  it was better.”
Judith Tendler  professor emerita in urban studies and planning  dies at 77,Judith Tendler  professor emerita in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP)  passed away on July 24 at the age of 77.Tendler was a development economist with an institutional bent. Starting in 1984  she served as professor of political economy in DUSP's International Development Group.She graduated summa cum laudefrom the University of Michigan  followed by PhD work at Columbia University on a scholarship from the Ford Foundation. Before coming to MIT  she served as a program economist at the U.S. Agency for International Development  first in Rio de Janeiro and then at USAID's Latin America Bureau  carrying out various field evaluations. Following this work she carried out various field-evaluation research studies in Brazil  Bolivia  Ecuador  Costa Rica  Nicaragua  Honduras  South Africa  Bangladesh  India  Kenya  Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles)  and Egypt.At MIT  Tendler ran five comparative research projects in Brazil that combined her field research with teaching  all funded by different Brazilian and international public agencies. These ventures led to various publications  dissertations  and theses. For this work  MIT awarded her two prizes in different years: the Irwin Sizer prize for “the most significant improvement in education at MIT ” and the Class of 1960 Award and Chair for “distinguished contributions to the instructional program and superbly innovative and effective work in educating graduate students under field conditions.”“Judith was among the most innovative and heterodox development economists — and she was a real planner  because she always looked for ways to make incremental changes respecting organizational cultures " says Bish Sanyal  professor and former head of the department. "Her combination of knowledge of development economics and organizational theory had an optimistic outlook: When asked to advise so many governments she always looked first for something positive  then acknowledged the constraints facing the governments  and then proposed something as if those governments were already doing it. We have lost a brilliant mind and a dear friend.”In addition to numerous articles and other works  she published three books: "Good Government in the Tropics " "Inside Foreign Aid " and "Electric Power in Brazil: Entrepreneurship in the Public Sector."Tendler retired from MIT in 2011  and her work and career were celebrated in a widely attended academic festschrift. (To learn more about this special event  and to download many of Judith's writings visit her festschrift page.)A memorial to celebrate her life will be held at MIT this fall.
Robert Fano  computing pioneer and founder of CSAIL  dies at 98,Robert “Bob” Fano  a professor emeritus in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) whose work helped usher in the personal computing age  died in Naples  Florida on July 13. He was 98.During his time on the faculty at MIT  Fano conducted research across multiple disciplines  including information theory  networks  electrical engineering and radar technologies. His work on “time-sharing” — systems that allow multiple people to use a computer at the same time — helped pave the way for the more widespread use of computers in society.Much of his early work in information theory has directly impacted modern technologies. His research with Claude Shannon  for example  spurred data-compression techniques like Huffman coding that are used in today’s high-definition TVs and computer networks.In 1961  Fano and Fernando Corbató  professor emeritus in EECS  developed the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)  one of the earliest time-sharing systems. The success of CTSS helped convince MIT to launch Project MAC  a pivotal early center for computing research for which Fano served as its founding director. Project MAC has since dramatically expanded to become MIT’s largest interdepartmental research lab  the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).“Bob did pioneering work in computer science at a time when many people viewed the field as a curiosity rather than a rigorous academic discipline ” CSAIL Director Daniela Rus says. “None of our work here would have been possible without his passion  insight  and drive."
Arthur Freeman  first associate director of National Magnet Laboratory  dies at 86,Arthur Freeman ’52 PhD ’56  the first associate director of MIT’s National Magnet Laboratory (NML)  passed away on June 7  at the age of 86.Born in Lublin  Poland  in 1930  Freeman arrived in the United States at the age of 7. He studied physics at MIT  both as undergraduate and graduate student  receiving his PhD in 1956 under the supervision of John Slater. After spending time teaching at Brandeis University and working at the U.S. Army Materials Research Agency in Watertown  Massachusetts  he returned to MIT in 1962 to join the newly formed National Magnet Laboratory (NML)  which was under the direction of Benjamin Lax. Freeman arrived in time to see NML move from Building 4 to its current home on Albany Street  where he filled the newly created position of associate director. He was instrumental in bringing to the lab new physicists with backgrounds in superconductivity and magnetism  both theoretical and experimental.Freeman was a solid-state theorist interested in the electronic and magnetic properties of rare-earth and other transition metals. He was well known among solid-state experimentalists for his work on hyperfine interactions in transition metals  organizing an international conference devoted to the topic in 1966.In 1967 he left MIT to become chair of Northwestern University’s physics department  where he made major contributions to the field of computational physics and materials science. He was a pioneer in the development of first-principles quantum simulation methods for complex magnetic and superconducting materials  including their structural  electronic  magnetic  optical and mechanical properties.In 1987 his research brought him to a meeting in New York City to discuss fast-breaking progress in superconductivity. A photograph of Freeman explaining the molecular structure of exciting new high-temperature superconducting materials was published on the front page of the New York Times. The meeting  which attracted thousands of physicists  became known as “the Woodstock of Physics.”Freeman was honored to become the Morrison Professor of Computational Physics in 1992. He became emeritus in 2014  retiring to Brookline  Massachusetts.The many awards and honors he received are a testament to the impact he made on his field. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in Physics  a Fulbright Fellow  an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow  as well as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and afellow of the American Physical Society. He received the first Medal of the Materials Research Society  and the first Magnetism Award of the International Union of Pure and Applied Research. He was the founding editor-in-chief of theJournal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.Freeman is survived by his wife  Doris Caro Freeman; two of his four children  Seth Freeman and Sarah Packer; four grandchildren; two stepchildren  MIT Professor Jeffrey Grossman and Anne Grossman-Bernheimer; and six step-grandchildren.
George W. Rathjens  professor emeritus of political science  dies at 90,George W. Rathjens  a professor emeritus of political science at MIT  died May 27 at age 90.Trained as a chemist  Rathjens received his BS from Yale University and completed his PhD at the University of California at Berkeley. Rathjens is best known for his contributions to the theory and practice of nuclear arms control. He brought a fundamental understanding of the weapons and technologies to policy discussions and was a major participant in the controversial debate in the late 1960s and early 1970s on the wisdom of deploying ballistic missile defenses.Prior to his arrival at MIT  Rathjens had a distinguished career in government  including service at the Institute for Defense Analyses  the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense  the Office of the President's Science Advisor  the Weapons Evaluation Group of the Department of Defense  and the Department of State.Rathjens was one of the founders of MIT’s Security Studies Program — an internationally-recognized graduate-level research and educational program that integrates technical and political analysis of national and international security problems. His major policy interests were nuclear arms issues  environmental problems with special emphasis on conflict and the environment  and post-Cold War international security questions.Among other achievements  Rathjens was from 1998 to 2002 the secretary general of Pugwash  the international non-governmental organization dedicated to cooperation among scientists and officials from many nations to bring "scientific insight and reason to bear" on the risks posed by nuclear weapons. For many years  he had been an active participant in that organization  which won the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize. He was also intensely interested in the principal international security problems of the 1990s — humanitarian intervention  sovereignty  and human rights — and under his leadership Pugwash took up these issues in a series of conferences.Rathjens was active on a number of boards and committees  including theAspen Strategy Groupand the Massachusetts Commission on Nuclear Safety. He served as chair of theCouncil for a Livable Worldand theFederation of American Scientistsand was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. At MIT  Rathjens was held in deep affection by his graduate students and colleagues.Born in Fairbanks  Alaska on June 28  1925  Rathjens developed a great love of the outdoors from an early age. He was an avid hiker  and enjoyed skiing  bicycling  canoeing  and snorkeling. He was also an extremely active squash player  on the court almost every day at MIT  much feared because of his size and reach (though not always victorious). He was a member of the Sierra Club since 1949.Rathjens was predeceased by his wife of 59 years  Lucy van Buttingha Wichers in 2009. He is survived by his three children  Jackie of Danville  California; Leslie of Washington  D.C.; and Peter of Sudbury  Massachusetts; as well as six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.Donations can be made in memory of George Rathjens to: Sierra Club Memorial  2101 Webster St.  Suite 1300  Oakland  CA 94612.
Klaus Biemann  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 89,Chemistry Professor Emeritus Klaus Biemann passed away peacefully on June 2 after a short illness. He was 89.Born in Innsbruck  Austria  in 1926  Biemann studied chemistry at the University of Innsbruck where  in 1951  he received a PhD in organic chemistry under the tutelage of Professor Hermann Bretschneider. On completion of his doctoral studies  he remained at the university in the capacity of instructor until 1955. In 1954  however  he applied for and was accepted into a summer program at MIT for young European scientists and engineers. This Fulbright-backed fellowship enabled him to spend six months of that year in the Department of Chemistry at MIT before returning to Austria. Conversing with passengers on the ship to the U.S.  he “figured out that MIT must be something special ” he later said. He had little knowledge of the Institute  but observed that travelers were highly impressed when they learned that it was his destination.In 1955  Biemann returned to MIT to take up a postdoctoral position as a research assistant in the group of Professor George H. Büchi. His work in the Büchi lab centered on structural problems of natural products  and one of his major projects involved synthesis of muscopyridine for the purpose of proving a structure that Büchi had proposed on biogenetic grounds.In September of 1957  Biemann was appointed to a faculty position in the analytical division of the department by department head Arthur C. Cope. Despite his background in organic synthesis  Biemann centered his research program in analytical chemistry. The project Biemann set for his group was to explore the use of mass spectrometry in the determination of structure of organic compounds including peptides/proteins.A serendipitous event had led Biemann into this area of research. Attending a 1956 Chicago conference on ﬂavors and fragrances while still a research assistant with Büchi  Biemann learned of mass spectrometry from a paper presented by William H. Stahl of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. Biemann saw how  coupled with his synthetic chemistry skills  mass spectrometry might be developed as a powerful tool in his proposed study of peptides. With encouragement and financial support from Cope  he purchased a Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation 21–103C mass spectrometer in 1958 — at that time a workhorse in the petrochemical industry  and a very costly instrument. Cope later told Biemann that the money he had obtained from the MIT administration for Klaus' mass spectrometer was the best investment he [Cope] had ever made.“It was apparent to me ” says Department of Chemistry Professor Emeritus Fred Greene  recalling a conversation with Klaus a few years ago  “that Professor Cope's comment really pleased him. And  indeed  Cope's action made a huge difference to the field of mass spectrometry  to the department  and to Klaus.""On a personal note ” Greene continues  “Klaus was such a gracious person. And a thoughtful person. It was a real gift to me to have had these interactions with him in our shared emeritus office  18-297.”Six years later  Biemann’s graduate students and and postdocs began teaching themselves FORTRAN in order to design spectral interpretation algorithms. A 15-foot wide IBM 1800 computer quickly became a very important part of the Biemann laboratory. The groundwork for a new field in biochemistry — proteomics — had been laid.“With Klaus Biemann’s passing  science has lost a true hero ” says Harry S. Hertz  former graduate student in the Biemann lab and director of the Baldridge Performance Excellence Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “When each of us joined Klaus’ research group  we quickly learned that we had joined something extraordinary. Klaus was a great mentor; he challenged us to imagine and ‘strongly encouraged’ us to deliver. It was a special time for each of us. We discovered the excitement of scientific research and the power of collaboration. We were truly a research group. But what made it even more special was Klaus  the person. He was a man who taught us about scientific integrity and brought the highest regard for each of us as a person to our interactions with him and each other. We achieved because we were in an environment of greatness  with Klaus as our guide.”Ultimately  150 graduate students and postdocs would benefit from Biemann’s tutelage and mentorship  and hundreds more are his professional progeny through the many of his direct descendents who undertook academic careers  largely inspired by his example and leadership. They represent the core of the worldwide mass spectrometry community.“With his students and postdocs  Klaus was simultaneously formal  demanding  infallibly supportive  and an unfailing source of good humor ” says John Hayes  a former graduate student and scientist emeritus of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. “He inspired do-or-die effort and respect that came from the heart as well as the mind. Among his many honors  this may be the greatest.”Another graduate student from the Biemann lab  Ron Hites  distinguished professor at Indiana University  says the following about his PhD advisor: “Klaus taught all of us who passed through his research group how to do research and  more importantly  how to communicate our work — keep to a simple story and focus on the big picture. ... He was always supportive and courteous. I owe him a lot.”Rising through the ranks  Biemann was appointed to assistant professor in 1959  associate professor in 1962  and full professor in 1963. Regarded as the father of organic mass spectrometry  his approach over the years enabled him to solve many problems in protein structure not amenable to existing methods.Catherine Costello  the William F. Warren Distinguished Professor and director of the Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry at Boston University  who was a colleague of Biemann for more than 20 years at MIT  points out: “His impact on engaging scientists in adjacent fields to utilize mass spectrometry resulted from his constant outreach to other chemists  to biologists and to those in the medical professions  to identify areas of research where mass spectrometry could make a novel and unique contributions and to drive the development of mass spectrometry systems to accommodate those needs. He set up the first NIH Research Resource in 1966  to make these techniques available to the community and this center continued to lead technological developments and applications for 30 years.”“The revolution in mass spectrometry that has made it one of the most important tools not only in chemistry but also in biology owes everything to the pioneering work of Klaus Biemann ” says Greg Petsko  the Gyula and Katica Tauber Professor of Biochemistry and Chemistry Emeritus at Brandeis University and adjunct professor in the Department of Neurology and Center for Neurologic Diseases at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. “He made analytical chemistry  which had been relegated to a minor role as a servant of organic synthesis  once again a central part of the discipline. On a personal note  he was kind  generous  and constantly supportive of young scientists. A true gentleman scholar.”Among the first entire proteins to be sequenced in this way by the Biemann group was the light-responsive protein bacteriorhodopsin  in collaboration with Professor H. Gobind Khorana  and an aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase enzyme important in the process of building up a protein one amino acid at a time.In 1976  Biemann led a scientific team that sent a miniaturized mass spectrometer to Mars as part of the Viking Mission to look for organic compounds at the surface of the Red Planet. Mass spectrometry on lunar material returned by the Apollo missions had earlier been conducted in Biemann’s lab in the basement of Building 56. Biemann described his decades of participation in what is commonly called space research  beginning in 1963  as quite unrelated to his other organic and biochemical work. “However ” he stated in theAnnual Review of Analytical Chemistry “it required expertise in organic mass spectrometry  and I felt I should get involved.” He ironically described it as “scientific charity ” but also remarked it was an unforgettable experience. This he largely attributed to Viking’s unique team environment and the mutual appreciation that developed over the years of planning  and then being together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the landed mission among the scientists of various disciplines  all working toward a common goal  the understanding of our neighboring planet.“Klaus was a world-class scientist and inventor  a pioneer whose contributions highlight how technological innovation enables scientific advancement ” says Timothy Jamison  head of the Department of Chemistry  on learning of Biemann’s passing.Biemann’s many awards and honors include the 2007 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Chemistry  the Thomson Medal from the International Mass Spectrometry Foundation (1991)  the first Field and Franklin Award in Mass Spectrometry from the American Chemical Society (1986)  the Fritz Pregl Medal of the Austrian Microchemical Society (1977)  the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal from NASA (1977)  and the Stas Medal of the Belgian Chemical Society (1962). He was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1993 and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. He authored over 350 scientific publications and a book  "Mass Spectrometry: Organic Chemical Applications" (1962). The American Society of Mass Spectrometry annually recognizes an early-career scientist’s mass spectrometry achievements with the bestowal of the Biemann Medal.Biemann and his wife Vera  who predeceased him in 2008  and their children Hans-Peter and Betsy  were faculty residents at McCormick Hall from 1967 to 1971.Services will be private with immediate family. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to “Science Scholarship” and sent to Trustees of Trust Fund  P.O. Box 608  Alton  NH 03809. Biemann had a home in Alton and had established this fund for students of Prospect Mountain High School who are interested in embarking on a career in science.
Willem Malkus  professor emeritus of mathematics  dies at 92,Willem Van Rensselaer Malkus  emeritus professor of mathematics at MIT  died in Falmouth  Massachusetts  on Saturday May 28  at the age of 92. He was a professor of applied mathematics at MIT from 1969 until his retirement in 1996.Malkus was a physical applied mathematician who focused on problems in thermal convection  magnetohydrodynamics  and geophysical fluid dynamics. A pioneer in fluid dynamics  he inspired students and colleagues alike to delve deeply into the important problems of his time.As a graduate student  Willem worked with the preeminent physicist Enrico Fermi  who convinced him to begin his research career by trying to discover magnetic monopoles. While this was a risky and ultimately unsuccessful venture  it left Malkus with an abiding skepticism that he put to good use throughout his career. Following graduate school  Malkus left particle physics and turned his attention to a more tangible subject — fluid mechanics  where he was particularly interested in its geophysical applications.Malkus made fundamental contributions to the theory of thermal convection  turbulence  magnetohydrodynamics  elliptical flows  and their applications in geophysics. He was particularly focused on the magnetic dynamo problem  as concerns the manner in which the motion of an electrically conducting fluid can generate a magnetic field. In 1968  he proposed a novel theory for a precessionally-forced geodynamo  well known to workers in the field.
Sergeant John Carr  25-year MIT Police veteran  dies at 52 ,Sergeant John Carr of the MIT Police  who began his quarter-century career serving MIT in September 1991  died Sunday  May 22  at Salem Hospital  following a long struggle with cancer. He was 52.For much of his tenure  Carr was a patrol officer on the main campus  working the evening shift. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant on March 14. His colleagues remember him as dedicated and dependable  and as someone who never hesitated to assist others  whether MIT students  staff  or his police colleagues.“Sergeant Carr was a reliable officer  and always there to provide calm leadership ” says Administrative Captain Cheryl Vossmer of the MIT Police.A Beverly  Massachusetts  resident who was born in Seoul  South Korea  Carr worked to forge connections with the people and communities he served. For example  he often participated in “meet and greet” events with MIT students. He was also a licensed emergency medical technician (EMT)  a firearms instructor  and a member of the American Society of Law Enforcement Training.Carr received the MIT Police Medal of Valor in 2007 for displaying heroism and “going above and beyond the call of duty.” During his career with the MIT Police  Carr received two letters of commendation for heroic acts. In one instance  in 2000  Carr responded to a fire at an MIT dorm that housed 93 students; he  along with six of his MIT Police colleagues  helped put out the blaze with fire extinguishers. He and his colleagues were later transported to local hospitals for smoke inhalation.Carr served in the U.S. Army  187th Infantry Brigade  and then continued his military service for two decades in the U.S. Army Reserve. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army Reserve  with the rank of major.Carr held an associate’s degree in criminal justice from Valley Forge Military College in Pennsylvania  a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Massachusetts at Boston  and a master’s degree in criminal justice from Ashwood University in Florida.A visitation and wake will be held Friday  May 27  at Campbell’s Funeral Home in Beverly  from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.; a funeral service will follow on Saturday  May 28  at St. Mary’s Star of the Sea Church in Beverly at 10 a.m.Carr is survived by his father  George W.

Prominent MIT economist and dean Lester Thurow dies at 77,The influential MIT economist and public intellectual Lester Thurow  whose work addressed the many consequences of an increasingly global economy  died on Friday at his home in Westport  Massachusetts. Thurow  who also served as dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management  was 77 years old.Having focused on income distribution early in his scholarly career  Thurow broadened his interests over time and became a leading public voice examining many of the defining features of globalization  including the competitiveness of national economies at a time of industrial change  and the welfare of workers  including those affected by the shift of jobs around the world.In many years of engagement with the public and government officials — and in a series of bestselling books — Thurow advocated a distinctive set of policy ideas that defied simple political labeling. He supported policies that would help society and corporations make long-term investments in research in order to spur growth. At the same time  in his writings and public lectures  he also emphasized the importance of education for all  contending that it would help workers in a rapidly evolving and technologizing world.The connecting thread in all of Thurow’s work  by his own account  was a straightforward and idealistic impulse: He wanted “to make the world better ” as he toldFortunemagazine in 1987  soon after assuming the Sloan deanship."Lester Thurow spent his life trying to make society more farsighted and more fair ” said MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “As a member of the faculty  as dean of MIT Sloan  as a successful author  and as an advisor to political giants  he embodied MIT’s mission to advance knowledge and educate students in service to the nation and the world. He left an indelible mark in the world of economic policy  and his pioneering instinct for building connections with people  institutions  and ideas around the world is woven deep into the daily life of MIT.”Into the public sphereThurow was born in Livingston  Montana  in 1938  and grew up in the state  where his father was a Methodist minister. Thurow worked in the local copper mines for four summers as a young man  but as an excellent student soon found himself on a fast academic track. He received his BA in political economy from Williams College  won a Rhodes Scholarship  and earned a master’s in philosophy  politics  and economics (PPE) from Balliol College of Oxford University.After Oxford  he received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1964  where he subsequently started his teaching career. Thurow moved to MIT in 1968 and remained at the Institute thereafter  with appointments in both the Department of Economics and in Sloan.Highly active as both an administrator and faculty member  Thurow served as dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management from 1987 to 1993; he also held a chaired faculty position as the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Professor of Management and Economics Emeritus.Thurow’s work was marked by a career-long commitment to public engagement. In addition to writing his widely read books  he advised presidential candidates and maintained a decades-long dialogue with policymakers.By Thurow’s account  his interest in bringing economics to the public sphere was intensified in the 1970s  when he failed to land a position in the Carter Administration and chose to influence economic discussion through other avenues.“I decided that if I could not have the king’s ear  I would talk to the public ” Thurow toldThe New York Timesin 1997. “That’s the other way to have an impact on the economic system.”Thurow’s books for general audiences in the 1990s are among his most widely read. These include “Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan  Europe  and America” (1992)  which surveyed the post-Cold War economic landscape and suggested that investment and education would be keys to renewing developed economies; “The Future of Capitalism: How Today’s Economic Forces Shape Tomorrow’s World” (1996); and “Building Wealth: The New Rules for Individuals  Companies  and Nations in a Knowledge-Based Economy.”Over time  Thurow maintained the view that a series of sensible policy decisions could produce a globalized economy that would be fairer to all parties  from management to employees.“There is no silver bullet  but there are many things that we can do to make globalization more inclusive than it would be if we just sat back and let it happen ” Thurow toldCIOmagazine in a 2003 interview.Institution buildingIn concert with his view that the U.S. could help shape globalization in productive ways  Thurow worked vigorously over an extended period of time to help forge MIT’s relationships with the wider world. In particular  he helped develop MIT Sloan’s programs in China.“Lester did not simply serve the School and the Institute  nor did he simply serve the field of economics; he was a visionary with the foresight to develop long-lasting and deeply meaningful relationships that united Chinese educational institutions together with MIT Sloan as the barriers between East and West began to crumble ” said David Schmittlein  John C Head III Dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management  in a statement released to the Sloan community.“In partnership with our faculty and alumni ” Schmittlein added  “Lester made major progress in the development of Sloan’s international presence  and in particular the MIT-China Management Education Project.”Thurow is survived by his wife  Anni; his brother  Chuck; his sons  Torben and Ethan  and daughters-in-law  Kornelia and Ina; his step-children  Yaron and Yael; and his seven grandchildren.Plans for a celebration of Lester’s life are forthcoming.
Frank Perkins  professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering  dies at 82,Frank E. Perkins  professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering and former associate provost and dean for graduate education at MIT  died March 5 at age 82 following a long struggle with Parkinson’s disease.The son of Frank Hall Perkins and Ethel (Newsome) (Perkins) Knight  Perkins was a 1951 graduate of Brockton High School  in Brockton  Massachusetts  where he served on the student Executive Committee and received the Edwin P. Linfield scholarship. He later attended MIT  where he earned bachelor’s (1955)  master’s (1959)  and ScD (1966) degrees  all in the field of civil engineering.With the exception of two years’ active duty with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — much of which was spent supervising airfield construction in Greenland — the major portion of Perkins’ career was spent at MIT  where he was appointed to the faculty in 1966. He subsequently served as head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; associate provost; and  for 12 years  as dean for graduate education. His principal research and teaching interests were in the areas of hydraulics  hydrology  and water resource analysis  with special emphasis on the development of computer models.  He also conducted research on water resources development in several South American countries  and on issues of dam safety in the United States.Perkins took a particular interest in the improvement of teaching at MIT and was instrumental in creating an annual teacher-training workshop for graduate student teaching assistants. By his admission  his proudest achievement was his receipt  in 1965  of MIT’s Goodwin Medal  which is given annually in recognition of “conspicuously effective teaching by a member of the graduate student teaching staff.”While serving as dean for graduate education  he was active in the Association of Graduate Schools (AGS) in the Association of American Universities  and served for one term as the AGS national president. In 1995  Perkins was honored by MIT’s graduate students through their creation of theFrank E. Perkins Award for Excellence in Graduate Advising  which is given each year to a professor who has served as an excellent advisor and mentor for graduate students.In 1977  Perkins served on the National Research Council’s Committee on the Safety of Dams and was chair of the Federal Dam Safety Independent Review Panel in 1978. He was president of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers Section (BSCES) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 1981  and served on its board of directors from 1978 until 1983. He played an important role in the creation of Boston Society of Civil Engineers’ Computer Division and ASCE’s Management Division. In 1982  and again in 1992  he received BSCES’s Ralph W. Horne Award  which recognizes unpaid public service.In addition to his active roles in ASCE  BSCES  and AGS  Perkins was at various times an active member of the International Association for Hydraulic Research  the American Water Resources Association  and the American Geophysical Union. He served on the Board of Visitors to the Air Force Institute of Technology  the Board of Foster Wheeler Corporation  and the Board of Managers of the Evanswood Center for Older Adults.Perkins chaired the Brockton Conservation Commission for a period of five years (1972-77) and later  from 1996 to 2003  served as chair of the City of Brockton’s state-mandated Water Commission. Under his leadership of these commissions  the city made significant progress through the purchase of three parcels of conservation land and expanded the system’s safe yield through addition of a modern desalination plant.Known to many of his friends as “Ed ” Perkins spent most of his life as a resident of Brockton. Since 2004  he and his wife of 59 years  Geraldine “Gerry” (Gurney) Perkins  had lived in the Stone Meadow community of Bridgewater. He was a lifelong member of the First Baptist Church of Brockton  where he served as deacon  trustee  youth adviser  and participant in numerous other ad hoc activities.In addition to his wife  Perkins is survived by his son  David  daughter-in-law Jennifer Ramsey  and their children  Zoe  Max  and Lucy of Kensington  New Hampshire; and son James and his daughter  Olivia  of Avon  New York. He is also survived by a sister  Betty Gilson of Bridgewater  Massachusetts; a brother  Robert Perkins of Lakeville  Massachusetts; and numerous nieces and nephews.Visitation will be held on Friday  March 18  from 4 to 7 p.m. at the Dahlborg-MacNevin Funeral Home  647 Main Street  Brockton. A memorial service will be held on Saturday  March 19 at 10 a.m. at the First Baptist Church of Brockton  256 Forest Avenue  Brockton. Interment will take place at Pine Hill Cemetery  West Bridgewater  immediately following the funeral service.In lieu of flowers  individuals are invited to contribute to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation  1359 Broadway  Suite 1509  New York  NY 10018.
John Wyatt  longtime MIT professor and cofounder of Boston Retinal Implant Project  dies at 69,John Wyatt ’68  who served as a professor of electrical engineering for 36 years  passed away at home in the company of his family on Wednesday  Feb. 3. He was 69.Wyatt was a devoted researcher who spent decades developing retinal implants to restore sight to people affected by age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa  the two leading causes of blindness worldwide. An expert in circuits  his work focused on developing a chip that could be implanted in the retina to transmit visual information to the optic nerve.A native of Nashville  Tennessee  Wyatt received a BS from MIT in 1968  an MS from Princeton University 1970  and a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 1979  all in electrical engineering. He joined the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) faculty in 1979  and retired from MIT in June 2015.Wyatt was a driven researcher who pursued big ideas. In 1989  he cofounded the Boston Retinal Implant Project with Joseph Rizzo of the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary  where he led the engineering team. Their group was the first to use microfabricated electrode arrays to electrically stimulate the human retina. Wyatt and Rizzo also cofounded Bionic Eye Technologies  which is working to commercialize their work to help the blind.Their prosthetic design uses a camera embedded in a pair of glasses worn by the user to “see.” The camera then transmits visual information to a chip embedded in the retina  with the goal of restoring enough sight that a user might be able to find a door in a room  or walk down the street without the aid of a cane.More recent advances in microfabrication and packaging made by their team led to the development of a prosthetic with the largest number of individually-controllable stimulation channels of any neural prosthetic  an advance that could allow a substantially greater level of vision to be obtained.“I said  that sounds really like science fiction. I spent about three months trying to think about why it couldn’t be done  and I really couldn’t find a reason it couldn’t be done ” Wyatt remembered about his reaction to the implant’s concept in a 2012 video. “So I said  ‘OK  I’ll give it a shot ’ and I’ve been at it for 23 years.”Wyatt did his first research on the retina during his graduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley  in the lab of Professor Frank Werblin. His doctoral dissertation included a study of how circuits could be used to model forces and flows in biological processes  and he developed this work further during his postdoctoral work at the Medical College of Virginia.In 1990  Wyatt was appointed EECS's first Adler Scholar. Named for Richard B. Adler  a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a friend of Wyatt’s  the appointment allows MIT faculty to take a class for one semester as a student.In an article about the Adler Scholar program published the same year The New York Timesdescribed Wyatt’s delight at the chance to be a student again: “I don't want to be a research supervisor particularly. I want to be a researcher." He enrolled in 6.866 (Machine Vision)  a course taught by Berthold K.P. Horn.In 1998 the Retinitis Pigmentosa International Foundation awarded him the Jules Stein Living Tribute Award.“John devoted his research to improving the quality of life for millions of people affected by blindness ” wrote David Perreault  associate department head of EECS  in an email to faculty. “He will be long remembered by the many colleagues  students  and patients whose lives he touched.”Wyatt is survived by his wife  Christie Baxter; his daughter  Julia Wyatt; and stepson Andrew Cook  all of Sudbury; and his brother James Wyatt and nephew Timothy Wyatt  both of Berlin  Germany.A funeral service for Wyatt will be held on Tuesday  Feb. 9  at 11 a.m. at the First Parish Church in Sudbury  Massachusetts. Calling hours will be the previous evening  Monday  Feb. 8  from 5 to 8 p.m.  at the Duckett Funeral Home in Sudbury.
Marvin Minsky  “father of artificial intelligence ” dies at 88,Marvin Minsky  a mathematician  computer scientist  and pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence  died at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital on Sunday  Jan. 24  of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 88.Minsky  a professor emeritus at the MIT Media Lab  was a pioneering thinker and the foremost expert on the theory of artificial intelligence. His 1985 book “The Society of Mind” is considered a seminal exploration of intellectual structure and function  advancing understanding of the diversity of mechanisms interacting in intelligence and thought. Minsky’s last book  “The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking  Artificial Intelligence  and the Future of the Human Mind ” was published in 2006.Minsky viewed the brain as a machine whose functioning can be studied and replicated in a computer — which would teach us  in turn  to better understand the human brain and higher-level mental functions: How might we endow machines with common sense — the knowledge humans acquire every day through experience? How  for example  do we teach a sophisticated computer that to drag an object on a string  you need to pull  not push — a concept easily mastered by a two-year-old child?"Very few people produce seminal work in more than one field; Marvin Minksy was that caliber of genius " MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. "Subtract his contributions from MIT alone and the intellectual landscape would be unrecognizable: without CSAIL  without the Media Lab  without the study of artificial intelligence and without generations of his extraordinarily creative students and protégés. His curiosity was ravenous. His creativity was beyond measuring. We can only be grateful that he made his intellectual home at MIT.”A native New Yorker  Minsky was born on Aug. 9  1927  and entered Harvard University after returning from service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After graduating from Harvard with honors in 1950  he attended Princeton University  receiving his PhD in mathematics in 1954. In 1951  his first year at Princeton  he built the first neural network simulator.Minsky joined the faculty of MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1958  and co-founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (now theComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) the following year. At the AI Lab  he aimed to explore how to endow machines with human-like perception and intelligence. He created robotic hands that can manipulate objects  developed new programming frameworks  and wrote extensively about philosophical issues in artificial intelligence.“Marvin Minsky helped create the vision of artificial intelligence as we know it today ” says CSAIL Director Daniela Rus  the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “The challenges he defined are still driving our quest for intelligent machines and inspiring researchers to push the boundaries in computer science.”Minsky was convinced that humans will one day develop machines that rival our own intelligence. But frustrated by a shortage of both researchers and funding in recent years  he cautioned  “How long this takes will depend on how many people we have working on the right problems.”In 1985  Minsky became a founding member of the MIT Media Lab  where he was named the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences  and where he continued to teach and mentor until recently.Professor Nicholas Negroponte  co-founder and chairman emeritus of the Media Lab  says: “Marvin talked in riddles that made perfect sense  were always profound and often so funny that you would find yourself laughing days later. His genius was so self-evident that it defined ‘awesome.’ The Lab bathed in his reflected light.”In addition to his renown in artificial intelligence  Minsky was a gifted pianist — one of only a handful of people in the world who could improvise fugues  the polyphonic counterpoint that distinguish Western classical music. His influential 1981 paper “Music  Mind and Meaning” illuminated the connections between music  psychology  and the mind.Other achievements include Minsky’s role as the inventor of the earliest confocal scanning microscope. He was also involved in the inventions of the first “turtle ” or cursor  for the LOGO programming language  with Seymour Papert  and the “Muse” synthesizer for musical variations  with Ed Fredkin.Minsky received the world’s top honors for his pioneering work and mentoring role in the field of artificial intelligence  including the A.M. Turing Award — the highest honor in computer science — in 1969.In addition to the Turing Award  Minsky received honors over the years including the Japan Prize; the Royal Society of Medicine’s Rank Prize (for Optoelectronics); the Optical Society of America’s R.W. Wood Prize; MIT’s James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award; the Computer Pioneer Award from IEEE Computer Society; the Benjamin Franklin Medal; and  in 2014  the Dan David Foundation Prize for the Future of Time Dimension titled “Artificial Intelligence: The Digital Mind ” and the BBVA Group’s BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Lifetime Achievement Award.Minsky is survived by his wife  Gloria Rudisch Minsky  MD  and three children: Henry  Juliana  and Margaret Minsky. The family requests that memorial contributions be directed to the Marvin Minsky Foundation  which supports research in artificial intelligence  including support for graduate students.A celebration of Minsky’s life will be held at the MIT Media Lab later this year.
Professor Stanford Anderson dies at 81   ,Stanford Anderson  professor of history and architecture and a former head of the Department of Architecture died on Jan. 5. He was 81.One of the country’s leading architectural historians  Anderson joined the faculty in 1963 for an extraordinary career at MIT that spanned more than 50 years. His research and writing concerned architectural theory  early modern architecture in northern Europe  American architecture and urbanism  and epistemology and historiography. But Anderson’s profound contributions as an author and intellectual  his colleagues say  are matched by his influence on MIT and how he formed the department’s shape and stature today.“Stanford's contributions over the past 50 years were enormous. He was a distinguished professor  significant scholar  generous mentor  and the long-term intellectual consciousness of the department ” says J. Meejin Yoon  professor and head of the Department of Architecture. “Many of us  directly or indirectly  are deeply indebted to his stewardship  generosity  and legacy.”Anderson served as head of the Department of Architecture for 13 years  from 1991 through 2004  as well as chair of the joint Harvard/MIT Aga Khan Program Committee from 1992-99. In 1974  he co-founded the department’s History  Theory and Criticism (HTC) Program with architectural historian Henry Millon and art historians Wayne Andersen and Rosalind Krauss  then directed the program from 1974-91 and again in 1995-96. Under his leadership  HTC grew to have an unusually large impact on the field  given its modest size."Stan Anderson was a historian and historiographer  a critical interlocutor of contemporary practice  and most notably an educator’s educator " says Hashim Sarkis  dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. "His leadership of the History  Theory and Criticism discipline group made MIT one of the strongest bastions of architectural history in the world and has graduated generations of preeminent historians and theorists whose impact on the field continues to grow. His legacy is unmatched."Anderson authored numerous articles and books. With his book  "Eladio Dieste: Innovation in Structural Art" (2004  Princeton Architectural Press)  the first comprehensive analysis of Dieste’s work to be published in English  he helped to secure a place in history for one of the lesser-known geniuses of 20th-century architecture and engineering. In "Peter Behrens and a New Architecture for the Twentieth Century" (2000  MIT Press) he assimilated decades of research into a nuanced  definitive work on one of the emblematic figures in the development of architectural modernism.According to one of his former students  current MIT Professor Mark Jarzombek  “Stanford Anderson championed an approach to design that was not a one-off  but that could stand the test of time as a research activity that allowed multiple factors and issues to be taken into consideration.”In 1997  in testament to his effect on those around him  Anderson’s former students produced a book of essays in his honor: "The Education of the Architect: Historiography  Urbanism and the Growth of Knowledge" (MIT Press). During his career  he also received MIT's Graduate Student Teaching Award in 1989 and the King Fahd Award for Design and Research in Islamic Architecture  1985-86.In 2004  he received the prestigious Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education from the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Architects and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. The Topaz Medallion honors an individual who has made outstanding contributions to architectural education  whose teaching has influenced a range of students  and who has broadly impacted architectural education over a long career.“Stan always understood how transformative it would be on both sides — the critical perspective of history being brought into focus for designers and the feedback of living design problems being brought to bear on the practice of academic historians ” said Caroline Jones  a professor and current director of the HTC Program  at Anderson’s retirement in 2014. “This little PhD program changed what it meant to be an architect coming out of MIT. It also raised the bar for how architecture schools elsewhere needed to train tomorrow’s designers.”Anderson is survived by his wife of 32 years  Nancy Royal  and by daughter Kimberly Mims; son Teague Mims; daughter-in-law Martina Mims; granddaughter Karolina Mims; grandson Marek Mims; and by his brother  Charles Anderson  and his wife  Margaret; niece Kristen Kalbrener; and nephews Mark and Peter Anderson.A memorial service for Anderson will be held Feb. 26 in MIT's Kresge Chapel beginning at 3 p.m. A reception will follow. Donations in his memory can be made to MIT Department of Architecture.For any questions about the memorial service  contact Anne Deveau at (617) 258-8438.
Sean Perry  technical associate at the Picower Institute  dies at age 39,Sean Perry  a technical associate at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory  died suddenly in his hometown of Mattapoisett  Massachusetts  on Monday  Nov. 23. He was 39.For over 15 years  Perry worked in the laboratory of Susumu Tonegawa  the Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience at MIT. As a senior lab member  he was relied on for his expertise in a wide range of subjects  including IT support and data management  immunohistochemistry  molecular biology  imaging and microscopy  and animal handling and management. Perry's colleagues describe him as a patient and skilled teacher and coach  and say that he was responsible for training new lab members in fundamental skills. Lab alumni from around the world would come to him for advice  they say.“What struck me most about Sean was that he was a lifelong learner ” Tonegawa says. “Through his own initiative and intelligence  Sean mastered and took on a wide range of crucial roles in the lab  in particular maintenance of the lab’s servers and upkeep of advanced light microscopy equipment. We depended on him greatly these past years. The loss of his intellectual curiosity and kindness will leave an unfillable absence in my lab  and in the lives of those who knew him.”Originally from Mattapoisett  Perry graduated from Old Rochester Regional High School and obtained an associate’s degree in culinary arts/chef training from Bristol Community College and a BS in biology with honors from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. After spending two years in the Tonegawa lab  Perry spent a year in Amsterdam in the laboratory of Christiaan Levelt at the Ophthalmic Research Institute (now the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience) before returning to MIT.Perry excelled in a variety of pursuits outside of work  including power boating  sailing  and fishing. In his first year in the North Atlantic Shark Tournament  he was on the team of the Beagle  which finished in first place. He was also an accomplished competitive marksman  placing in the top five among New England marksmen in two separate competitions this past year. Perry was a former on-call firefighter in Mattapoisett  and plowed snow for the Mattapoisett Highway Department. His other pastimes included photography  playing piano  working with animals  welding  and metal sculpting.“Sean knew so much about so many different topics  in and outside of the lab ” says Jennie Young  Perry’s friend and a research scientist in the Tonegawa lab. “People were asking him for advice all the time  on everything from cooking to DIY home improvement projects — and he was always happy to give it. I think everything came so naturally to him that it was easy for him to answer people's questions or to give advice.”In addition to his parents  Diane and Dennis Perry  and his sister  Laura Perry  Perry is survived by his colleague and cousin  Candy Carr  his godparents  Kathy Carr and David Perry  and his uncle  Andy Carr  as well as an extended family of aunts  uncles  and cousins.Family and friends will be received on Friday  Dec. 4  from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. at the Saunders-Dwyer Funeral Home at 50 County Rd. in Mattapoisett. A memorial service will be held on Saturday  Dec. 5  at 9:30 a.m. at the funeral home  with burial following in Cushing Cemetery in Mattapoisett. Remembrances may be made in Perry’s name to a charity of the donor's choice.
Alan Davison  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 79,Professor Emeritus Alan Davison  a fellow of the Royal Society who elevated the art of inorganic chemical synthesis in his laboratories at MIT for more than four decades  died Saturday  Nov. 14  at the age of 79 after a long illness.Davison carried out his undergraduate studies in chemistry at the University of Swansea in Wales receiving a BS in 1959  followed by a PhD in 1962 in inorganic chemistry from Imperial College London under Nobel laureate Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson. Wilkinson was renowned for having pioneered inorganic chemistry and homogeneous transition metal catalysis.After two years working as a chemistry instructor at Harvard University  Davison joined the Department of Chemistry at MIT in 1964 as an assistant professor in inorganic chemistry. By 1974  he had risen through the ranks of tenure to full professor.“I first met Alan when he joined the MIT faculty where I was a second-year graduate student in Al Cotton's lab ” says Stephen Lippard  the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry. “He was a great source of practical knowledge  a man with a wonderful sense of humor  and a kind and patient mentor to me and many other graduate students. We maintained close contact over many decades  published together when I was at Columbia and then later at MIT  and remained friends for over five decades.”Throughout his illustrious career  Davison made research contributions spanning organometallic  boron  coordination  and bioinorganic chemistries. He was a serial innovator whose numerous seminal discoveries in diverse areas provided starting points for generations of followers. “His contributions to synthetic inorganic and medicinal chemistry were legion ” Lippard adds. “He will be greatly missed.”“Alan was part of my life starting in 1967 and was involved in providing me with the opportunity to come to MIT in 1975 ” remarks Richard Schrock  the Frederick G. Keyes Professor of Chemistry. “He became my friend  colleague  and mentor.”Davison will be immortalized for his work with octahedral homoleptic isocyanide complexes of technetium(I). In collaboration with the late Professor Alun G. Jones  professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School  he brought rational synthetic understanding of technetium chemistry to the field of nuclear medicine. Davison and Jones’ efforts included development of the first technetium-based myocardial perfusion-imaging agent  Cardiolite  an important tool in clinical nuclear cardiology."Alan Davison was an intuitive chemical genius who was gifted from an early age with magic hands in the laboratory " says Christopher Cummins  the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Chemistry. “He had a photographic memory  a sharp wit  and an unusually deep understanding of people combined with compulsive empathy. He was also an amazing storyteller. This set of traits is seldom combined in a single individual  but their coexistence in the person of Alan Davison explains why the many students for whom he served selflessly as unofficial mentor were so drawn to him and so valued his wisdom and insights."Former graduate student Chris Orvig PhD ’81 remembers a particularly significant afternoon. It was the day he first met with Davison to be his teaching assistant  and Davison told him about his research project on the “new element” technetium. “I was hooked … for life ” Orvig says. “Alan’s breadth of knowledge in chemistry and his unselfish devotion to graduate students (both his own and those of other faculty) were legendary. He always had time to encourage and mentor — I was privileged to share a few years with him ” he says  adding  “I use the lessons of patience and understanding that I learned from him every day of my life.”“Alan Davison's mentorship had a profound effect on his many students and postdocs ” says former Davison group member Mike Abrams PhD ’83. “His brilliance and chemical insight matched with humor and compassion were a precious gift to all of us.”Throughout his illustrious career  Davison received many awards  including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship (1967); the Paul C. Aebersold Award for Outstanding Achievement in Basic Science Applied to Nuclear Medicine (1993); the Ernest H. Swift Lectureship at Caltech (1999); the American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention (2006); the Carothers Award for outstanding contributions and advances in industrial applications of Chemistry (2006); the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award in Biotechnology and Medicine (2006); and the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Georg Charles de Hevesy Nuclear Pioneer Award (2009).Former graduate student Jim Kronauge PhD '87 noted: “As well as having been an intuitive and enlightening chemist  Alan was also extremely modest. He never lobbied for any of the major awards he received  and did not think he had done anything special to deserve them. Alan was most proud of the students’ teaching awards  and of course his admission to the Royal Society. Those accolades  he felt  were the most benevolent recognition by the people he loved.”On June 17  2005  at a party held in his honor  attended by his many colleagues and former students  Davison was presented with a 20” x 20” bronze plaque bearing a description of his remarkable career. The plaque is mounted outside his old office on the 4th floor of Building 6.Alan Davison is survived by his wife of 21 years  Lynne Davison of North Falmouth  Massachusetts; his children  Jackie  Fiona  Robert  Erin  Myles  Rowena and Ian; 16 grandchildren  and three great-grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to theAlan Davison Fellowship Fund (#3296290)in his memory. Checks should be made payable to MIT and mailed to Liz McGrath  MIT Department of Chemistry  Room 18-388  77 Mass. Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139.Funeral services will take place on Saturday  Nov. 21  at 11 a.m. at Chapman  Cole and Gleason  584 Route 28A  West Falmouth  Massachusetts.
Donald Stidsen  exhibitions manager at MIT Museum  dies at 63,Donald Stidsen  the longtime exhibitions manager at the MIT Museum  died last Wednesday  Oct. 28  while driving to work with his wife  Kate McHugh."Don was valued for his expertise in lighting  color  framing  and in fabricating  building  hanging  and installing exhibitions " says John Durant  director of the MIT Museum. Along with others  Stidsen was honored with an Infinite Mile Award in 2011 for his role in mounting the museum’s exhibition to mark MIT’s 150th anniversary. His many colleagues and friends depended on him  however  not just for his vast artistic knowledge  but especially for his kindness  his humor  and his style  Durant says.“In many ways ” Durant adds  “Don Stidsenwasthe MIT Museum: He was the longest-serving staff member we’ve ever had; and he saw the museum through any number of changes and developments. He represented the artisanal  ‘get-the-job-done’ tradition of museum professionalism  and his wide-ranging skills served both his colleagues and the museum’s visitors extremely well over the greater part of the museum’s history to date.”Stidsen came to the MIT Museum as one of its earliest employees  in 1982  after working at the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse  New York  and the Dickson Mounds Museum  a branch of the Illinois State Museum  in Lewistown  Illinois. He held a BFA from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth in visual design  and a master’s degree in public visual communications from Southern Illinois University  Carbondale.During his 33-year career at MIT  Stidsen either installed or supervised over 300 MIT Museum exhibitions and displays  many illuminating the work of renowned artists  engineers  and designers  as well MIT faculty and students. Whether framing works by Ansel Adams or Berenice Abbott or helping other departments at MIT — and on occasion  at Harvard University  Harvard Business School  and the Waterworks Museum in Chestnut Hill — to create or hang exhibitions  Stidsen provided an exceptional level of care  professionalism  and expertise.“He would spend hours studying photographs as he prepared to frame and hang them ” says Deborah Douglas  the museum’s director of collections. “He was simply the best lighting designer I have ever known  and likely will ever work with. With the flick of his wrist he could create a dramatic impact that I would never have thought about  much less thought possible.”“The Compton Gallery and the Kurtz Gallery for Photography were amongst his favorite museum spaces  and were showcases for his great skill at two-dimensional installations ” Gary Van Zante  the museum’s curator of architecture and design  says.Stidsen also worked closely with kinetic artist Arthur Ganson  whose sculptures have long been on display at the MIT Museum  says Mary Leen  the museum’s associate director. “Additionally  Don was one of the few people in the country with expertise in the critical aspect of lighting holograms for viewing in a museum setting ” Leen says.“Creative  smart  dedicated  patient  and cool-headed in the chaos of an exhibition installation  he was a particular master of color and light ” Douglas adds  noting that Stidsen worked with dozens of aspiring young artists and exhibitions professionals over the years.Stidsen was a collaborator  and turned concepts into beautiful spaces where the public could reflect and enjoy learning. Lora Dunn-Hardy  who recently started working for Stidsen  says that he was  “a listener  a creator  a teacher  a mentor  an artist  and a friend.”Stidsen also raised the visibility of children’s work  managing the exhibitions of the annual children’s drawing contest at MIT Medical; displaying woodworking projects by local elementary students at the museum; and archiving thousands of pictures of robots drawn by young museum visitors.Ben Wiehe  manager of the Science Festival Alliance at the museum  says he found Stidsen to be eminently approachable when the two became colleagues a few years ago.“He was just this cool person — he worked late into the night with Celtic music on  and the lights low in his office ” Wiehe says. “Sometimes  if you walked by you would see him perched on his stool  the tools of his trade scattered about: levels with particular markings  rulers and pencils  books piled high — plants  posters  coffee cups  and family photographs everywhere. For that moment you just wanted to be him  intent on his work  surrounded by all that he loved.”“Don’s death has come as a tremendous shock to us all ” Durant says. “He will be sorely missed by both his colleagues and his many friends here at MIT.”In addition to his wife  Kate McHugh  of Andover  Stidsen is survived by twin daughters  Hannah and Lizzie Stidsen. He often said that his greatest accomplishment was a life-saving organ donation to his daughter in 2006. Following his daughter’s illness  Stidsen and his family became involved as annual volunteers at Camp Sunshine  a retreat for children with life-threatening diseases and their families in Casco  Maine. Gifts in Stidsen’s memory may be made toCamp Sunshine.A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday  Nov. 14  at 11:00 a.m. at the North Parish Unitarian Universalist Church  190 Academy Road  North Andover  Massachusetts.
William Siebert  professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science  dies at 89,Professor Emeritus William M. Siebert passed away Sunday  Oct. 25  at Emerson Hospital in Concord  Massachusetts  at the age of 89. Siebert  the Ford Professor of Engineering emeritus  was widely known for his contributions to long-range radar  and for his dedication to undergraduate teaching.As the leader of the Radar Techniques Group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the early 1950s  Siebert produced the first system capable of simultaneously measuring a target’s range and velocity. This work would earn him the 1988 IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society Pioneer Award for “contributions to pulse-compression techniques for radar systems.”Born in Pittsburgh in 1925  Siebert joined the MIT faculty after completing his BS in 1946 and his ScD in 1952  both at MIT. In later years  his research used signal processing and communications system theory to understand the human ear through modeling the auditory system at the neural level. He was also interested in the pedagogical implications of using computer science for engineering teaching.Siebert’s colleagues remember him as a popular lecturer who was devoted to his teaching. His 1985 textbook  "Circuits  Signals  and Systems " based on his decades of experience teaching introductory signals and systems courses  is now considered a standard in undergraduate teaching.Siebert also worked to expand the depth and breadth of the EECS undergraduate curriculum. As computer science grew as a specialization within the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) throughout the 1970s and 1980s  it became increasingly difficult to fit the all of the necessary material into the undergraduate curriculum. Siebert envisioned a fifth-year master's program that would allow students intending to work as engineers to gain all of the necessary technical expertise  without sacrificing common core requirements. His vision informed the creation of EECS’s MEng program  and throughout the 1990s he served on the curriculum committee that designed the program.“Professor Siebert played an important role in shaping the department’s undergraduate curriculum ” said Anantha Chandrakasan  head of EECS and the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor of Electrical Engineering. “He will be greatly missed by the many students  colleagues  and friends whose lives he impacted during his decades at MIT.”Siebert was a Fellow of the IEEE  and was the Ford Professor of Engineering from 1984-1994. He retired from MIT in 2000 after teaching as a senior lecturer for several years.He is survived by four children and eight grandchildren.

David Benney  emeritus professor of mathematics  dies at 85,David J. Benney  professor emeritus of applied mathematics at MIT and former head of the Department of Mathematics  died on Oct. 9 after a period of declining health. He was 85.Benney joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1960 as assistant professor. He received a PhD in applied mathematics from MIT in 1959  studying under Chai-Chiao Lin  and continued at MIT as an instructor in 1959-60. He was promoted to full professor in 1966  and retired from MIT in 2010.Benney chaired the Applied Mathematics Committee from 1983 to 85. He served as department head for two terms between 1989-99  a period of major transition for the department and MIT. Benney set the pace for future departmental administrations through major fundraising  building innovation  and furthering the department’s cross-disciplinary culture. He expanded the visiting professorship program and hosted several first-rate visitors. He oversaw the appointment of many leading scholars to the faculty  thereby establishing the current strength of the department.David Benney’s research was highly original; as such  he made pioneering contributions to applied mathematics. He was at the leading edge of a paradigm shift in thinking about nonlinear wave systems in fluid dynamics. He not only rationalized important physical phenomena  but derived equations to describe them that became relevant in a wide variety of contexts  including aerodynamics  meteorology  oceanography  atmospheric sciences  and optics.Benney’s principal research contributions lie in the mathematical analysis of nonlinear waves  hydrodynamic stability  and transitions to turbulence. Beginning with his PhD under the direction of C.C. Lin in the 1950s  Benney and early collaborators showed that nonlinear wave interactions were fundamental to the study of hydrodynamic stability  and could lead to the emergence of turbulent bursts  as were later observed in experiments done at the National Bureau of Standards.Benney did pioneering work clarifying how nonlinearity could affect the stability of flows including shear flows over plates. This was a major advance in the field and led to many important developments in the theory of turbulence. He continued his studies of hydrodynamical stability and transition through his mentoring of numerous doctoral students and postdoctoral associates.His research on the dynamics of nonlinear waves had enormous impact in multiple fields. In his early work in 1962 describing nonlinear wave interactions in water waves  Benney developed key mathematical tools that were subsequently used extensively by the applied mathematics community. In 1964  he and his graduate student  J. Luke  derived an equation governing three dimensional weakly nonlinear shallow water waves. This equation  known as the “Benney-Luke Equation ” led to considerable research and applies in a variety of physical settings  including long wave interactions on flat beaches and long distance tsunami propagation. His further work on long waves was seminal: He showed how to find the governing equations in general circumstances. His related research on wave propagation in thin films has been used widely in many technological applications such as film-based photography and coating of materials. His research in the 1970s on large-amplitude long waves led him to formulate a novel system of equations  the so-called “Benney system ” that has since been the subject of many mathematical investigations.Benney’s research was often ahead of his time. In 1967  with his first PhD student  A. Newell  Benney showed that a particular equation (known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation) arises universally in diverse applications in nonlinear dispersive waves. Subsequent researchers found that this equation arises in the mathematical description of water waves  plasma physics and intense light waves. He soon followed with important work on three-dimensional modulated waves in water. With his student G. Roskes  he derived a system of equations  known as the "Benney-Roskes" equations  which has been widely used. Shortly thereafter  with his student M. Ablowitz  he formulated a novel class of quasi-periodic modulated wave trains. Years later  this too was found to arise in various physical systems  including fluid dynamics  optics and Bose-Einstein condensates.Benney was a dedicated teacher and mentor who left an extraordinary legacy. He had a remarkable ability to work effectively with PhD students and he mentored 18 PhDs  producing 158 academic descendants.Benney was beloved of colleagues who knew him well and worked with him closely. One of his colleagues  (and a former student) says  “Dave was a modest man who had little to be modest about. With his gentle  self-effacing manner and humor  he tended to deflect any superlatives and accolades aimed in his direction. But in truth  he was a first rate leader: generous to all  regardless of rank  he had a strong moral compass  a principled view of life and a backbone of steel when it came to doing the right thing.”A conference was held in 2000 in honor of his 70th birthday. An account of his many contributions can be found in "Research Contributions of David J. Benney " by M. Ablowitz  T. Akylas and C.C. Lin  inStudies in Applied Mathematics(Vol 108  2002  p.1-6). That issue also contains a number of articles written by his former students and colleagues in his honor.Benney served for 46 years (1968-2013) as managing editor ofStudies in Applied Mathematics.Under his long tenure  he steered the journal to prominence  making it a leading journal in physical applied mathematics.With Harvey Greenspan  he co-authored the widely-used text  "Calculus: An Introduction to Applied Mathematics " published in 1973 by McGraw Hill (later republished by Breukelin Press in 1997).David John Benney  was born in Wellington  New Zealand  on April 8  1930. He received his BS in mathematics (with first class honors) from Victoria University in Wellington  New Zealand  in 1950  followed by an MS in 1951. He studied at Cambridge University from 1952 to 1954  receiving a BA in mathematics  again with first-class honors. He returned to New Zealand as a lecturer at Canterbury University College (1955-57)  before entering the doctoral program at MIT in applied mathematics.David Benney is survived by his wife of 56 years  Elizabeth Matthews Benney; by his three children  Richard Benney of Stow  Vermont; Paul Benney of Bloomfield  Connecticut; and Antonia Benney of Longmeadow  Massachusetts; and by two grandsons  Luke and Jon.A celebration of David Benney’s life will be held for family  friends and colleagues at his home on Oct. 18.
Arnold Weinberg  former medical director at MIT Medical  dies at 85,Arnold Weinberg  medical director at MIT Medical from 1986 to 2000  died on Monday  Sept. 28 at his home in Rockport  Massachusetts. He was 85.Weinberg’s medical career spanned nearly 60 years. He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University; graduated from Harvard Medical School; and in 1956 began an internship at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After completing additional training in the Laboratory of Metabolic Enzymes at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases  he returned to MGH  joining the hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases in 1961. As an active participant in the clinical  research  and teaching activities of the Division  Weinberg designed and directed a course in microbiology and infectious diseases at Harvard Medical School and  with Robert Moellering  conducted some of the first research on mechanisms of antibiotic synergy inEnterococcusorganisms. He became chair of medicine at Cambridge Hospital in 1971  vice chair of medicine at MGH in 1975  and medical director at MIT Medical in 1986. After retiring from MIT in 2000  he returned to MGH to teach and care for patients as an infectious disease consultant until his retirement just 15 months before his death.“Arnie was a thoughtful  insightful  caring colleague  mentor  teacher  clinician  and friend ” says William Kettyle  who succeeded Weinberg as medical director at MIT Medical. Kettyle cites a number of important achievements that occurred under Weinberg’s leadership  including the start of 24-hour-per-day physician coverage at MIT Medical and a greatly enhanced relationship between MIT Medical and Partners HealthCare  resulting in increased access to superior subspecialty care for MIT patients. But Weinberg’s greatest legacy may be the establishment of a full-service  primary care facility on the campus of MIT Lincoln Laboratory  a project that involved many years of planning and discussion with laboratory and Institute leaders and coordination with a number of licensing agencies. MIT Medical/Lexington opened its doors to its first patients in 1999.As a physician who had been involved with the Lincoln Laboratory community since 1991  Associate Medical Director David Diamond remembers Weinberg asking him to help develop the operational and staffing plans for the new Lexington clinic. “He gave us free range to design the service to meet the community’s needs ” Diamond recalls. “From Arnie  we always felt trust and support  never micromanaged nor second-guessed. He took the time to praise good work  to send the occasional personal letter  hand annotated  acknowledging some special event or service.”Annette Jacobs  who served as executive director of MIT Medical under Weinberg from 1994 until 2000 remembers him as “a man with twinkling blue eyes and a marvelous deep laugh. Nothing challenged and pleased him more than working with others successfully to track down the cause of and treat an infection that was causing a patient harm  distress  discomfort.” He was an optimist about all things. That was one of his overriding qualities and strengths  adds Jacobs. “He was a partner  a colleague  a friend.”Weinberg was a world traveler  an ambitious gardener  and an avid birdwatcher. According to anobituarypublished inThe Boston Globeon Oct. 1  he continued to follow world events and sports until just a few days before his death and was particularly interested in seeing what the Cubs might do this year.“Arnie was a mentor  teacher and friend to thousands of physicians over many decades ” notes Associate Medical Director Howard Heller. “He will be sorely missed.”Weinberg is survived by his wife  Inge Toftegadd-Weinberg  and three daughters  Suzanne  Davida  and Carolyn. A celebration of his life will be held later this fall.
Frank Urbanowski  director of MIT Press for 27 years  dies at 79,The MIT Press mourns the loss of Frank Urbanowski  who served as director of the press for an unprecedented 27 years  building it into one of the largest and most successful scholarly publishers in the world. Urbanowski passed away after a long illness on Sept. 19 in Essex Junction  Vt. He was 79.Urbanowski served as director of the press from June 1975 to January 2003  and is acknowledged as a pioneer in the strategy of the focused disciplinary specialization now widely adopted by university presses. Shortly after his arrival at the MIT Press  Urbanowski devised and implemented the publishing strategy that was fundamental to its success: focusing acquisitions and marketing efforts on a small number of selected disciplines. Under his guidance  the press grew from $3 million to $22 million in annual revenue  and from publishing an annual list of 135 books and four journals to 220 books and more than 30 journals.Among the highlights of Urbanowski’s time at the MIT Press were the establishment of a desktop publishing operation in the late 1980s  the creation of the first university press website  and the publication of the first interactive electronic book — “City of Bits” by William Mitchell — in 1994. He also established the MIT Press Bookstore on Main Street in Kendall Square in 1981.In the late 1990s  Urbanowski created the Digital Projects Lab  an innovative digital-publishing group that led to today’s successful CogNet (the online community for the cognitive sciences) and ArchNet (the online resource for Islamic architecture).In addition  he ably steered the MIT Press through two significant economic downturns  managing strong recoveries each time. The press celebrated its 25th anniversary as a full-scale university press in 1986  with Urbanowski  then serving as director and editor-in-chief  citing “faith in our staff” as his core reason for confidence in its future.According to Amy Brand  current director of the MIT Press  who served as the acquisitions editor reporting to Urbanowski during the 1990s  “I and the staff of the MIT Press are deeply saddened by the news of Frank’s passing. Not only was he a remarkable leader and mentor to many of us  but he was an extremely decent and warm human being. Frank’s legacy endures as a source of inspiration for me and others at the press and in the broader academic publishing community.”Urbanowski was an engineering graduate of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and had many and diverse interests  from cabinet making to classical music. He was an opera fan  an avid rower and member of the Cambridge Boat Club  and traveled widely. At his retirement  he moved to Vermont  where he enjoyed the country life and his many advisory positions for the University of California Press  Transaction Publishers  SUNY Press  and the Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education Council. During his career  he also served on numerous boards  including: Cambridge Insight Meditation Center  Wisdom Press  University of California Press  and University Press North-East.Before coming to MIT  Urbanowski’s publishing experience included editorial and management positions at the Educational Testing Service  The Free Press of Glencoe  and the College Division of Macmillan Publishers.He is survived by his wife  Julia Blocksma; two daughters by a previous marriage  Alexandra Urbanowski and Tasha Urbanowski  as well as their husbands; two granddaughters; two stepchildren  Dewey Dunnington and Anneke Dunnington; and many cousins.Update:A memorial service will take place at the MIT Chapel on March 31  2016.
Abraham Bers  professor emeritus of electrical engineering  dies at 85,Abraham (Abe) Bers ScD ’59  professor emeritus of electrical engineering  died on Friday  Sept. 11 at the age of 85. Bers  who was recognized on campus for his trademark neatly squared bowties  was known both for his accomplishments in the field of plasma physics and for his contributions as a gifted educator.Bers was born in Czernowitz  Romania  in 1930 and immigrated to Cali  Colombia  with his family in 1948. He entered the University of California at Berkeley the following year. A principal investigator in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and the Plasma Science and Fusion Center  he joined the MIT faculty in 1959 after earning his BS at the University of California at Berkeley in 1953  his MS at MIT in 1955  and his ScD at MIT in 1959.At MIT  Bers collaborated with physicists  electrical engineers  and nuclear engineers studying nuclear fusion as a power source. Bers’ work centered around understanding and quantifying the behavior of plasma  the highly energetic state of matter necessary for fusion to take place.Together with Professor Richard Briggs  Bers made the first classifications of plasma wave instabilities in the 1960s. In later years  his research focused on radio-frequency methods for heating plasma in tokamaks  devices used to contain plasma in fusion reactors.Bers lectured frequently at European universities and institutions  spending a sabbatical in the 1970s at the University of Paris. Together with Professor Jean-Loup Delcroix of the University of Paris  he authored the two-volume "Physique des Plasmas " written in French  in which he was fluent.A longtime teacher of 6.651/8.613 (Introductory Plasma Physics I)  Bers inspired generations of students to study plasma physics  and many of them have gone on to be leaders in the field themselves. As an educator  he was known for his meticulous lecture preparation  preparing each class as though teaching it for the first time. In the final months of his life  Bers completed a textbook  "Plasma Physics and Fusion Plasma Electrodynamics " to be published by Oxford University Press this fall.“Abe was an outstanding plasma theorist and a gifted teacher ” said Miklos Porkolab  professor of physics at MIT. “He was well known for his mathematical rigor and logical explanations  not only in his papers and external lectures  but also in class at MIT.”Bers held numerous patents  was a fellow of the IEEE  a member of the American Physical Society  and a frequent consultant to industry. He was the author of several books and book chapters  including one of the early classics on the subject of plasma physics and fusion energy  "Waves in Anisotropic Plasmas."“Professor Bers had a tremendous impact on the department  and was a wonderful colleague ” said Anantha Chandrakasan  the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor of Electrical Engineering and head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “He will be greatly missed.”He is survived by his wife  Anita (Nanny) Bers  his daughter Rachel Bers  his son Josh Bers  and five grandchildren.A memorial service will be held on Wednesday  Sept. 16th at 12:30 p.m. in the MIT Chapel.
Susanne Martin  longtime MIT staff member  dies at 68,Susanne Elizabeth Martin  who worked at MIT for 29 years  passed away peacefully at her home in Reading  Massachusetts  on August 14. She was 68.She was born to Jack Martin and Rose Ellen Plutchak Martin (formerly of Rockland  Michigan) on December 3  1946. Her family moved to Detroit in 1960  where she graduated from Redford High School. She attended St. John’s College in Annapolis and completed her BA through the Harvard University Extension School.Martin’s career at MIT began at MIT Medical  where she started in 1978 as a senior office assistant. In 1993  she became the administrative officer for the Writing Program (then called the Writing and Humanistic Studies Program) in the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences  where she worked until her retirement in 2007.Like many MIT administrators of her era  Susanne played a crucial role in bringing about the office revolution in computing and communication at the Institute through implementing successive advances in communication  spreadsheets  and database management. She was an innovator who enjoyed the challenge of managing complex environments  rising to supervisor of the business office in MIT Medical from 1986 to 1993. In the early 1980s  Martin helped develop a new pharmacy cash control system and  during her years as supervisor  worked with consultants and database managers to develop a new in-house computerized billing system.As a lover of great books  an exceptionally widely read intellectual  and a discerning art appreciator  Martin savored her role as the administrative officer of the Writing Program. With her impressive range  spanning the computational complexities of administrative management and the contemporary world of the arts and humanities  she formed close friendships with many program members  who often called her the soul of the program. Martin was especially close to many of the artists in the program  including Ilona Karmel  Anita Desai  Joe and Gay Haldeman  Helen Lee  Rob Kanigel  and Ellen Cooney.Martin was also a resourceful planner and builder  managing details with ease. She oversaw the program's involvement in two major educational initiatives: a graduate program in science writing and the Institute-wide Undergraduate Communication Requirement. Extensive new interdepartmental coordinating and personnel structures were required for a growing pool of collaborating faculty  lecturers  and support staff who gave these programs their energy and effect.Martin not only oversaw the implementation of these programs  but she gained a reputation as a fixer with heart. “People over systems” was the rule of her administration. Sarah Merrow  a former graduate administrator of the Program in Science Writing  recalls  “Susanne cared deeply about the people around her  and strove to enhance the working environment in the various programs she managed. She kept a discerning eye on the well being of the staff for whom she was responsible. As a manager  she encouraged us to explore and accomplish  and knew when to step in and when to step back."As Martin rose through the administration  she became known as a talented counselor. Rob Kanigel  a former head of Writing and Humanistic Studies observed: "I’d drop by her office  sit down with her  and learn. I’d learn about the culture of MIT. I’d ask  she’d listen — her deep  still  wise eyes taking it all in  focused on the question  the problem  the conundrum. Then she’d speak. She was not shy about saying what she thought. She was forthright. But what she advised always responded to the full context of the situation  with all its ins and outs and trap doors. Her wise listening came first."Ellen Cooney  a former writer-in-residence  recalls:  "To walk into her office  whether for the first time or the hundredth  meant that you'd be met by a gracious  keenly smart  gentle-mannered professional who made you know in one second that your problem  large or small  was already on the way to being solved. There was a calm dignity about her all the time  even when she was laughing her head off at a situation that might have felt awful  had she not reached into her skill set for her gifts of humor  caring  and a lovely ability to blend her professionalism with plain old human warmth and genuine feeling. She could administrate effortlessly  even casually — or so she would make it seem."Helen Lee  professor of fiction writing  remembers: "During the days when Susanne was with the Writing Program  there was such a feeling of common purpose and warmth in the program. She never failed to ask about my family or my writing  or to share gardening tips or insights about everyday experience. She operated in the spirit of  'How can I help you to be your best?' She related to the members of the program as people  and we took genuine interest in each other's lives. She has been greatly missed since retirement and the loss is now immeasurable."After Martin retired she stayed in touch with many Writing Program colleagues  inviting small groups to teas in her historic Reading cottage  which she lovingly tended  along with her expansive perennial garden and her cat  Guy Noir. She volunteered regularly at Mission of Deeds  a Reading nonprofit that provides beds and furniture for those in need.A memorial service for Susanne will be held August 22 at the First Congregational Church in Winchester  Massachusetts. She is survived by her father  Jack Martin; her siblings  Kathleen Martin  Peggy Kreger (Brian)  John Martin (Jenny)  Fred Martin (Linda)  and Mary Martin; and her nieces Andrew  Jack  Jessica  Becky  Lizzie  and Thomas. Anyone wishing to make a memorial donation in Susanne’s memory can do so atMission of Deeds._______________________________________________________________________________Prepared by James Paradis  the Robert M.

George Adelman  noted neuroscience editor  dies at 89,George Adelman  noted neuroscience editor  died June 26 due to complications of an injury after a fall. He was 89 years old.Adelman joined MIT in 1963 as the managing editor for the Neurosciences Research Program (NRP)  developed by MIT professor of biology Francis Schmitt  bringing together the top scientists in related fields to focus on the new discipline of neuroscience.The new organization  a kind of think tank of resident and visiting scientists  had as its core 36 associates  world-class scientists representing the life sciences as well as physics  mathematics  and molecular biology. The program included six three-day "Work Sessions" per year  each bringing together leaders in an emerging field of brain studies to present current research and to consider unifying theories. These numerous sessions were edited by Adelman and published as NRP Bulletins. Other NRP meetings also aided the growth of neuroscience  especially the Intensive Study Programs of 1967  1972  1977  and 1980  which mapped the boundaries of neuroscience; each resulted in a compendium  again edited by Adelman. With more than 150 neuroscientists participated in each meeting  Adelman became influential and known internationally for his work.Adelman left MIT in 1982 when the NRP transferred to another institution. After several years of consulting  he joined Elsevier Publishing in 1985 as their neuroscience editor. There he created the well-known "Encyclopedia of Neuroscience " using his contacts to bring in articles by more than 700 authors. He published several updates  which were translated into other languages.Adelman rejoined MIT in 1993 as a visiting scientist in David Cohen’s Biomagnetism Group at the Francis Bitter Magnet Lab  where he produced his second edition of the neuroscience encyclopedia. After this group phased out in 1996  he continued in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences  where he worked on a neuroscience history and used his editing skills on such projects as a neuroanatomy textbook by Professor Gerald Schneider. Adelman was active until his last several years.
Former Magnet Lab researcher Neil Cuffin dies at 74,B. Neil Cuffin  an expert in biomagnetism — the process by which humans and other organisms produce magnetic fields — died July 21 in Florida after a struggle with cancer of the jaw and Methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) virus. He was 74 years old.Cuffin received his PhD in electrical engineering in 1975 at Penn State University  where he wrote his thesis on modeling the electric and magnetic field of the human heart under the direction of David Geselowitz. Cuffin came to MIT as a postdoc in David Cohen’s Biomagnetism Group at the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory  where he eventually become a principal investigator in his own right. He worked with this group for 21 years until it was phased out in 1996  at which time he transferred to the Epilepsy EEG Group at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston  under the direction of Donald Schomer. In 2003  Cuffin retired to Florida.The Biomagnetism Group at MIT sought to measure and understand the weak magnetic fields produced by the organs of the human body. Cuffin  the main modeler and theoretician of the group  was a pioneer in both the forward problem (calculating the external magnetic field from electrical sources in the body  such as the heart and brain)  and the magnetic inverse problem (calculating the internal sources from known external fields). Usually supported by National Institutes of Health grants  he developed and published numerous papers on inverse solutions for the magnetoencephalogram  an imaging device that measures magnetic fields in the brain  and became an international leader in this area. Although he later pursued an interest in the electroencephalogram at Beth Israel Deaconess  he is most widely remembered for his work on the biomagnetic inverse problem.

He was 95.Eppling was born in Sheboygan  Wisconsin  on March 16  1920. He was awarded BS (Phi Beta Kappa  Magna Cum Laude)  MS  and PhD degrees in physics from the University of Wisconsin. He distinguished himself academically by designing and building a mass spectrometer.During World War II  Eppling was assigned to Harvard University's secret Radio Research Laboratory and helped to devise countermeasures against enemy radar. He also served with the U.S. Navy aboard the flagship USS Estes as lead radar officer during the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After 30 years  he retired as a captain from active Naval Reserve duty.Eppling made significant contributions to particle  high-energy  and cosmic ray physics at MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. He worked there for more than 60 years  first as associate director of the laboratory  and later as a staff physicist in the Electromagnetic Interactions Group  where he was head of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Administration and Communications Group.Among the groundbreaking research projects that Eppling worked on were the L3 Detector at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics) in Geneva  Switzerland  and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment  which is deployed on the International Space Station.Eppling’s devotion to his family and profession and his desire to remain active and independent until his final days were an inspiration to all who knew him. Many will also remember him fondly as an ardent fan of the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers football teams.Eppling’s wife  Sarah “Sally” Hennessey  whom he married in 1947 in Marblehead  Massachusetts  died in 1997. He is survived by his four children  John Eppling  Ann Eppling  Patricia Prior  and Michael Eppling  and Michael’s wife Susan. He is also survived by his grandchildren Emalie Prior and Brendan Prior. At the time of his passing  Eppling was a resident of Lincoln  Massachusetts  where he lived for 59 years.
Hartley Rogers  Jr.  professor emeritus of mathematics  dies at 89,Hartley Rogers  Jr.  professor emeritus of mathematics at MIT  died at the Meadow Green Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Waltham  Massachusetts  on Friday  July 17. He was 89.Rogers joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1956 as an assistant professor  following a year’s visit at MIT. He was promoted to full professor in 1964  and retired from MIT in 2009.Rogers’ research interests were in mathematical logic  and he is credited as one of the main developers of recursion theory  and of the usefulness and validity of informal methods in this area. His 1959 paper “Computing Degrees of Unsolvability” obtained semantical completeness results for higher levels of arithmetical complexity  and underlies current methodology in studies of computable structures. Rogers authored the 1967 book “Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability ” which has become a central and standard reference in the field  and remains in print.Rogers served as vice president of the Association for Symbolic Logic  senior editor of theJournal of Symbolic Logic senior editor ofAnnals of Mathematical Logic and associate editor of theJournal of Computer and Systems Sciences.Among his distinctions  Rogers received the Lewis R. Ford Award of the Mathematical Association of America for his expository papers in 1965.Rogers’ career at MIT included significant administrative service during the 1960s and 1970s. From 1962 to 1964  he was a member of the Committee on Curriculum Content Planning  whose report radically modified the General Institute requirements for undergraduate education. In 1968  he chaired the Panel on November Events and the MIT Community  whose findings further developed the judicial processes of the Institute. Rogers served as chair of the MIT faculty from 1971 to 1973  and as associate provost from 1974 to 1980. He chaired the editorial board of the MIT Press from 1974 to 1981  as the press became an arm of the Institute’s educational mission.At Rogers’ suggestion in 1996  the Department of Mathematics initiated its Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR). Teams pair a graduate student mentor with an MIT undergraduate; each team then works intensively on a research problem over a six-week summer period  culminating with the undergraduate giving a presentation and submitting written materials to a group of math faculty. Under Rogers’ direction through 2006  SPUR became popular with students who saw its educational benefits.In 2001  the Rogers family established the Hartley Rogers  Jr. Prize for the top SPUR teams selected by the faculty. The prize has not only boosted the competitive spirit of its participants  but has attracted participation by graduate students from Harvard University and exchange students from Cambridge University.From 1993 to 2006  Rogers supervised the MIT mathematics section of the Research Summer Institute program for advanced high school students. From 1995 to 2008  he also helped develop the MIT problem-solving seminar into an important resource for students  especially freshmen  interested in participating in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition. (Each year  he invited all attendees to his home in Winchester  Massachusetts  for dinner prior to the competition.) During this period  MIT’s Putnam team placed among the top three teams 10 times  twice in first place.Rogers was a popular and respected teacher  particularly with his development of course 18.022 (Multivariable Calculus with Theory). In 1993  he received the Teaching Prize for Undergraduate Education from the School of Science. Rogers’ graduate lectures in mathematical logic were known for their beauty and clarity  and he was known for assigning challenging problem sets. He produced 19 doctoral students at MIT  with 557 mathematical “descendants” in total.“[Rogers] presented an innovative  intuitive approach to recursion theory (computability) in his lectures and classic text ” says Richard Shore  a professor of mathematics at Cornell University and former president of the Association for Symbolic Logic  who studied with Rogers as a PhD student under Gerald Sacks from 1968 to 1972. “His approach was a major influence on my development and on all other students of the subject for the past 50 years. He was both a gentleman and a scholar who was devoted to his students  university  and academic community. For me  personally  he was a model and mentor for professional conduct and service to the community for many years.”Along with mathematics  Rogers maintained a love for English literature  the field of his undergraduate degree. In the 1960s  he took up rowing with a passion. He was a founding member of the Charles River All Star Has-Beens (CRASH-B) sprints  and served as its unofficial guru for three decades. He won numerous medals at the CRASH-B sprints as well as at World Rowing Masters competitions  and in the Head of the Charles Regatta. He was the president of Boston Rowing Center  which prepared many top athletes for the U.S. national team  in the 1980s and early 1990s.Hartley Rogers  Jr.  was born in Buffalo  New York  on July 6  1926. He received his BA in English from Yale University in 1946. Following a year at Cambridge University as a Henry Fellow  he returned to Yale to complete his MS in physics in 1950. He continued his studies at Princeton University in mathematics  receiving his MA in 1951 and his PhD in 1952  with Alonzo Church was his thesis advisor. Rogers’ first academic appointment was as Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard from 1952 to 1955.Rogers was a devoted father  fiercely proud of his children and their accomplishments. He is survived by his wife  Dr. Adrianne E. Rogers; by his three children  Hartley R. Rogers  Campbell D.K. Rogers  and Caroline R. Broderick; and by 10 grandchildren.Gifts in Rogers’ memory may be made to theHartley Rogers Jr. Fundin the Department of Mathematics.
Emeritus Professor Regis Pelloux  expert on fatigue and fracture of materials  dies at 83,Régis M. N. Pelloux  professor emeritus of materials science and engineering  died July 10 after a long struggle with Parkinson's disease. He was 83 years old.Pelloux was born in Passy  France  in the Alps  and had a life-long love of the outdoors  which he shared with his family  friends  colleagues  and students. He was educated in France and then received a Jean Gaillard Fellowship to study at MIT  where he received an MS in 1956 and a PhD in 1958. After completing his doctorate  he enrolled in the French army  stationed at the French Army Atomic Research Centre. In 1961  he was hired by Boeing Scientific Research Laboratories to work on difficult assignments relating to turbine fracture. He joined the MIT faculty in 1968  in what is now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.At MIT  Pelloux was a researcher and educator in what was the new and relatively small field of fatigue and fracture of engineering materials and structures. He worked closely with faculty in the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Mechanical Engineering; consulted widely; and taught an unusually large course load. He was generous with his time and expertise  offering advice and a listening ear to junior faculty and graduate students and frequently collaborating with colleagues throughout the Institute  even offering his skills to the MIT Physical Plant Department when a large centrifugal refrigeration compressor failed in one of the main buildings. His students remember his big heart  his love of his adopted country  and his support for them and MIT. He retired in 1995.Pelloux was a fellow of ASM International and the American Institute of Mining  Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers  a recipient of the Albert Sauveur Award from ASM International  and an honorary member of the French Society of Metallurgy and Materials.He is survived by his wife  Isabel; his son  Marc  and daughter-in-law Carolynn; and his daughter Babette and daughter-in-law Ronda.All are invited to memorial service on October 8 at 2 p.m. in the MIT Chapel. A reception will follow.In lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to MIT  in memory of Regis Pelloux for the DMSE Graduate Fellowship Fund (account3122200).
Hamlin Jennings  Concrete Sustainability Hub principal investigator  dies at 68,Hamlin M. Jennings  adjunct professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and principal investigator in the Concrete Sustainability Hub  died on July 8 at his home in Cambridge  Massachusetts  after a battle with cancer. He was 68.A prominent scientist and engineer  Jennings was widely recognized as a preeminent researcher and leader in the field of cement chemistry. He developed fundamentals of cement sciences that were transformational in concrete engineering applications  including the first fully quantitative model of the nanostructure of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H)  the major component of hydrated cement.Jennings joined the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub in 2010 as the inaugural executive director  leading a multi-disciplinary team of physicists  materials scientists  engineers and architects  and pushing them to new frontiers of science-based engineering.When Jennings started his career in cement science in the late 1970s  the field was classically divided in two branches: cement chemistry and mechanics. Only a small number of researchers were exploring the intersection of chemistry  materials science  and mechanics. Trained as a physicist and materials scientist  Jennings recognized that a true materials science approach for cementitious materials remained to be developed. For the next 35 years  he led advances in the field  ultimately defining what is now known as the materials science of cement-based materials.Jennings was born on August 4  1946  in Massachusetts. His father was a professional accountant. His mother was a professor of chemistry at Wheaton College. He graduated with a BS in physics from Tufts University in 1969  and a PhD in materials science from Brown University in 1975. Following a research fellow position at the University of Cape Town in South Africa  he began studying cementitious materials at Imperial College in London  where he was strongly influenced by Hal F.W. Taylor  considered the father of modern cement chemistry.Jennings joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the U.S. Department of Commerce as a physical scientist from 1982 to 1987  where he built a group in computational materials science of concrete aimed  for the first time  at blending physical chemistry of cement with prediction of mechanical behavior. During this time  he developed the first computer model of cement hydration. This groundbreaking work was quickly recognized by his contemporaries and it launched a whole new field of computational cement science  leading ultimately to the development of NIST’s Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory.Jennings joined Northwestern University as an associate professor in 1987  becoming a full professor in 1994 and serving as chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from 2002 to 2006. Jennings’ growing scientific reputation was instrumental in the establishment at Northwestern of the Advanced Cement-Based Materials Research Center  a National Science Foundation-sponsored multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research center aimed at expanding and improving the application of cement and concrete to meet society’s pressing future needs for housing  shelter  hospitals  and infrastructure.Jennings broke new ground in cement science in the mid-1980s with his proposition that the performance of concrete materials can be captured in terms of quasi-equilibrium phase diagrams of the hydration products. A decade later  this fundamental contribution enabled the development of ultra-high-performance concrete  which attains properties like mild steel  and which revolutionized the concrete world. In research  these phase diagrams became the foundation for the implementation of molecular science approaches of cement hydrates  the binding phase of concrete.In 2000  Jennings published his most widely cited and influential paper  entitled simply “A model for the microstructure of calcium-silicate-hydrate in cement paste.” This was known for years as the “colloid model” of C-S-H  and more recently and appropriately  as the “Jennings model” of C-S-H. Hamlin continued to refine and extend the model and its associated insights into the nanostructure and behavior of C-S-H  particularly with regard to the role of water in the smallest pores and spaces. He published a major update to his model in 2008 called “CM-II” that described the internal structure of the fundamental C-S-H particles. He led a large group of researchers to publish  just one week before his death  an important paper on the hysteresis behavior of water in C-S-H during drying and rewetting.The Jennings Colloid Model closed the loop between molecular understanding and manufacturing of cement-based materials so that it is now possible to design cement-based materials with specific strength  fracture and durability properties. These quantitative breakthroughs on the science front resulted in many industrial concrete materials innovations  including seeded cement-based materials  innovative cement-based materials for oil- and gas well applications  and silicate-based protective coatings for metals.Jennings’ most recent research efforts at MIT were aimed at developing sustainable cement-based materials to meet India’s need for housing and infrastructure. In this research  he returned to the very foundation of his unique thermodynamic framework for cementitious materials  at the intersection of materials science and mechanics as a basis for predicting and fine-tuning long-term durability properties.Jennings  an entrepreneurial inventor who carried his research findings all the way from the lab to full commercial production  was also a highly sought consultant for the concrete and cement industry  the glass and fiberglass industry  and real-estate development. With his unique blend of science-inspired engineering  he proposed a new vision for cement-based materials in the 21st century — one that capitalizes on the availability of the raw materials and recognizes the social impact of the concrete on our living conditions while minimizing the environmental footprint.Throughout his distinguished career  Jennings was dedicated educator  an inspiring instructor  and a generous and encouraging mentor. He left a lasting impact on his many students and colleagues; in the classroom  on the drawing tables and whiteboards in his offices at Northwestern University and MIT  and through the more than 200 scholarly papers he authored and co-authored.Hamlin Jennings is survived by his wife  Glenys Jennings; his mother  Bojan Jennings; and his daughter  Ashley Jennings.
Louis Howard  professor emeritus of mathematics  dies at 86,Louis Norberg Howard  emeritus professor of mathematics at MIT  and McKenzie emeritus professor at Florida State University  died on Sunday  June 28  at the age of 86.Howard joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1955 as an assistant professor  and was promoted to full professor in 1964. He retired from MIT in 1984.Howard was an applied mathematician who worked primarily in the field of fluid dynamics. He made fundamental contributions to a broad range of subjects  including hydrodynamic stability and geophysical flows. He made a number of key advances in our understanding of turbulent convection  flows in Hele-Shaw cells  salt-finger zones  rotating flows  and reaction-diffusion equations. The power of his mathematical modeling was evident when he transformed qualitative ideas about the bounds on turbulent transport into rigorous mathematical arguments that initiated the field of upper-bound theory.While his background was in physics and applied mathematics  he had an exceptional command of pure mathematics  as evidenced by his existence proofs concerning the hydrodynamic equations  and his elegant Semicircle Theorem. His mathematical powers were highlighted when he generalized and simplified extensive previous work on the Richardson number criterion for shear flows. He also had a practical side  and was no stranger to either the laboratory or oceanographic field work. His rare combination of physical intuition and analytic power gave his work its characteristic physical relevance  breadth  and depth.Howard was a scholar and a gentleman  beloved  admired and respected by all who knew him. He was a generous collaborator and mentor who shared his deep knowledge of fluid dynamics and applied mathematics with modesty and grace. He published widely with colleagues  postdocs  and students. He supervised nine PhDs at MIT  one at Princeton University  two at Florida State University  and he co-mentored several graduate students from other institutions. He continued his research long after retirement; his final paper is soon to appear in theJournal of Fluid Mechanics.Howard was an inspiring teacher who taught a wide range of undergraduate and graduate subjects at MIT. He was fundamental to the successful expansion of MIT’s graduate program in applied mathematics. His time at MIT coincided with the expansion of the physical applied math group  of which he was a central figure. After MIT  Howard joined the faculty at Florida State University (FSU) in 1981 as professor of mathematics and affiliate professor of mechanical engineering. His departure for FSU was a great loss to the MIT scientific community. In 1986  he was appointed to the FSU Foundation Professorship  and he retired from FSU in 1996. His recent passing has been a blow to the international fluid mechanics community  which recognized him as one of its leading lights.Howard had developed a long-term association with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was one of the original members of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Summer Program in 1959  on whose steering committee he served from the early 1960s until 1984. Howard was the principal lecturer at GFD on several occasions  giving a series of advanced courses that helped establish the foundations of geophysical fluid dynamics. He supervised many GFD Fellows  and remained an active member of the WHOI GFD Summer School long after his retirement. Howard also built and maintained a cottage on Crooked Pond in Falmouth  Massachusetts  where he was a generous host to many.Howard served as the representative of the American Mathematical Society on the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from 1979 to 1982  and on its Science Policy Committee from 1983 to 1987. In 1983 he was a member of the Council of the Fluid Dynamics Division of the American Physical Society. He served on the advisory board of Dynamical Systems Group of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics from 1989 to 1991.Howard was born in Chicago  Illinois  on March 12  1929. He received his BA in physics from Swarthmore College in 1950  and his MA and PhD in mathematical physics from Princeton  in 1952 and 1953  respectively  under the supervision of Donald Spencer. He took an appointment as a Higgins lecturer in mathematics at Princeton in 1953  after which he became a research associate in mathematics and aeronautics at Caltech in 1955.Howard was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965 and the American Physical Society in 1984  and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1977. In 1997  he was honored with the prestigious Fluid Dynamics Prize of the American Physical Society.Howard was married for almost 50 years to Alice G. S. Howard  with whom he had five children. They were divorced in 2000. Howard is survived by his ex-wife and four of his children  Astrid H. Howard  Emily A. Howard  Maxwell Carr-Howard and Holly H. Bjorklund.
Frederic Morgenthaler  professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science  dies at 82,Frederic Richard “Rick” Morgenthaler ’55 (VI-A)  SM ’56  PhD ’60  professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT  died on June 21 at the age of 82. Morgenthaler was an accomplished researcher and educator  who spent his long career at MIT studying the theory and applications of electromagnetism.Born on March 12  1933  in Cleveland  Ohio  Morgenthaler trained as an electrical engineer at MIT  completing a BS  and then an MS in 1956. He began his research in the field of nonreciprocal microwave ferrite devices while serving in the United States Air Force from 1957-1959. He went on to continue his research in the area under the direction of Professor Lan Jen Chu in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)  receiving his PhD in 1960. He joined the MIT faculty the same year.Morgenthaler led the Microwave and Quantum Magnetics Group in MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE)  where his research focused on the theory underpinning the propagation of electromagnetic waves  and its numerous practical applications.In the introduction to the 2011 textbook he authored on the subject  "The Power and Beauty of Electromagnetic Fields "Morgenthaler wrote eloquently on the topic that was the focus of his research for nearly four decades at MIT.He described the bronze plaque in MIT’s Eastman Laboratories (Building 6)  inscribed with the mathematical symbols that represent Maxwell’s Equations. These simple equations  which predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves propagating at the speed of light  he explained  have made possible much of the technology we depend on today  from radio  to X-rays  to magnetic resonance imaging  to the Internet. “No one can doubt the utility — the power — of electromagnetic theory ” Morgenthaler wrote.A dedicated educator  Morgenthaler worked to equip MIT electrical engineering students with a deeper understanding of electromagnetism. He taught undergraduate electrical engineering core curriculum subjects in electromagnetic field theory  circuit theory  and semiconductor electronics. He also served as graduate officer for EECS from 1993 to 1996.Morgenthaler was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the author of over 100 scientific publications. He held the Cecil H. Green Professorship for 1984-1986. After his retirement in 1996  he continued to teach as a senior lecturer until 2000.“Professor Morgenthaler greatly enriched MIT through his research  and his dedication to educating several generations of MIT electrical engineers ” says Anantha Chandrakasan  head of EECS and the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor in Electrical Engineering. “His colleagues at MIT and the numerous students that he mentored throughout his career will miss him greatly.”Morgenthaler  who lived in Wellesley  Massachusetts  is survived by his wife of 57 years  Barbara Pullen Morgenthaler; two daughters  Ann Rappaport SM ’88 of Wellesley and Janet Krolman; two sons-in-law  Carey Rappaport PhD ’87 and Arthur Krolman; and four grandchildren  Sarah and Brian Rappaport and Douglas and Tess Krolman.
Mujid Kazimi  leading educator and researcher in nuclear technology  dies at 67,Mujid S. Kazimi  the TEPCO Professor of Nuclear Engineering and one of the world’s foremost educators and researchers in nuclear technology  died suddenly on Wednesday in China.Kazimi  who was 67  suffered a heart attack while visiting Harbin Engineering University to participate in an international advisory committee. He held faculty appointments in MIT’s Departments of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) and Department of Mechanical Engineering  and was director of both MIT’s Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems and the Kuwait-MIT Center for Natural Resources and the Environment. He served as NSE’s department head from 1989 to 1997.Current NSE department head Richard Lester shared the news of Kazimi’s death in an email to the department’s faculty on Wednesday  describing it as “a devastating blow.”“The international community knew Mujid as one of the world’s great nuclear engineers ” Lester toldMIT News. “In NSE  we also knew him as a wonderful human being. Wise  kind  tough when he needed to be  but always gracious and respectful toward his students and his colleagues — he was a true gentleman  and he was a good man. His dedication and loyalty to his students  and to the department  were inspirational. It is a huge loss for our department  and for our field. But his colleagues in NSE are grateful for the privilege of knowing and serving with him.”Kazimi was born in Jerusalem in 1947  and later moved with his family to Amman  Jordan. He earned his bachelor’s degree in nuclear engineering from Alexandria University in Egypt in 1969  then came to MIT  where he earned an SM in 1971 and a PhD in 1973. Before joining the MIT faculty in 1976  Kazimi worked briefly at Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Brookhaven National Laboratory.Kazimi was an expert in the design and analysis of nuclear power plants and the nuclear fuel cycle. He supervised 45 PhD theses and 80 master’s theses at MIT; Lester notes that many of his students have gone on to faculty positions at universities worldwide  or to leadership positions in the nuclear energy field.Kazimi was dedicated to the advancement of the profession  and advised governments  universities  and research institutions on the development of nuclear energy. He authored over 200 scientific papers  and co-authored  with Neil Todreas  a two-volume textbook  “Nuclear Systems.”Lester says that Kazimi’s contributions to the field included “numerous technological advances that promise to enhance the safety and economics of nuclear power plants.” Among his most important contributions are the development of annular fuel with internal and external cooling  offering the potential for dramatic reductions in the fuel operating temperature  thereby reducing the thermal energy stored in the fuel.Kazimi also led efforts to develop a ceramic fuel cladding made of silicon carbide to replace the zirconium alloy cladding that is currently used in most reactor fuel. This new cladding  Lester says  “has the potential to reduce significantly the consequences of loss-of-coolant accidents in light water reactors ” because it greatly reduces the generation of potentially explosive hydrogen in such accidents.Kazimi also made “a number of influential contributions to the development of technological strategies for the nuclear fuel cycle ” Lester says. “His research generated fundamental insights into the range of options for fuel-recycling technologies  enabling the sustainable development of nuclear energy along economically competitive paths that will take advantage of the abundance of natural uranium.” Kazimi co-chaired  with Ernest Moniz — the former MIT physicist who is now the U.S. Secretary of Energy — an influential  and widely read  interdisciplinary study on the future of the nuclear fuel cycle.Kazimi received many honors for his work. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and the International Nuclear Energy Academy  and recipient of the Kuwait Prize in Applied Sciences in 2011.Kazimi served on many boards  including the board of trustees of Al-Quds University in Jerusalem  a committee on the rejuvenation of scientific research in Kuwait  and the international advisory board on nuclear energy for the United Arab Emirates. He was a member of the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee of the U.S. Department of Energy  and at the time of his death was chairing its subcommittee on nuclear reactor technology.Lester described Kazimi as “one of the world’s most distinguished educators and researchers in the field of nuclear technology. His outstanding scientific and engineering achievements are recognized around the world.”Kazimi is survived by his wife of 41 years  Nazik Denny  by three children — daughter Yasmeen and sons Marwan (a 1996 MIT alumnus) and Omar — and by three grandchildren.A memorial service for Kazimi will be held Oct. 1 in MIT's Bartos Theater  E15-070  beginning at 4:00 p.m. A reception will follow. Donations in his memory can be made toThe Mujid S. Kazimi Memorial Fundto support future NSE graduate students.For any questions about the memorial service  contact Carolyn Carrington at carrin@mit.edu or 617-253-7407.
Charles Correa  influential architect and planner  dies at 84,Alumnus and former professorCharles CorreaMArch ’55 — described as “India’s greatest architect” — passed away on Tuesday at age 84. A visionary architect and urban planner  Correa built a substantial legacy through a wide range of projects in his native India and around the world  including MIT’s Brain and Cognitive Science Complex.Over a six-decade career  Correa became a leading voice in the world of international architecture and an influential figure in post-war India. His buildings  known for an open style that embraced climate and made dramatic use of natural light and connection to the sky  “stand out in bland landscapes like an exclamation point ”The Times of Indiawrote.Correa’s projects spanned museums  public buildings  commercial spaces  hotels  and residences. But he also wove urban development and low-income housing into a life defined by a strong sense of social purpose. "Just as there is writing and then there is literature  there is construction and then there is architecture. Great architecture can change society " Correa said.“A strong voice for modern optimism  Charles brought the architectural output of the Indian subcontinent to the world’s attention. In turn  through his passionate advocacy for high-quality design from the scale of individual buildings to planning for entire cities  he influenced the global discourse well beyond the practice of architecture alone ” said Hashim Sarkis  dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “He was a remarkable thinker  designer  artist  and activist. We could not be more proud that he learned  taught  and built at MIT.”A built legacy around the world and at MITBorn in Secunderabad  India  in 1930  Correa attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate. After graduation in 1953  he earned a Master’s degree in architecture from MIT in 1955 and returned to India to start his own practice.Notable building projects include theGandhi Memorial Museumin Ahmedabad  India  completed when he was just 28 years old; theState Assembly buildingfor Madhya Pradesh in India; theKanchanjunga Apartmentsin Mumbai  India; and theChampalimaud Centre for the Unknownin Lisbon  Portugal.At MIT  Correa was one of three alumni — along with Julian Beinart MArch ’56  who also taught at the Institute  and Roger Goldstein SB ’74 MArch ’76 — who designed theBrain and Cognitive Science Complex(Building 46)  home to the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences  the Picower Institute  and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. For the project  the designers had to devise an elegant solution to bring the three distinct research organizations together under one roof  on an oddly shaped site divided in the middle by an active railway.Correa also had a long relationship with theAga Khan Foundation  stretching from his membership in 1977 on the steering committee that developed theAga Khan Award for Architectureto one of Correa’s last building projects completed when he was 84 — the newIsmaili Centre  adjacent to the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto  Canada."A model of what an architect can and should be"Correa also devoted considerable attention during his career to issues of urban development and low-income housing. In the late 1960s  at the invitation of the government of Peru and the United Nations  Correa helped with the design of a groundbreaking  experimental low-income housing community calledPREVI  for Proyecto Experimental de Vivienda ("experimental housing project").During the same period  he embarked on the preparation for a master plan for Navi Mumbai  India  one of the largest planned cities in the world  and served from 1971 to 1975 as the chief architect for the municipality’s development. He also later served as the chairman for the National Commission on Urbanisation for the Government of India. Correa captured his ideas on urban development in the Third World in "The New Landscape " a seminal book published in 1985.This sustained attention to architecture  planning  and societal impact makes Correa an exemplary architect  said William Porter  who served as dean of the School of Architecture and Planning from 1971 to 1981. “Through long association and friendship I came to know how remarkable Charles Correa was  not only through his gorgeous and culturally meaningful buildings  but also through his deep commitments to equity and social justice and his inspiration of clients  colleagues  and students ” Porter said. “We have lost a truly wonderful and accomplished person  but we have gained a legacy of significant works and a model of what an architect should and can be.”During his life  Correa was recognized with numerous awards  including the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects  which named him “India’s Greatest Architect” in 2013; the Chicago Architecture Award from the American Institute of Architects; the UIA Gold Medal from the Union of International Architects; and the Aga Khan Award for Architecture.Student  teacher  colleague  and friendCorrea maintained a lifelong connection with the Institute. After receiving his degree  he returned to MIT as a professor in 1962  and then intermittently but continuously taught and lectured at MIT for nearly 50 years.“I had the privilege of counting him as a colleague and friend when he taught at MIT. The enormity of his intellectual range and curiosity set him apart and enabled him to engage deeply across all of MIT's learning cultures ” said Philip Khoury  associate provost for the arts and the Ford International Professor of History.As a teacher  Correa cautioned against snuffing out students’ creativity in the process of educating them and emphasized the need for students to draw upon experienced faculty while developing independent judgment. “We do not know if architecture can be taught — but we know it can be learnt ” Correa wrote. “For learning is a process that depends on us ourselves  and our attitude of mind.”
Professor Emeritus James Fay dies at 91,James A. (Jay) Fay  a professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering  past away on Tuesday  June 2  of complications from lymphoma. He was 91.The list of people who will miss him is large: His devoted family of six children and their spouses  18 grandchildren  and four great-grandchildren  are the first to feel the loss. But close behind are the many professionals at MIT and a host of other institutions and causes that benefitted from his extraordinary personal talents.Fay grew up in Brooklyn  New York  but spent his summers in Southold  New York  close to the waters of the Long Island Sound. This motivated his lifelong interest in sailing and led him to earn a BS at the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture in 1944  while an ensign with the U.S. Naval Reserve. Subsequently  he obtained an MS from MIT in marine engineering and a PhD from Cornell University in the unsteady propagation of gaseous detonation waves. After serving on the Cornell faculty from 1951 to 1955  he was recruited to join MIT as an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE)  where he remained until transitioning to emeritus professor status in 1989.The hallmark of Fay’s success as an innovator and contributor was listening carefully and crystallizing the essence of a discussion. Having reached that point  he was committed to seeing a process through to the appropriate conclusion. This was true across the board  whether it was a decision to perform a “ready – about” in a sailing race or writing a definitive opinion on the ecological folly of extending the John F. Kennedy Airport runways into Jamaica Bay. His selection of research topics at MIT was geared to the common good: air and water pollution problems  acid rain  the safety hazards of liquefied gases  renewable energy  and the spread of oil and other hazardous liquids on the ocean. However  it was his early career work on combustion and detonation  hypersonic heat transfer  magnetohydrodynamics  and plasmadynamics that were the hallmarks of his election into the National Academy of Engineering in 1998. He continued to create new textbooks after his decision to become emeritus.Fay’s great ability to synthesize solutions in difficult circumstances was amply demonstrated in his service to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as chairman from 1972 to 1977 of the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport)  the organization that controls Logan Airport  the Boston seaport  and several other Boston-area transportation facilities. Under Fay’s leadership  Massport transitioned into a sleeker  more environmentally-aware public-serving entity. In the words of Alan Altschuler  former secretary of transportation for the Commonwealth  “Jay’s combination of wisdom  deep knowledge  total integrity  and courage in the face of (unfair public) attacks through even the most stressful controversies was absolutely remarkable.”Fay played key roles in no fewer than 20 environmental organizations and panels that sought to develop public policy in a new world threatened with pollution and environmental hazards. This included 46 years of service as a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists seeking to ameliorate the threat of nuclear catastrophe. His reasoned and thoughtful scientific approach to these problems was critically important in building credibility for public examination of our approach to environmental threats.The family has arranged a funeral mass at St. Julia Church at 374 Boston Post Road in Weston  Massachusetts  on Saturday  June 13  at 10 a.m. This will be followed by a celebration of his life at the Biagio Ristorante at 123 Moody Street in Waltham.
Judith Layzer  expert on environmental politics  dies at 53,Judith Layzer  a professor at MIT and an accomplished scholar who produced influential work on environmental policy and politics  died Thursday after an extended illness. She was 53.Layzer had been on the faculty of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) since 2003  and had served as associate head of the department since 2014.Layzer’s research explored the politics of environmental policies  and the role of science in shaping public debate on these matters. Scientific evidence  as she detailed in many of her writings  provides a powerful foundation for environmental advocacy — but policies do not always simply follow from that science  she noted  since disputes over the environment are often contested between groups with differing or opposing values. In this context  Layzer concluded  the quality of environmental advocacy matters greatly.For instance  those combating climate change — a position Layzer supported publicly — needed a “politically compelling story” to gain more support  as she wrote in aBoston Reviewarticle in 2012.“You have to fight ideas with ideas ” Layzer added in a 2013 interview withMIT News.Within the field of environmental policy and politics  Layzer’s work ranged widely across topics  including clean air and clean water regulations  land protection  species conservation  and climate change. She had also become increasingly focused on issues of urban sustainability  including studies of food systems.Layzer wrote three books and published numerous articles  among other scholarly accomplishments  while teaching highly regarded classes to MIT undergraduates and graduate students.Layzer’s colleagues remember her as a person driven by a strong sense of ethics and possessing exceptional intellectual qualities.“Besides being a brilliant scholar and exceptional writer  Judy was also a dedicated — and demanding — teacher ” says Professor Eran Ben-Joseph  head of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “She was an inspiration and a role model precisely because she expected the best from her students  her colleagues  and herself. She was tough  but always fair; stern  but always caring.”Ben-Joseph adds: “Judy was motivated by intellectual curiosity and a zest for academic inquiry  but more importantly she was driven by an underlying sense of ethics and a core belief that we would be wrong — period  no qualifiers — to destroy the planet and its natural systems. She was a true friend who would often make you laugh and a scientist who would always make you think. She was a person of genuine integrity who will be sorely missed.”Influential work  popular teachingLayzer received her undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Michigan in 1983  and her PhD in 1999 from MIT’s Department of Political Science. Her doctoral thesis  “Sense and Credibility ” examined a series of environmental-protection disputes  ranging from the controversy over acid rain to restoration of the Florida Everglades.In her work  Layzer detailed how science is a foundation for environmental advocacy  while noting that policy decisions are often settled by the relative strengths of the opposing coalitions. However  science-based advocacy  she asserted  can influence the strength of those opposing groups.Her thesis research became part of her first book  “The Environmental Case: Translating Values into Policy” (CQ Press  2002)  an influential work now in its third edition; Layzer added considerable new material  on climate change and other topics  to the later editions.Layzer’s second book  “Natural Experiments” (MIT Press  2008)  examined whether recent approaches to conservation across the U.S. have been effective; she concluded that some of these programs are less likely to produce environmental improvements than policies enacted through traditional top-down political means.In her 2012 book  “Open for Business” (MIT Press)  Layzer examined how conservatives sometimes have succeeded in environmental debates by tapping into  among other things  public mistrust of regulation to argue for opening up federal lands for further development.Layzer taught at Middlebury College from 1998 until 2003  when she rejoined MIT as an assistant professor in DUSP. She was promoted to associate professor in 2007  and to full professor in 2014; she also became head of MIT’s Environmental Policy and Planning Group in 2010.Layzer gave talks at academic and policy conferences both around the U.S. and internationally. Awards she received included the Lynton B. Caldwell Prize for best book in environmental politics and policy; the John C. Donovan Prize for Best Paper  awarded by the New England Political Science Association; the 2013 DUSP Graduate Student Council Advising Award; and the 2008 MIT Graduate Student Council Teaching Award.Layzer supervised or read dozens of master’s and PhD theses in DUSP  and taught a wide range of courses  including the popular course 11.002J (Making Public Policy)  as well as others on science and politics  energy politics  ecosystem management  and food systems.Outside the classroom  Layzer was known to friends (and competitors) as a world-class ultimate frisbee player. The Boston-based club team she played for  known as “Lady Godiva ” won the U.S. national championship seven times between 1995 and 2002  and won the world championship in 1998.Layzer is survived by her parents  David and Jean Layzer  and by her four siblings: Carolyn  Emily  Nicholas  and Jonathan. Donations in her memory can be made toGrub Streetto support an innovative  rigorous  and welcoming community for writers.
Jane Farver  former director of the MIT List Visual Arts Center  dies,Jane Farver  a renowned art curator and administrator and the former director of the MIT List Visual Arts Center  passed away suddenly on April 29. Farver was in Venice  Italy  acting as the editor for the catalog being produced to support the List’s presentation of new work by artist Joan Jonas for the U.S. Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale  opening later this week.Throughout the course of her distinguished 12-year tenure as director of the List (1999-2011)  Farver contributed greatly to the vibrant life of the arts community on the MIT campus  in Boston and internationally. Her directorship was distinguished by the List’s presentation of internationally acclaimed contemporary art exhibitions and a remarkable increase in the commissioning of major public artworks throughout the campus.“On behalf of the entire List community  I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Jane Farver ” said Paul Ha  director of the List Visual Arts Center. “Her impact in the contemporary art world is formidable and  and we will forever be thankful for her contribution. We mourn the sudden loss of our dear friend and colleague and are incredibly grateful for all that Jane gave to our community during her long and distinguished career.”During her time at the List  Farver collaborated with a diverse range of artists and organized groundbreaking exhibitions  including solo exhibitions and projects by Mel Chin  Michael Joo  Paul Pfeiffer  Runa Islam  Kimsooja  John Coplans  Adel Abdessemed  and Tavares Strachan. She also organized a number of group exhibitions  often with colleagues at MIT and other leading cultural institutions  including the landmark exhibition  "Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin  1950s-1980s " and "Sensorium: Parts I & 2 – Embodied Experience  Technology  and Contemporary Art." She assembled a dedicated staff of museum professionals at the List and also brought in distinguished outside curators and exhibitions  such as "Cameron Jamie " organized by Philippe Vergne of the Walker Art Center  and "Y E S Yoko Ono " organized by Alexandra Munroe with Fluxus scholar Jon Hendricks.Philip S. Khoury  MIT associate provost and the Ford International Professor of History  said  “On behalf of MIT  we share our condolences with Jane’s family and friends. As Jane’s longtime colleagues and friends  we mourn the loss of a stalwart advocate for the arts and will forever be grateful for all that she contributed to the MIT community.”Under her leadership  the List organized presentations for two international art biennials  including artist Paul Pfeiffer’s project as the U.S. representative for the 9th Cairo Biennial in 2003  an exhibition that traveled to Athens for the 2004 Olympic Games  and artist Fred Wilson’s exhibition at the U.S. Pavilion of the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003  on which Kathleen Goncharov was the commissioner. Farver also served as one of six curators to organize the Whitney Museum of American Art’s 2000 Biennial.In addition to organizing major exhibitions at the List and around the world  Farver oversaw MIT’s celebrated Percent-for-Art program  which under her stewardship added more than 10 major works to the campus  such as Cai Guo-Qiang’s "Ring Stone" (2010) outside of the Sloan School building; Anish Kapoor’s "Non-Object (Plane)" (2010)  a mirrored  stainless-steel work inside the Frank Gehry-designated Stata Center; Sol LeWitt’s "Bars of Colors within Squares (MIT)" (2007)  a vibrantly colored floor for the 5 500 square foot U-shaped atrium of the Green Center for Physics (Building 6C); and Sarah Sze’s "Blue Poles" (2006) running up the façade of the Sidney Pacific Graduate Dormitory. Farver also revitalized the List’s artist residency program  offering artists the opportunity to work with MIT’s remarkable students  faculty  and staff. Through the residency program  several artists each year  including Cai Guo-Qiang  Tavares Strachan  Adel Abdessemed  and Matthew Day Jackson  came to campus to seek new insights and push the boundaries of their practices.Following her retirement from the List in 2011  Farver returned to New York and worked as an independent curator  recently serving as a consulting director for U.S. Biennial  Inc.  the organization that funds the Prospect triennial in New Orleans. She was also a visiting critic at Cornell University’s AAP NYC program and was consulting on the creation of a new art program at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Farver was enlisted to edit the catalogue for artist Joan Jonas’s upcoming exhibition for the U.S. Pavilion  titled "They Come to Us without A Word" by Paul Ha.Before coming to the List  Farver served as the director of exhibitions at the Queens Museum of Art in New York (1992-1999); director of Lehman College Art Gallery at the City University of New York (1989-1992); director of the Tomoko Liguori Gallery (1987-89); and director/curator at the Alternative Museum (1985-87).

Moore  her brother Richard Farver of Corry  Pennsylvania; her sister Mary Terry of Seattle  Washington; as well as extended family including stepchildren  nieces  nephews  and grandchildren.Plans for a memorial service are forthcoming.
Alexander Rich dies at 90,Alexander Rich  an MIT biophysicist best known for his work on the structural biology of RNA and DNA  died Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 90.Rich  the William Thompson Sedgwick Professor in MIT’s Department of Biology  continued coming in to his office until two months ago  when he was admitted to the hospital.A pre-eminent researcher in structural molecular biology — a field that seeks to understand the molecular architecture of living organisms — Rich made major contributions to understanding the relationships between the structures and functions of RNA and DNA molecules.James Watson and Francis Crick first described the right-handed  double helical structure of DNA in 1953. In 1979  Rich led a team of MIT researchers who startled the world of structural biology with the announcement that they had found a “left-handed” form of DNA. The new form  coiled in the shape of a left-handed screw  was called Z-DNA because of its zigzag backbone  but its significance remained a mystery for many years.“After the initial discovery  many labs set out to understand the biology of Z-DNA  which turned out to be a much more difficult endeavor than discovering the structure in the first place ” says Thomas Schwartz  an associate professor of biology at MIT who was a PhD student of Rich’s and helped decipher the function of Z-DNA. “While we still do not fully understand its biological role  the work on Z-DNA emphasized perhaps more than any other single piece of data how important the three-dimensional conformation of DNA in the context of the cell is.”In 1995  researchers led by Rich reported the first biological role for left-handed Z-DNA and detailed the identification of a protein that binds tightly to Z-DNA. The protein has long been recognized as an “editor” that can change the genetic message of RNA. Its affinity for Z-DNA may help it find genes that are producing the messenger RNA that it edits.Deciphering biological structuresRich’s pioneering work started in 1955 when  together with a colleague  he deduced the three-dimensional  triple helical structure of collagen  the major fibrous protein of skin and connective tissue.One year later  as a section chief in physical chemistry at the National Institutes of Health  he and a colleague discovered that two single-stranded nucleic acid molecules could spontaneously and specifically combine to form a double helix. This was the first hybridization reaction  a reaction that in various forms became a major technique in the development of molecular biology. In 1957  his group discovered that nucleic acids could form triple helices  a finding widely used in biotechnology today.At MIT in 1960  Rich discovered that an RNA strand and a DNA strand could form a double helix  which helped explain how cells copy DNA into messenger RNA.He led student researchers in 1962 to the discovery of polysomes  the clusters of protein synthesis machinery held together by a messenger RNA molecule. These are the functional units used by cells to translate genetic information into proteins.Born in Hartford  Conn.  in 1924  Rich served with the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1946. He received a bachelor’s in biochemical sciences from Harvard University in 1947  and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1949.From 1949 to 1954 he was a research fellow in chemistry with Linus Pauling at Gates and Crellin Laboratories at Caltech. He served as chief of the section on physical chemistry at the National Institute of Mental Health from 1954 to 1958  and was a visiting scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge  England  from 1955 to 1956. From 1969 to 1980  Rich was an investigator in NASA’s Viking mission to Mars  working on experiments designed to look for life on that planet.He joined the MIT faculty in 1958  and mentored generations of students.“Alex was a bright beacon and a good mentor ” says Shuguang Zhang  a principal research scientist at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms who worked closely with Rich. “The most important thing Alex taught us is open-mindedness. Open-mindedness opened a new world for each one of us.”“Alex was an inspirational scientist ” Schwartz adds. “Always keen on solving the next scientific puzzle  always keen on figuring out the latest technology to move forward. His curiosity was second to none.”High honorsIn 1995  Rich received the National Medal of Science  the highest scientific honor bestowed by the U.S. government. His many other awards and honors include election to the National Academy of Sciences  the Philosophical Society  the French Academy of Sciences  the Russian Academy of Sciences  and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Rich was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and  in 1976  was appointed by President Gerald Ford to a six-year term on the U.S. National Science Board.In 1980  Rich was presented with MIT’s James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award  given for extraordinary professional accomplishments by faculty members. He won the $250 000 Bower Award for Achievement in Science in 2000  was presented with Sigma Xi’s William Procter Prize for Academic Achievement in 2001  and was awarded the Lomonosov Large Gold Medal from the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2002. In 2008 he was named the 38th recipient of the $300 000 Welch Award in Chemistry.He received several honorary degrees  as well as the Rosenstiel Award in Basic Biomedical Research and the Presidential Award of the New York Academy of Sciences.Rich is survived by his wife  Jane; two sons  Josiah and Benjamin; two daughters  Jessica and Rebecca; and seven grandchildren: Abigail  Rachel  Abraham  Nola  Nicholas  Cyrus  and Zachary.A memorial gathering will be held on Sunday  May 3  at the Norton Woods Conference Center  200 Beacon St.  Somerville  Mass.  from 1-5 p.m.
Professor Emeritus Benjamin Lax dies at 99,Professor Emeritus Benjamin Lax of the MIT Department of Physics passed away on April 21 at the age of 99.Born December 29  1915  in Miskolc  Hungary  Lax came to New York City as a boy and received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Cooper Union in 1941.During World War II  Lax enlisted in the U.S. Army  where  after completing officer candidate school and other training  he was assigned to the radar laboratory at MIT. While there  he was in charge of putting together a new radar system  dubbed “Little Abner ” for field testing. After the end of the war  he pursued a PhD degree in plasma physics at MIT  receiving his degree in 1949.He joined the MIT Lincoln Laboratories in 1951  later becoming head of the solid-state physics division in 1958  and associate director of the laboratory in 1964.While at Lincoln Laboratory he made major contributions to the understanding of semiconductors  particularly through studies of their energy band structure using cyclotron resonance. He was also a co-inventor on an early patent for a semiconductor laser. His pioneering work on semiconductors provided an important foundation for the development of semiconductor technology now used in computers  cell phones  and other high-technology devices.In the late 1950s  while working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory  Lax led a group of scientists and engineers who proposed a high magnetic field laboratory on the MIT campus for research in solid-state physics  plasma physics  magnetic resonance spectroscopy  and engineering. The proposal was accepted  the National Magnet Laboratory (NML) was established in 1960  and Lax served as its director for its first 21 years. He also became a professor in the MIT Department of Physics.With Lax at the helm  the NML was an international leader in a remarkably wide range of research areas including the physics of solids in high magnetic fields; high magnetic-field nuclear magnetic resonance: studies of magnetic fields of the brain; and the use of high magnetic fields for plasma physics and magnetic-confinement fusion research. The first high magnetic field tokamak confinement device  Alcator  was constructed and operated at the NML; the results obtained were a major advance in nuclear fusion research. Eventually  the research on plasma physics and fusion energy required a larger facility  leading to the establishment of the MIT Plasma Fusion Center.Lax was also active in teaching and training PhD students. He was a mentor to many young research scientists who gained valuable experience conducting research at the NML and went on to become international leaders in the fields of solid-state and plasma physics. He retired from the directorship of the NML — by then the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory and today the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory — in 1981 and from the physics faculty in 1986.Among the honors and awards that he received were the Oliver E. Buckley Prize for condensed matter physics of the American Physical Society in 1960 and election to the National Academy of Sciences. He was the author of over 300 journal articles  and co-author of a classic book on microwave ferrites and ferromagnetics.Following his retirement from the Magnet Laboratory and the physics faculty  he stayed active in physics for more the 15 years  including being a consultant at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.Lax  who had lived in Newton  Massachusetts  was the husband of the late Blossom Cohen Lax  the father of Daniel R. Lax of Atlanta  and Robert M. Lax of Newton  and the grandfather of Rachael Lax Day.
Norman B. Leventhal ’38  visionary developer and philanthropist  dies at 97,Norman B. Leventhal ’38 — a visionary developer and philanthropist at the center of Boston’s postwar revival  and a conscience of its civic life — died Sunday at age 97. Leventhal was a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation  and a vital member of the Institute community throughout his decades as an alumnus.As a co-founder of the firm that became the Beacon Companies  Leventhal was a driving force behind the construction of many of Boston’s signature buildings and public spaces  including Rowes Wharf  Center Plaza  the renovated South Station  the park at Post Office Square  and 75 State Street  among others.Equipped with a keen eye for all angles of urban life  Leventhal was a strong advocate of public spaces and amenities for all city residents. He conceived of and built the park at Post Office Square — now named Norman B. Leventhal Park — while his firm also constructed thousands of units of affordable housing in the Boston area.“We must constantly work to find ways to make the riches of Boston available to all of her citizens  not just the most fortunate among us ” Leventhal told theBoston Globein 1997.Leventhal was widely known as a tireless benefactor to a wide variety of institutions  including MIT  the Boston Public Library  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  and many other institutions and causes.“Norman was a marvel: bold  brilliant  a visionary in his industry and an incredible public citizen  but so humble  so charming  so interested to know you — so interested in everything ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif said. “We are tremendously grateful for his service and generosity to the Institute — and for the power of his wonderful example. I could not be prouder to say that Norman Leventhal was a graduate of MIT.”Alan Leventhal  one of Norman Leventhal’s sons and a member of the MIT Corporation  said that the Institute had a profound influence on his father’s life.“In his self-effacing way  until the day he died  Sunday  he believed that if not for MIT  he would not have had the success he had in his life ” Alan Leventhal said. Norman Leventhal  he added  emerged from the Great Depression determined to “improve the quality of life for citizens in the community ” and spent much of his life thereafter mindful of working for the public good.Building a life – and a legacyNorman Bernard Leventhal was born Aug. 30  1917  and grew up in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester  the child of a Russian father and Lithuanian mother who had immigrated to the U.S. From a young age he was a superb student  and graduated from the prestigious Boston Latin School at age 15. Though admitted to Harvard University  Leventhal attended MIT partly because the Institute offered him a scholarship.A civil engineering student as an undergraduate  Leventhal worked three jobs while attending MIT. After graduating in 1938  he became a naval architect during World War II  and co-founded the Beacon Construction Co. in 1946 with his brother  Robert.Leventhal married Muriel Guren in 1941. In an interview withMIT Technology Reviewpublished in 2008  he described his greatest accomplishment simply as “marrying Muriel.”Beacon Construction Co. grew significantly in the post-World War II years by tackling an array of projects across the U.S.  from remodeling stores to building post offices and constructing public and military housing. The firm’s first large-scale project in Boston  one of which Leventhal remained especially proud  was Center Plaza  the long  curving office building in Boston’s Government Center  completed in 1969.His work on South Station  as part of a public-private partnership  preserved the station’s striking neoclassical facade — a city landmark — while successfully rejuvenating the interior as a transit hub  public space  and setting for commerce. The renovated station opened in 1989.Norman B. Leventhal Park  in Post Office Square  was the culmination of a decade-long effort to construct a new green space in the middle of Boston’s financial district. Leventhal spearheaded a public-private partnership that demolished an old parking garage on the site  built a new one underground  and designed the nearly two-acre park  which opened in 1992. It was named for Leventhal in 1997.An inveterate walker who loved taking in the city on foot  Leventhal had one of Boston’s historic downtown walks named in his honor. The trail from Beacon Hill to Long Wharf was renamed the “Norman B. Leventhal Walk to the Sea” in 2008  dedicated by then-mayor Thomas Menino.Leventhal saw philanthropy as an integral part of his life. He supported Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  of which he was a longtime board member  and a variety of other causes  including the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston.Among Leventhal’s most distinctive gifts was the establishment of the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library. Leventhal produced a book  “Mapping Boston ” published in 1999 by the MIT Press  which displayed and detailed key elements of his unique collection of maps of the city.Leventhal was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and was awarded honorary degrees from Boston University  Brandeis University  and Hebrew College. He was a director emeritus of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation  an overseer of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston  and a trustee of Boston’s Museum of Science.An institution at the InstituteLeventhal’s relationship with MIT remained strong and active during the three-quarters of a century he spent as an alumnus of the Institute. He served as president of the Alumni Association in 1977-78  and in 1978 was given the Bronze Beaver Award  the highest award granted by the Alumni Association for service to the Institute. He served on the MIT Corporation from 1975 to 2015  including service on the Executive Committee from 1990 to 1992.The Leventhals also helped create the Muriel and Norman B. Leventhal Center for Jewish Life at MIT  a resource for MIT’s Jewish community and the campus as a whole.In addition  Leventhal served on many visiting committees  which evaluate components of the Institute. He chaired the Architecture and Planning visiting committee from 1976 to 1988  working with the likes of architect Denise Scott Brown and the architectural critic Ada Louis Huxtable.“He had a great interest in art and architecture ” said Alan Leventhal  noting that his father’s intellectual interests were well served by his committee work at MIT. “He had an enthusiasm that never left him.”In 1989  the Leventhals established the Norman B. (1938) and Muriel Leventhal Fund to support a professorship in the School of Architecture and Planning in the field of city-building and large-scale urban environments. Intellectually  Leventhal’s interest in maps and urban geography also put him on common ground with some of MIT’s most influential faculty in architecture and planning  who had created innovative studies of our visual perceptions of cities and urban spaces.Leventhal also served on the visiting committee for Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences from 1992 to 1999; the visiting committee for Architecture from 1999 to 2015; the visiting committee for Civil and Environmental Engineering from 1968 to 1974 and from 1998 to 2015; and the visiting committee for Urban Studies and Planning from 1992 to 2015.“Norman was passionate about Boston as a city  about making it a better place for everyone else ” said Adèle Naudé Santos  who got to know Leventhal while serving as dean of MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning from 2004-2014. She added: “He really cared about good urban planning  and the quality of our urban environment.”Additionally  he was a member of the MIT Corporation’s Development Committee from 1970 to 2015 (serving in an honorary capacity after 1990); the Investment Committee from 1988 to 1992; and the Membership Committee from 1985 to 1990.Fellowships for doctoral candidates from underrepresented minority groups  in the sciences and engineering  were also named in honor of Leventhal by outside donors.Leventhal is survived by his wife  Muriel; his sons  Alan and Mark; his daughter  Paula Sidman; 11 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.A memorial service will be held in Kresge Auditorium on Wednesday  April 22  from 10:30 a.m. to noon  with a luncheon immediately following in the Johnson Athletics Center.
Claude Brenner dies at 86 ,Claude Brenner  former MIT Corporation member  former president of the MIT Alumni Association  and longtime member of the MIT community  died on Saturday  March 7  in Cambridge  Massachusetts. He was 86.Brenner was born in South Africa on July 7  1928. As a boy in the late summer of 1939 — just 10 days before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland — Brenner and his mother moved to Chicago  where they ended up spending the next nine years.During this time  Brenner was recruited to become a cast member of the popular radio show “Quiz Kids ” which featured a panel of precocious children answering trivia questions on the air. Known for his eloquence and a strong command of topics in aeronautics  Brenner was such a popular figure that he was asked to substitute for the radio show’s host on four occasions.His role on “Quiz Kids” eventually helped Brenner secure admission to the Lake Forest Academy boarding school  from where he graduated in 1944 at age 15. He matriculated at MIT that fall and went on to earn an SB degree in 1947 and an MS in 1948  both from the Department of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering.Upon completing his MIT education  Brenner returned briefly to South Africa before moving to the U.K. for a job with de Havilland Aircraft Company. But he soon came back to the United States  where he built a career consulting on topics from aircraft design and performance to nuclear warfare and defense electronics to laser systems and renewable energy. Brenner settled in Lexington  Massachusetts  where he lived with his family for 38 years.Throughout his life  Brenner remained a committed MIT ambassador and community member. He served  for instance  as a member of the MIT Corporation and as president of the MIT Alumni Association. He was president of the Class of 1947 up until his death  and had also served on the Educational Council  the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT) and some 70-plus other MIT boards and committees.In addition  Brenner remained involved in the activities of his former department; most recently  he helped in the planning of theAeroAstro centennial celebrationat MIT this past fall. He was also very active in Jewish matters on campus as the MIT Hillel Board chairman and was a founding member of MIT Hillel Foundation.For his efforts as a volunteer with the MIT Alumni Association  Brenner received the Bronze Beaver Award  the highest honor bestowed upon alumni volunteers by the Alumni Association. Brenner proudly wore his bronze beaver lapel pin whenever he came to the MIT campus.A mentor and friend to many  Brenner took pleasure in spending time with his family  volunteering at MIT  solving English cryptics puzzles  patronizing the arts  attending lectures at the Boston Athenaeum  traveling  and cogitating over all things mathematical. He was an ardent New England sports fan  and was particularly passionate about the Red Sox and Patriots.Brenner was well known for telling stories and jokes; he shared memorable moments of his life in oral histories recorded by the MIT Libraries in2008and2009. He was also a fervent champion of recycling and energy conservation.Brenner is survived by his companion of 14 years  Anne Lowell; son Paul T. Brenner; daughter Harriet P. Severino; grandchildren Taylor  Eric  Brock  and Alisand; and the children of his late sister Sheila Lang  David and Roberta.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the Lake Forest Academy Fund-Claude Brenner Memorial  1500 West Kennedy Road Lake Forest  Illinois 60045 or to MIT for theClaude W.

BCS Professor Emeritus Stephan Chorover dies at 82,Professor Emeritus Stephan Chorover  a founding member of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences  passed away on Friday  Feb. 20  at age 82. His more than 50 years at MIT were marked by a passion for social justice  innovation in educational practices  and a love of philosophical inquiry.Chorover graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1950. He received his Bachelor of Science from City College of New York in 1955 and a PhD in neuropsychology from New York University in 1959. Trained as a physiological psychologist  his early research focused on learning and memory in animals  and interactions between the central nervous system  human behavior  and socioenvironmental contexts. While at MIT  he became increasingly interested in human systems in composite biological  psychological  and social terms.He was a strong advocate against the misuse of psychology and neuroscience as means of sociopolitical control  which he explored in his book  "From Genesis to Genocide: The Meaning of Human Nature and the Power of Behavior Control." Chorover became an oft-cited opponent of the use of psychosurgery  especially as a treatment of violent prisoners and indigent populations. His interest in the social context of behavior control motivated his research focus on social psychology during later years.Chorover's commitment to students began during the early days of his MIT career  where he was instrumental in creating the department's first academic programs. Over the years he taught and mentored thousands of undergraduate and graduate students. A proponent of collaborative learning in higher education  he built that perspective into his teaching at MIT  focusing on how human societies interrelate with environmental systems. Chorover sought to enhance his students’ understanding of the human and ecological implications of their scientific research. He retired in 1998 but continued teaching9.70 (Social Psychology) and9.68 (Affect: Aspects of Feelings) to MIT undergraduate students for an additional 15 years.He served on several MIT committees tasked with improving the Institute's curriculum and student life  and in 1996 co-authored a study of the first-year experience at MIT with his 9.70 students. He also served for several years on the editorial board of the MIT faculty newsletter  and was a member of the Second Committee on Women Faculty in the School of Science.He is survived by his beloved wife of 62 years  Bea  and three children: Nora (and partner Steve Cooley)  Jon (and wife Gina Gargano)  and Katya (and husband John Grandt); as well as four grandchildren  Talia  Nathan  Sarah  and Annaluna.A memorial will be held in the MIT Chapel on March 14 from 12:30-2:30 p.m.
Philanthropist Erna Viterbi dies at 81,Erna Viterbi  a warm and gracious philanthropist who with her husband  Qualcomm co-founder Andrew ’56  SM ’57  gave generously to MIT and a variety of other institutions  died Feb. 17 in San Diego.“In the long adventure of their lives together  Erna and Andrew were terrific partners — curious  generous  thoughtful  and creative in everything they did ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. “Erna brightened every encounter and enriched every conversation. It was a delight to know her  and I am deeply grateful for her friendship and for everything she did for MIT.”At MIT  the Viterbis established endowed professorships and fellowships for graduate students in the departments of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering. Four faculty members and more than 40 students on campus have benefited directly from their generosity. Together with her husband  Viterbi has also given generously to undergraduate scholarships to help MIT maintain its need-blind admissions policy.“We are deeply sorrowful for Erna’s passing ” says Douglas A. Lauffenburger  the Ford Professor of Bioengineering and head of the Department of Biological Engineering. “She had a magnificent spirit and was a wonderful partner with Andrew in their extraordinary support for the faculty and students of our MIT biological engineering program.”“Andrew and Erna Viterbi have given us a tremendous opportunity to honor the very best faculty and graduate students ” adds Anantha P. Chandrakasan  the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor of Electrical Engineering and head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Their support also allows our faculty and students to explore new research directions that are perhaps not as easy to fund in other ways.”Daniela Rus  one of three current Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professors at MIT  says the family’s support has helped her to explore new ideas at the intersection of communication  control  and computation. “Erna was always so warm. I am so grateful I had a chance to know her ” says Rus  who is also the director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.The Viterbis have also been involved in other aspects of MIT community life. For example  last November the two attended MIT Hillel’s “Leading Jewish Minds @ MIT” faculty luncheon program  at which Andrew Viterbi spoke about the evolution of technology over his career; the couple had the opportunity to interact with the many Viterbi scholars and fellows who attended the event. “Erna was such a gracious person ” remembers Rabbi Michelle H. Fisher  executive director of MIT Hillel  which the Viterbis have also helped to support. “At another event I attended with her  I remember how interested she was both in sharing her own story and in hearing mine.”According to published accounts of her life  Erna Finci Viterbi was born in Sarajevo  a descendant of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain. In 1941  during World War II  the Finci family fled German-occupied Yugoslavia for the Italian-occupied zone from which they were deported and interned in the Parma region of Italy. In 1943  when the Nazis occupied Italy  the family was saved from deportation to extermination camps by the people of Gramignazzo di Sissa  the village where they had been interned. Other Italians helped them escape to Switzerland  where they waited out the war.In 1950  the Finci family resettled in California  where Erna met Andrew Viterbi; the two were married in 1958. “She became his equal lifetime partner  sharing in all major decisions and she was usually by his side as he scribbled notes on communication theory at home or at family gatherings ” according to the Andrew J. and Erna Viterbi Family Archives at the University of Southern California.Erna Viterbi is survived by her husband  Andrew; son  Alan; daughter  Audrey; and five grandchildren.

Jack Ruina dies at 91,Jack Ruina  professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1963 to 1997 and emeritus thereafter  died on Feb. 4 at the age of 91.Emigrating from Poland in 1926 at age three and a half  Jack Ruina grew up  as the youngest of nine children  in Brooklyn  New York  eventually attending the City College of New York. Following receipt of his PhD degree in electrical engineering from the Poytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1948  Ruina joined the faculty at Brown University. As his interests in defense-related areas increased  Ruina joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1953. While on leave from the University of Illinois  Ruina served in several senior positions at the Department of Defense’s radar division in the Control Systems Laboratory and as Director of Defense Research and Engineering in the Air Force and Assistant Director for Air Defense.For nearly three years  starting in 1961  Jack Ruina was the director of Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA  now called DARPA  in the Defense Department under President John F. Kennedy and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Some projects under Ruina’s supervision at the time included development of technologies for seismic detection of nuclear tests  contributing to the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963; research on missile-defense systems and radar; andhiring J.C.R. Lickliderin creating the project that would become ARPANET  one of three early progenitors of the global Internet.Also from 1961 to 1963 under Ruina’s direction  ARPA funded the Arecibo Observatory  a huge radio telescope in Puerto Rico  and sponsored JASON  an independent group of scientists to advise the government on science-related policy issues. For his work as director of ARPA  Ruina received in 1962 the Flemming Award for One of Ten Outstanding Young Men in Government.Jack Ruina joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT in 1963. In 1964 he was granted a leave to accept the presidency of the Institute for Defense Analysis  a non-profit research institution sponsored by a consortium of 12 universities including MIT.Along with several MIT figures including Jerome Wiesner  Ruina was involved in the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs  a series of conferences between U.S. and Soviet scientists intended to advance arms-control negotiations between the two countries. As noted in an MIT Newsarticle about Pugwashon the occasion of being selected for the1995 Nobel Peace Prize  Ruina is noted for “making the initial and very controversial proposal for an ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) treaty at a Pugwash conference.”Ultimately his idea helped to motivate the 1972 SALT I Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty — as noted by Cornell Professor Matthew Evangelista in his 2002 book  “Unarmed Forces: The Transnational Movement to end the Cold War.”From 1966 to 1970  Ruina served as vice president for special labs (Lincoln and Draper Laboratories). He was also instrumental in founding the MIT Defense and Arms Control Studies Program — now called theSecurity Studies Program— and he served as its first director. Ruina served on government committees including a presidential appointment to the General Advisory Committee from 1969 to 1977 and acted as senior consultant to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1977 to 1980.  He was the editor — with Jeffrey Porro and Carl Kaysen — of the 1988 book “The Nuclear Age Reader.”Jack Ruina was also a member of the board of directors of the MITRE Corporation.On his death at Sunrise at Friendship Heights in Chevy Chase  Maryland  he is survived by his children  Ellen Ruina  of Washington  D.C.; Andy Ruina of Ithaca  New York; Rachel Ruina of Washington  D.C.; and seven grandchildren. His wife  Edith Elster Ruina  died in 2005.A memorial ceremony for Jack Ruina will be held at 11 a.m. on March 28 inBuilding W20(Stratton Student Center) in the third-floor Mezzanine Lounge. Those interested in attending should contact Andy Ruina atruina@cornell.edu.Gifts in memory of Ruina may be made to MIT for theJack and Edith Ruina Fund for Private Music Lessons(account # 3179200) or theRuina Nuclear Age Speaker Series Fund(account #3255710).

Irving Singer  professor emeritus of philosophy  dies at 89,Irving Singer  a professor emeritus of philosophy at MIT  died Feb. 1 at age 89. Singer was an eminent philosopher whose academic career spanned 65 years — with more than half a century as a professor at MIT.Singer was the author of 21 books in the field of humanistic philosophy  focusing on topics such as the philosophy of love  the nature of creativity  moral issues  aesthetics  and philosophy in literature  music  and film. His works have been translated into Korean  Chinese  Japanese  and Spanish  among other languages.The MIT Press recently honored Singer’s career by initiating “The Irving Singer Library ” which includes republication of his books including "The Nature of Love " volumes 1  2  and 3  and "Meaning in Life " volumes 1  2  and 3; "Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film"; "Ingmar Bergman  Cinematic Philosopher: Reflections on his Creativity"; "Mozart and Beethoven: The Concept of Love in Their Operas"; and "Modes of Creativity: Philosophical Perspectives." Other books by Singer include "George Santayana  Literary Philosopher"; and "Santayana’s Aesthetics: A Critical Analysis." A manuscript in progress at the time of Singer’s death was titled “Creativity in the Brain.”A three-day conference in 1991 focusing on Singer’s work generated a book titled "The Nature and Pursuit of Love: The Philosophy of Irving Singer " edited by David Goicoechea (Prometheus Books  1995).Samuel Jay Keyser  a professor emeritus of linguistics who had an office next door to Singer’s in MIT's Stata Center  remembered his colleague fondly: “We were good office friends  and I am so sorry to hear he has passed on. It is the end of an era.”Singer retired from MIT in 2013  having served on the MIT faculty in the Department of Philosophy and Linguistics (and its forerunners) since 1958. Until age 85  he was still actively teaching. Singer enjoyed teaching immensely  appreciating it as integral to his process of developing ideas that would inform his writing projects. Several of Singer’s course lectures are viewable on MIT OpenCourseWare  on topics including “Philosophy in Film and Other Media”; “Feeling and Imagination in Art  Science  and Technology”; and “The Nature of Creativity.”Timothy Madigan  an associate professor of philosophy at St. John Fisher College  recalled Singer’s influence on his work: “Irving was a role model to me  and a true exemplar of a man of wisdom. He will be greatly missed  but his works will continue to live on.”Early yearsBorn in Brooklyn to the late Isadore and Nettie Singer  who emigrated from Austria-Hungary and owned a grocery store in Coney Island  Singer graduated from Townsend Harris High School at age 15  having skipped three grades. After beginning undergraduate studies at Brooklyn College  Singer served in World War II.Recognizing his skill as a writer  the Army selected Singer to chronicle his infantry’s activities  culminating in a document titled "History of the 210th Field Artillery Group" (U.S. Army  1945). In his later years he wrote a book  currently unpublished  titled: “Memories of World War II "which included letters home to his brother Mark.Singer studied at Biarritz American University in France in the months after the war  and then  as a beneficiary of the GI Bill  completed his AB at Harvard University  where he graduated summa cum laudein 1948 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In Biarritz he met David Wheeler  who would become a renowned Boston theater director; the two became roommates at Harvard  as well as lifelong friends.Singer went on to graduate studies at Oxford University and Harvard  earning a PhD in philosophy at Harvard in 1952. Singer joined the MIT faculty after appointments at Harvard  Cornell University  the University of Michigan  and Johns Hopkins University.Singer was awarded a Fulbright research scholar grant (1955-56  Paris)  a Guggenheim fellowship (1965-66)  and a Rockefeller Foundation grant (1970  London). He was a fellow of Villa I Tatti  Harvard's center for Italian Renaissance studies in Florence  for two years  from 1965 to 1967.Singer’s knowledge and love of opera led to a friendship with Leonard Bernstein  beginning during the composer and conductor’s 1973 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard. Bernstein thanked Singer for his academic contributions in the book resulting from that famous series of lectures.Singer was predeceased by his wife  Josephine Fisk Singer  who passed away on Oct. 1  2014. He leaves four children — Anne  Margaret  Emily  and Ben — four grandchildren  and five nephews and nieces.A memorial service is being planned for later this year at MIT.
James L. Kinsey  former chair of chemistry department  passes away at 80,James L. Kinsey  the former head of the Department of Chemistry at MIT and the D. R. Bullard-Welch Foundation Professor of Science Emeritus at Rice University  died unexpectedly on Dec. 20. He was 80.Kinsey was born in Paris  Texas  in 1934. He earned a BA from Rice in 1956 and continued at that institution for graduate studies  earning a PhD in physical chemistry in 1959 under Robert F. Curl  who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996. The title of Kinsey’s dissertation was “The Microwave Spectrum of Chlorine Dioxide.”In 1959 and 1960  Kinsey spent one year at the University of Uppsala in Sweden as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the Quantum Chemistry Institute. He then spent a year in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley as a Miller Research Fellow.In 1962  Kinsey was appointed as an assistant professor of chemistry at MIT  where he served for 26 years  rising through the tenure ranks. He succeeded John Deutch  now an Institute Professor  as head of the Department of Chemistry in 1977  and held that position until 1982.“Jim Kinsey mentored me from the time I was a graduate student ” Deutch says. “He tried to teach me group theory and 3j coupling coefficients  but failed. His knowledge and devotion to chemistry was unmatched. Throughout his career  he made great contributions to MIT  Rice  and the Welch Foundation. One of my oldest and trusted friends is gone  and I grieve for the loss.”Kinsey was known for his novel studies of the dynamics of disintegrating molecules using various spectroscopic techniques  including his significant advance of Fourier transform doppler spectroscopy and  with Robert W. Field  the development of stimulated emission pumping. He was also much admired for his leadership skills and his unpretentious disposition.“Jim and I had a wonderful collaboration ” says Field  the Robert T. Haslam and Bradley Dewey Professor of Chemistry. “We were so different in our scientific styles  our relationships with members of our joint research group  and in how we would approach and finish off a problem. … Jim was analytical; I was intuitive. Jim was cautious; I was not. … We created magic between us  and shared the joy of knowing that we had created some new truth.”“Our cross-department collaboration involved two joint PhDs  two [undergraduate researchers]  one future Nobel Prize winner  a lot of brown-bag lunches  and the delight of both scientific and personal insights — including that Jim and I shared the same birthday ” says Dave Pritchard  the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics. “I was having lunch with him about a month ago  when — typically — he had to rush off to do something for a former student.”David Jonas PhD '92  a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder  says  “Jim Kinsey was a wonderful co-advisor. I benefited tremendously from his gentle and seemingly effortless approach to resolving contested scientific questions and fondly recall his mischievous sense of humor. I will always remember Jim as a great human being.”Sylvia Ceyer  current head of the Department of Chemistry and the John C. Sheehan Professor of Chemistry  recalls  “Jim was the chemistry department head who hired me as an assistant professor in 1981. From that moment on  Jim became a beloved mentor and friend who selflessly and carefully read and valuably commented on many of my early proposals and papers  even though the subject matter was not centered in his own research interests. I know that I am a much better scientist because of Jim.”She adds  “Jim Kinsey was so incredibly smart  but more importantly  so profoundly wise. He had a knack for quickly spotting the heart of an issue and deftly employing his dry wit to rapidly build a consensus. Listening to the clever repartee of Jim  Bob Silbey  John Deutch  Irwin Oppenheim  and John Waugh is a most cherished MIT memory.”In 1988  Kinsey took early retirement from MIT and returned to Rice  his alma mater  where he served as dean of the Wiess School of Natural Sciences for 10 years. In addition  he served Rice's interim provost from 1993 to 1994.“Jim Kinsey came to Rice with a vision for what we could be  and set about in a determined fashion to bring that view into the reality we see today ” says Kathleen Matthews  who succeeded Kinsey as dean of the Wiess School. “But no discussion of him would ignore his wit and sense of humor.”Kinsey made frequent return visits to MIT while serving as a member of the MIT Chemistry Department Visiting Committee from 1994 to 2006.Kinsey served as chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Robert A. Welch Foundation from 2006 to 2012. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and received the E.O. Lawrence Award of the Department of Energy and the Earle K. Plyler Prize of the American Physical Society. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He and Field were honored as mentors of their joint student Yonqin Chen  who received the American Chemical Society’s Nobel Laureate Signature Prize in Graduate Education.There will be a memorial at Rice University in the Keck Lecture Hall (old chemistry lecture hall) on Saturday  Feb. 28  at 2 p.m.  with a reception to follow at Brochstein Pavilion.
Former AeroAstro head and Air Force chief scientist Eugene Covert dies at 88,Professor Emeritus Eugene Covert  a renowned aerodynamicist  aerospace engineer  and engineering educator  passed away Jan. 15 at age 88.Covert is credited with devising the world’s first practical wind-tunnel magnetic-suspension system. He also served on the commission that investigated the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger  and received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal  one of the most prestigious awards in aviation.Covert’s career spanned research to teaching to public service.Born on Feb. 6  1926  in Rapid City  S.D.  Covert received his BS at age 20 from the University of Minnesota. He immediately went to work for the Naval Air Modification Unit’s Pilotless Aircraft Division on projects that would result in the Sparrow  the West’s famed primary air-to-air missile from the 1950s through the 1990s.In 1948  he received an SM  also from the University of Minnesota  and in 1958 he earned an ScD from MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.Throughout the 1950s  Covert conducted tests on numerous aircraft  including the famed F-4 Phantom  at the MIT Naval Supersonic Laboratory. His interest in the problems of supporting models during supersonic wind-tunnel tests led him to develop the world’s first practical wind-tunnel magnetic-suspension system.Covert joined the AeroAstro faculty in 1963 as an associate professor. He became a full professor in 1968 and served as head of AeroAstro from 1985 until 1990. He became a professor emeritus in June 1996.Between 1972 and 1973  Covert served as chief scientist of the U.S. Air Force  a three-star equivalent civilian position  advising the Air Force Chief of Staff and the Secretary of the Air Force on science and technology issues.From 1978 to 1979  Covert was technical director of the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development.On Jan. 28  1986  Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into its flight  killing its seven crew members. Shortly thereafter  President Ronald Regan created acommission to investigatethe disaster. Covert was one of 14 individuals appointed to the commission  which was chaired by former Secretary of State William P. Rogers and included Neil Armstrong  Sally Ride  Richard Feynman  and Chuck Yeager. The commission’s work resulted in a substantial redesign of the shuttle’s boosters and the creation of a new NASA safety office.Covert was a fellow and an honorary fellow of several learned societies  and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. His awards include the AGARD Von Karman Medal  the AIAA Ground Testing Award  the AIAA Durand Lectureship  and the U.S. Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Medal.Covert identified the high point of his career as his 2006 nomination for one of the most prestigious awards in aviation: the Daniel Guggenheim Medal. Jointly sponsored by the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics  the American Society of Mechanical Engineering  the American Helicopter Society  and the Society of Automotive Engineers  the medal recognizes those who have made profound contributions to advancing aeronautics. Targeting Covert for the award — a large gold disk that bears the image of theSpirit of St. Louis— the Guggenheim committee cited his “exemplary leadership in aeronautics teaching and research  development of significant state-of-the-art aerodynamic testing techniques  and outstanding contributions to public service.” Other Guggenheim recipients have included Orville Wright  Igor Sikorsky  James “Jimmy” Doolittle  and Charles Lindbergh.Reflecting on his life following the announcement of the Guggenheim honor  Covert mused  “It was like being in a batting cage. I missed a fair fraction  but I took a swing at everything.” Known as much for his dry wit as his technical abilities  he added  “In the course of my career  I have had the opportunity to visit many places in the United States and throughout the world  including the South Pole  where I have met many very friendly  intelligent  and interesting people. The exception was the North Pole  where we had to bring our own people."“Gene was a true giant in our field " says AeroAstro department head Jaime Peraire  the H. N. Slater Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics. "His career in research  education  and service and his mentoring of students and faculty was a model for many of us.”Peraire adds  “Until recently  Gene was a regular at our weekly faculty lunch seminars  always ready with an insightful question or observation for the speaker. His passing has saddened the AeroAstro community  but the universal sentiment is that it was a privilege to know him.”Covert’s wife of 67 years  Mary (Rutford) Covert  predeceased him by a year. He leaves a son  David H. Covert  and daughter-in-law  Rhoda  of Arlington  Mass.; a daughter  Christine J. Covert  and son-in-law  Gray Parrot  of Hancock  Maine; a daughter  Pamela C. Spicer  and son-in-law  Richard Spicer  of Franklin  Mass; and a son  Steven P. Covert  and daughter-in-law  Diane  of Belmont  Mass. He is also survived by four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Donations in Covert’s name may be made to theArthritis Foundationor toRosie’s Placein Boston.
Professor emeritus Richard Schafer  former deputy head of mathematics at MIT  dies at 96,Richard D. Schafer  emeritus professor and former deputy head of the MIT Department of Mathematics  died on Dec. 28  2014. He was 96.Schafer joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1959 as deputy head under department head William Ted Martin. The department had seen a period of rapid growth of faculty and postdoctoral programs in the ’50s  with expanding demands in teaching and graduate supervision. As deputy head  Schafer was instrumental in organizing the application and review processes of the relatively new CLE Moore Instructorship program  and in systemizing the assignment of teaching and the scheduling of classes with the Office of the Registrar. He stepped down as deputy head when Ted Martin ended his tenure as department head in 1968  but he stayed on at MIT until his retirement in 1988 as professor emeritus.Schafer was an algebraist  an expert in non-associative algebras. He did collaborative work with fellow mathematician Claude Chevalley on Lie algebras and extensive work on Jordan algebras. In 1966  Schafer published “Introduction to Nonassociative Algebras” (Academic Press)  a book that has served as a standard reference for many years.Schafer was born in Buffalo  New York  in 1918. He received both a BA and an MA from the University of Buffalo  and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1942. Between 1942 and 1945 he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve.Upon his return to academia in 1945  Schafer took a yearlong appointment as an instructor at the University of Michigan. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1946-48 and later from 1958-59. He joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in 1948  and moved to the University of Connecticut as a full professor in 1953  where he served as department head until joining MIT in 1959. From 1955-58  Schafer also served as associate secretary of the eastern region of the American Mathematical Society.In 2013  Schafer was elected to join the inaugural class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society. He had been active for 50 years in the Mathematical Association of America and Phi Beta Kappa.A lifelong opera fan  Schafer regularly traveled to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and to the Salzburg Festival in Germany. For 67 years  he was married to the late Alice T.

He was 79.Ezekiel was born in Baghdad  and moved to London with his family in 1948. He received a BS in electrical engineering from Imperial College London in 1957. After working for General Electric for two years  he moved to Montreal in 1959 to work for Canadian Aviation Electronics.Following a year in Australia  Ezekiel joined MIT as a graduate student in 1962  receiving an SM in 1964 and ScD in 1968  both in aeronautics and astronautics. He was appointed as an assistant professor in AeroAstro in 1968 and a full professor in AeroAstro and in electrical engineering 10 years later. He taught classes in dynamics  optics  laser fundamentals  basics of measurement systems  and optical sensors.In 1986  Ezekiel was appointed director of the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Study.Ezekiel’s research interests were in the fields of lasers and optics and their applications in atom-field interactions; ultra-high resolution spectroscopy; optical frequency/wavelength standards; and sensors  including optical/fiberoptical gyroscopes  magnetic field sensors  and spectroscopic sensors. He exploited nonlinear optical effects to create a variety of new sensors and optical devices  and novel high frequency sources.AeroAstro department head Jaime Peraire says that “Ziggy ” as Ezekiel liked to be called  “brought unique electrical engineering expertise to the AeroAstro department — skills we lacked before his arrival.”“His energy and enthusiasm were boundless and contagious ” Peraire says. “He was universally liked and will be terribly missed.”EECS professor Erich Ippen  a principal investigator in the Research Laboratory of Electronics  says  “Ziggy had a marvelous ability to engage students  demonstrate laser phenomena with simple experiments  and make complicated concepts seem intuitive. Always upbeat and positive  he was active professionally well into retirement. Everyone who knew him  discussed laser physics with him  attended one of his classes  or saw him ballroom dancing has fond memories. We already miss him.”Honors Ezekiel received included fellowships in the Optical Society of America  the American Physical Society  and the International Society of Optical Engineering. He enjoyed squash  racquetball  ballroom dancing  bicycling  walking  theater  ballet  symphony  opera  and traveling.Ezekiel leaves his wife  Suzanne (Courtright) of Medford  Mass.; daughters Annette Kogan  of New York  and Rosalie Poelker  of Atlanta; and five grandchildren.Donations may be made to the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in the name of Ziggy Ezekiel. Donations also may be made in his memory to the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
Herman Eisen  professor emeritus of biology  dies at 96,Herman Eisen  a professor emeritus of biology and founding member of the MIT Center for Cancer Research  died Nov. 2 at age 96.Over a 70-year career  Eisen forged a path as a pioneering immunologist whose research has significantly shaped the field. He joined the MIT faculty in 1973  having been recruited as a founding member of MIT’s Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research).Eisen retired from MIT in 1989  albeit only in the official sense: As a professor emeritus  he maintained an active laboratory and continued to research  publish  and advise students and postdocs until his passing. In all  Eisen spent 41 years at MIT  during which he taught  mentored  and collaborated with thousands of students  faculty members  and staff.Early yearsBorn in 1918 in Brooklyn  N.Y.  Eisen developed a keen interest in science at an early age  when a high-school chemistry class helped frame his perception of the world as a collection of atoms and molecules. Eisen began premedical studies at New York University in 1934  but halfway through his undergraduate career he needed to leave school — and his position as first baseman on NYU’s baseball team — after developing tuberculosis. Though Eisen’s TB kept him out of school for one year  the illness sparked a curiosity about the immune system that would endure for the rest of his life.Eisen returned to NYU to complete his bachelor’s degree  and he then enrolled at the university's medical school. He graduated with an MD in 1943 and then worked as an assistant in the pathology department at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons before going back to NYU for his residency.Eisen had a strong interest in basic science research  particularly in trying to better understand the body’s immune system. Though career options for physician-scientists had historically been limited  the federal government began to increase its funding of biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) following World War II. Seizing these new opportunities  Eisen became one of the first recipients of an NIH fellowship  which supported his research on sulfonamide-induced antibodies at NYU. These investigations helped him and colleague Fred Karush to determine the number of antigen-binding sites on antibodies.After his two-year NIH fellowship  Eisen worked briefly at the Sloan Kettering Institute before returning once again to NYU as a faculty member. Inspired by the work of his recently deceased role model  physician-scientist Karl Landsteiner  he studied immune reactions of the skin. In doing so  he clarified the basis for certain allergic responses and showed that only those chemicals capable of forming covalent bonds to skin proteins could cause a characteristic itchy rash.In 1955  Washington University in St. Louis recruited Eisen to join the faculty of its School of Medicine. There  he served as dermatologist-in-chief for five years before moving to the Department of Microbiology to serve as chair. While at WUSTL  Eisen published groundbreaking research in which he described affinity maturation: the process by which activated B cells produce antibodies with an increasingly higher affinity for invading pathogens after infection. This process is fundamental to the development of potent immune responses.“Our understanding of affinity maturation begins with Herman’s papers ” says Arup K. Chakraborty  director of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Robert T. Haslam Professor in Chemical Engineering  Physics  Chemistry  and Biological Engineering. “Understanding this evolutionary process is critical for vaccine design  and affinity maturation is also mimicked in countless academic laboratories and companies to design antibody-based therapies.”Joining the MIT cancer research communityIn response to the signing of the National Cancer Act of 1971  MIT tasked Nobel Prize-winning biology professor Salvador Luria with establishing and leading a new MIT Center for Cancer Research. Wanting to include cancer immunology as a focus of this new center  Luria approached Eisen about joining as a founding faculty member. Eisen accepted the role  and arrived at MIT in 1973 as a professor in the Department of Biology.Eisen brought his immunology expertise to MIT’s new cancer center to study how cancer cells evade the body’s natural immune response. Much of his work focused on studying myeloma tumors in mice and screening their associated proteins. He found that if he used myeloma proteins from one mouse to immunize other mice from the same strain  they were resistant when challenged with cancer cells.Eisen and his laboratory went on to study how CD8 T cells develop into cytotoxic  or “killer ” T cells and long-lived memory T cells. Therapeutic vaccines that exploit CD8 responses have not yet been developed for human populations; existing immunotherapies rely on helper T cells and other immune cells  and they do not mount the same aggressive offense against targets. Eisen was working to understand and overcome the barriers to creating effective CD8 vaccines  and his research on the subject was of particular importance to the advancement of cancer immunology. As part of this research  Eisen collaborated closely with Koch Institute faculty members Jianzhu Chen and Richard Young  who is also a member of the Whitehead Institute.“Herman's lifelong pursuit of science  even to the very last day of his life  has been an inspiration to many of us ” says Chen  the Ivan R. Cottrell Professor of Immunology. “He was a great human being with a great attitude and a clear mind. He will be missed greatly.”As a fixture of MIT’s cancer research community since its formal inception  Eisen could  in recent years  often be found in his second-floor Koch Institute office consulting with students and younger investigators.“Herman was a true treasure: an inspiring colleague  a caring mentor  and a wonderful human being ” says Tyler Jacks  director of the Koch Institute and the David H. Koch Professor of Biology. “We all aspire to be Herman Eisen.”Other colleagues remember Eisen not only as a groundbreaking immunologist  but also as a hardworking collaborator and a generous man of integrity. He continued to be an active scientist and had been working with Chakraborty on a paper until his passing.“Herman was a giant in the field of immunology  with many seminal discoveries ” Chakraborty says. “He was also the kindest and most generous and moral person I have known. Until the end  he was working on scientific problems with junior colleagues and students who benefited from his wisdom. I am lucky to have worked with this great scientist and wonderful human being.”“Herman was a wonderful colleague and a terrific person with the highest integrity — a true mensch ” adds Alan Grossman  the Praecis Professor of Biology and head of MIT's biology department. “We will miss his wisdom  thoughtfulness  and vitality.”Eisen was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965  the National Academy of Sciences in 1969  and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in 1974. He received numerous other awards and honors throughout his career  including the Behring-Heidelberger Award from the American Association of Immunologists  an Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Cancer Institute  and the Lifetime Service Award from the American Association of Immunologists  of which he served as president from 1968 to 1969.Eisen is survived by his wife Natalie; their children  Ellen  Jane  Jim  Tom  and Matthew; and 12 grandchildren.
Danielle Guichard-Ashbrook dies at 60,Danielle Guichard-Ashbrook  associate dean for international students and director of MIT’s International Students Office (ISO)  passed away Wednesday at her home in Newton  Mass.  surrounded by family. She was 60.Her death wasannouncedby her husband’s employer  radio station WBUR  which said the cause was cancer.An immigrant of French and German descent  Guichard-Ashbrook received her BA in 1977 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and married her high-school sweetheart  Tom Ashbrook  now the host of the nationally syndicated NPR program “On Point.” She received a master's degree in education from Harvard University in 1982. Her early career included positions as an academic coordinator for a Japan-based U.S. educational company  and as a program supervisor for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Guichard-Ashbrook joined MIT in 1988 as a staff assistant for international students in the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Education  and was promoted to staff associate in 1990 and to assistant dean in Student Assistance Services in 1993. In 1995  the organization moved under the oversight of the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education and was renamed as the International Students Office. In 2000  Guichard-Ashbrook was appointed interim director of the ISO; she was named director and associate dean for international students in 2001.“Danielle was a dear colleague  as well as a nationally recognized expert in international student issues and global education ” says Christine Ortiz  MIT’s dean for graduate education. “She led one of the most complex and critically important organizations at the Institute with grace  passion  excellence  dedication  and warmth — her contributions to our students  to our office  and to MIT were immense. Danielle was a steadfast champion for the well-being of our students  and continually strived to create a welcoming and inclusive climate for all. She was a cherished member of our team  and of our community  and we will miss her greatly.”Robert Randolph  now chaplain to the Institute  worked with Guichard-Ashbrook throughout her time at MIT. He praises her as “extremely knowledgeable in her area of expertise. She and Tom had travelled widely before they settled here in Boston  and she had good instincts about what it meant to be a stranger in a strange land.”As ISO director  Guichard-Ashbrook oversaw an extensive array of services associated with maintaining the legal immigration status of all of MIT’s international students  their dependents  and the approximately 650 international alumni each year who have recently graduated and are working in the United States on work authorization.She led the ISO through a period of extraordinary change: Not only did the Institute’s international student population nearly double during her tenure  but after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11  2001  the scale and complexity of immigration regulations in the United States increased dramatically. The ISO now interfaces with three times as many government agencies as it did when Guichard-Ashbrook became its director; reporting requirements have increased greatly; and the Institute’s students travel internationally more often.“She was able to hold steady in changing times while keeping up with what students needed ” Randolph says. “Never drawing attention to herself  she served her students and MIT with grace and wisdom.”Personal support became a focus of the ISO under Guichard-Ashbrook’s leadership. In 2013  the entire ISO staff was selected as a team recipient of an MIT Infinite Mile Award  having “continuously shown above-and-beyond dedication  expertise  commitment  effort  and excellence in their support and service to MIT students ” Ortiz said at the time.ISO advisors note that many conversations initiated to address practical arrangements naturally grow to include other happenings in a student’s life. ISO staff members always make themselves available to provide caring and specialized support  advising  and mentoring to international students  as Guichard-Ashbrook had been doing since 1988.Over the decades  as the immigration landscape changed  Guichard-Ashbrook shared her own knowledge and expertise as a regular presenter at regional gatherings of the Association of International Educators. The organization awarded her a Distinguished Service Award in 1997 for regularly bringing together the Boston-area community of international educators. In recent years  she had also served as a member of the Government Regulatory Advisory Committee  offering critical feedback and logistical advice as new regulations and policies were distributed from government agencies. Her advice shaped the way policy is executed not only at MIT  but at universities across the country.Guichard-Ashbrook is survived by her husband  Tom Ashbrook  of Newton; her children  Dylan Ashbrook of San Francisco  Benjamin Ashbrook of Los Angeles  and Lauren Ashbrook of New Haven  Conn.; and her granddaughter  Evie Ashbrook. The daughter of Robert and Barbara Guichard  she is also survived by her sisters  Elisabeth Hiltabrand  Peg Watters  and Natalie Milby.A memorial service will be held Saturday  Nov. 15  at 2 p.m. at Wilson Chapel on the campus of Andover Newton Theological School in Newton Centre  Mass. Gifts may be made in Guichard-Ashbrook's memory to support thePediatric Activity Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

"Car Talk" host Tom Magliozzi ’58 left us laughing,In the MIT Online Alumni Directory  Tom Magliozzi ’58 listed his job title as "Big Kahuna at Dewey Cheetham & Howe " the fictional Harvard Square law firm that fronted his long-running radio show "Car Talk " co-hosted with brother Ray Magliozzi ‘73. Although reruns will continue to keep us laughing  Tom died on Nov. 3 from complications of Alzheimer’s disease.At the 1999 MIT Commencement  Tom Magliozzi shared his research that he claimed provided evidence that “being unencumbered by the thought process” leads to greater happiness."Car Talk" made him a household name  at least to National Public Radio fans  for his self-deprecating humor  his delight in bantering with his brother  and the insights they dug out of callers who plied the brothers with automotive quandries. The conversations may have begun with a rattle in a beloved vintage car or advice from a caller about to move to Alaska with a convertible  but quickly moved to relationships  family negotiations  and quips. Who can forget the quips  “Life is too short to own a German car” or “Don’t drive like my brother”?Aside from his radio persona  however  Tom Magliozzi was highly accomplished. Born in East Cambridge  Mass.  he earned his MIT degree in economics  politics  and engineering  an MBA from Northeastern University  and  later  a PhD in marketing from Boston University. He famously quit a regular job after a near catastrophic car accident  and worked odd jobs and taught until he and his brother founded a do-it-yourself auto repair shop in 1973. After they were on an NPR panel of automotive experts in 1977  they converted the do-it-yourself shop into the Good News Garage and soon began their own radio show. Tom continued consulting and teaching during much of the 25-year "Car Talk" run. Live programming for the Peabody award-winning program ended in 2012.In 1999 — a year after President Bill Clinton and AIDS researcher David Ho were featured MIT Commencement speakers — the brothers took the podium in Killian Court. Perhaps you’d think this would be their serious moment? Not so much. Promising to share research of groundbreaking importance  Magliozzi asked President Charles M. Vest and brother Ray to hold a large slide that showed the direct relationship between using the right brain and greater happiness.“It’s almost a plot of intelligence vs. happiness  and the news ain’t good for you ” he noted.Magliozzi offered the students a pathway to nirvana by repeating the mantra — emblazoned on a “Car Talk” flag —“on impediti ratione cogitatoni” or “unencumbered by the thought process.” Magliozzi explained: “If you repeat this mantra  everything slows down. Life slows down. Being unencumbered by the thought process allows you to identify and hear and see defining moments in your life  things that will change your life…”And  of course  he did change his life and enriched many others with laughter.

Phoebe died peacefully.She leaves her parents  Andrew and Yingmei  three grandparents  and two aunts.Phoebe was born in Lafayette  Ind.  on Oct. 28  1995. She spent her early years living with her parents and grandmother in Indiana  Texas  and China  finally settling in Bethlehem  Pa. After completing middle school  Phoebe moved to Wayne  Pa.  with her family  graduating in 2013 from Conestoga High School with the All-School Scholar Award and the Rochester Institute of Technology Innovation and Creativity Award. In fall 2013  Phoebe started her undergraduate studies at MIT.Known for her sense of humor and curiosity  Phoebe is remembered for her quick wit and deep desire to explore.When she was young  Phoebe owned several sets of Barbie dolls. She would take off their clothes to trim  sew  and tape each piece into some new “style.” She would then repeat this process again later to create more designs after disassembling and mismatching her dolls. There was a running joke in the family that the Wangs had a “Phoebe Doll” shop in the house.A longtime lover of nature  Phoebe enjoyed exploring the woods in her neighborhood. She traveled extensively around the country  visiting many national parks and landmarks. Phoebe also loved to hike local trails.One time  Phoebe told her mother that she was going for a short walk outside; several hours later  she had still not returned. Her mom finally reached her via cell phone. It turned out that she decided to check out all of the Valley Forge National Park trails in one hike that day.During her exploration of the outdoors  Phoebe collected many relics  including rocks  old coins  and pieces of stained glass. They are now part of her bedroom decor  along with her origami — another passion of Phoebe’s.When Phoebe received news of her admission to MIT  she was so excited  and counted down the days to her freshman orientation. In her first year  she completed her math and science GIRs  and started taking advanced math and science courses to explore possible majors.Even with her full class schedule  Phoebe managed to fit in a campus job at the Music Library  and joined the MIT Symphony Orchestra to play her beloved flute. Music  especially classical music  was always part of her life. Whenever she was in a car with her parents or friends  Phoebe would often ask to turn on the radio and listen to classic music. She downloaded many pieces of music on iTunes or from the web  which she enjoyed while tackling her schoolwork or doing her chores. Moments of joy and elation would follow: “Oh yes  I played this piece before ” or  “Wow  I’ve got to find this music score and play it myself someday.”Phoebe liked to say  “It’s almost done  but never complete until it’s due.” She packed a lot of living into her short life.
Alumnus dies while attending campus leadership event,John Acevedo '67  a retired engineer with a long history of volunteering for the Institute  suffered a medical emergency during an Alumni Leadership Conference session on Sept. 20. Although MIT Police and emergency medical teams responded quickly and he was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital  Acevedo did not survive.Born in Puerto Rico  Acevedo studied physics at MIT and worked for Northrop Grumman for 38 years until his retirement in 2006. He had also worked independently as an information technology consultant since 1985. He traveled frequently from his home in the Baltimore area to Puerto Rico and recently attended his high school reunion there. Funeral arrangements are under way for his burial on his native island.“John was a true alumni leader  always bubbling with new ideas and ways to reach out to our classmates ” said Bob Ferrara ’67  president of their class. Acevedo was an organizer of the Tech Challenge Games  a feature of Tech Reunions  and for 23 years he helped run the games  often alongside his son  Patrick. He was vice president of the Class of 1967 and served as the class agent for the William Barton Rogers Society. He served as an educational counselor for many years.“John Acevedo was utterly devoted to our class and to MIT. He will be greatly missed " said John Ross  Class of 1967 vice president.Acevedo earned a master's in physics in 1974 at the University of Maryland at College Park. He was a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and served as webmaster of its Baltimore chapter.
Catherine “Kay” Stratton  wife of MIT’s 11th president  dies at 100,Catherine N. “Kay” Stratton — the wife of former MIT PresidentJulius A. Stratton  and for decades a great friend of the arts at MIT — died Sept. 10 at her beloved farm in South Newfane  Vt. She was 100 years old.Born in Los Angeles  Stratton was brought up in Charlottesville  Va.  and attended the University of Virginia’s Mary Washington College before enrolling in Wellesley College after her marriage in 1935.Long after serving  from 1959 to 1966  as the wife of MIT’s 11th president  Stratton made extensive contributions to the Institute  enriching the lives of students and faculty through her dedication to the arts and her commitment to a more vibrant campus.“Kay never stopped imagining ways that MIT might become a better place ” says Lawrence S. Bacow  president emeritus of Tufts University  who served as MIT’s chancellor from 1998 to 2001. “I first met her shortly after I became chancellor  when she came to talk to me about creating senior housing for MIT’s retirees. Later she enlisted me as a participant in the lecture series that she organized annually: Kay assembled leading experts from the Institute and beyond to focus attention on major issues of the day. Kay was a gem: the youngest  liveliest centenarian I have ever known.”Stratton co-founded the MIT Arts Committee in 1960 to foster the creative and performing arts at MIT  and to “bring to MIT a new emphasis on art as a necessary counterbalance to technology.” The Arts Committee’s recommended policy  still in place today  designates that 1 percent of every construction budget at MIT be designated for art for that building.The Arts Committee was later expanded into theCouncil for the Arts at MIT; during Stratton’s tenure as its co-chair  MIT’s permanent collection acquired works by prominent artists such as Henry Moore  Alexander Calder  Pablo Picasso  Louise Nevelson  Robert Motherwell  and Andy Warhol. Today  MIT students may borrow artworks annually through theCatherine N. Stratton Collection of Graphic Artsto enliven and enrich their dormitory rooms and living areas.“I have been with the Council for the Arts at MIT in one role or another since 1990  and one of the greatest parts of a great job has been the honor and privilege of calling Kay Stratton a friend ” says Susan Cohen  director of the Council for the Arts at MIT. “I remember when I first started  and I was addressing her as ‘Mrs. Stratton ’ she turned to me and said  ‘Please call me Kay  all my friends do.’ I felt like I had been ushered into a sort of charmed world. She was so much fun to be around  and such a positive force. She was what we all should aspire to be: honest  graceful  gracious  and a little mischievous.”Stratton’s vision  energy  and wide-ranging interests spurred others to activity within the MIT community. “It would never occur to me to just sit and rock ” she once said. “I adore putting ideas and people together.”In 1988  Stratton created the “Aging Successfully” lecture series at MIT to explore health topics of concern especially — but not exclusively — to an aging population. MIT created a Lecture on Critical Issues series in her honor in 1994  which has included such varied topics as Internet security  population growth  control of nuclear weapons  and microfinance.While living in New York when her husband was chairman of the Ford Foundation from 1966 to 1971  Stratton served on the board of the Bank Street College of Education. New York Mayor John V. Lindsay named her chair of the Visual Arts Committee of the New York City Cultural Alliance. She was a member of the boards of both the national and world YWCA  and was named Volunteer of the Year by the Cambridge YWCA in 1981. Stratton was also a longtime trustee and board chair of Lesley University  from which she received an honorary doctorate in 2004.While these activities consumed Stratton’s energies and excited her intellect  her family says that her heart lay in South Newfane  Vt.  where she and her husband (who died in 1994) bought “Toby Hill ” the family’s summer home  in 1941.“It is here that Kay exercised her gardening genius  created the ‘jam lab ’ and brought together frequent and joyous gatherings of family and friends ” says her daughter  Cary S. Boyd.At Kay Stratton’s 80th birthday celebration at MIT  another daughter  Cay Stratton  regaled the audience with Vermont tales of her mother teaching blackjack and poker to the young sisters “to sharpen our computational skills; efficiently dispatching garden-stalking woodchucks with a .22 rifle; and avidly engaging in sport with family and guests — no one is spared the vicious slash of her ping-pong forehand or the merciless drive of her croquet mallet.”Stratton is survived by three daughters: Cay Stratton  who lives in Chapel Hill  N.C.  with her partner  Barry Popkin; Cary S. Boyd  of Newbury  Mass.  and husband Lew Boyd; and Laura S. Thoresby  of Kent  England  and husband Jerry Blanchet. She is also survived by a granddaughter  Caroline Boyd Kronley; her husband  Neal Kronley; and a great-granddaughter  Sarah Finch Kronley  all of Brooklyn  N.Y.Memorial contributions may be sent to theCouncil for the Arts at MITorGrace Cottage Hospitalin Townshend  Vt. An MIT memorial service will be held Monday  Oct. 27  at 4 p.m.  in Wong Auditorium (E51-115).

John Waugh  Institute Professor emeritus  dies at 85,John S. Waugh  an MIT Institute Professor emeritus and professor emeritus in the Department of Chemistry  died Friday  Aug. 22  at the age of 85. Waugh was an authority in chemical physics  known internationally for his work in magnetic resonance.Waugh’s pioneering work in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) made it possible to study the molecular structures of proteins involved in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases  diabetes  and many other disorders. NMR uses the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to unravel the structures and dynamics of substances containing those nuclei. In NMR  the magnetic moments of atomic nuclei are stimulated with static and radiofrequency magnetic fields  and give rise to signals useful in a variety of applications — from medical imaging to spectroscopy.“He was an extremely humble giant in the development of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ” says Sylvia Ceyer  head of MIT’s Department of Chemistry. “His keen wit  razor-sharp intellect  and extraordinary sense of humor made him a treasured jewel amongst his colleagues.”Born in Willimantic  Conn.  in 1929  Waugh received his bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College in 1949  graduating summa cum laude with highest distinction in chemistry. He received his PhD in chemistry and physics from Caltech in 1953. He came to MIT as an instructor in chemistry that same year  and became assistant professor in 1955  associate professor in 1958  professor in 1962  and the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry in 1973.As a grad student in the lab of Caltech chemistry professor Don Yost  Waugh built his first NMR system with a borrowed magnet and some World War II surplus electronics. When he arrived at MIT  NMR was already a valuable tool for the study of molecular structure — but only for liquid samples.In the 1960s Waugh developed a way to use NMR to study solids by applying a special sequence of sharp  intense pulses of radiofrequency power. This made NMR useful for analyzing things that don’t dissolve in water  including proteins  nucleic acids (such as DNA)  and some drugs. That technique eventually played a role in many of the past half-century’s discoveries in chemistry  physics  biology  and materials science; it is now one of science’s most widely used tools."He basically invented the field of solid-state NMR when everyone else had left the field because they thought it was never going to work " says Robert Griffin  an MIT professor of chemistry who was a postdoc in Waugh's lab in the 1970s. "He made some incredible innovations that have led to many important scientific steps forward  and today solid-state NMR is a vibrant enterprise. There's a huge number of people working in it  and it's all because of things that happened in John Waugh's lab."In 2011  Waugh toldMIT Newsthat he never anticipated the wide impact his work has turned out to have.“I think that’s the way most [scientists] are ” he said. “You start off doing some limited kind of stuff that makes use of any particular talents or knowledge you happen to have. You don’t think of it as being something that’s going to revolutionize the world. It’s just something interesting to do  and might be fun.”In 1988  Waugh was the recipient of MIT’s James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award — an honor bestowed by faculty colleagues in recognition of extraordinary professional accomplishments and service to the Institute. In 2011  he received the Welch Award  given for basic research that benefits humankind.“Dr. Waugh discovered how to use NMR to study solids  creating a collection of tools that allows researchers to view the structures and properties of proteins  membranes  viruses and many other critical components of life ” said Ernest H. Cockrell  chair of the Welch Foundation  in presenting Waugh the award. “Ultimately  new applications in fields as diverse as medicine and batteries can trace their way back to the research techniques he initiated.”Waugh also won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1983. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and a former chairman of the Division of Chemical Physics of the American Physical Society. He received Dartmouth’s Haseltine Chemistry Prize in 1949  the Humboldt-Preis in 1972  the Irving Langmuir Chemical Physics Award in 1976  the Pittsburgh Spectroscopy Award in 1978  and Caltech’s Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1987. In 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth.Waugh is survived by his wife  Susan  of Lincoln  Mass.; a daughter  Alice  of Lincoln  Mass.; a son  Frederick  of Austin  Texas; and five grandchildren  Sarah and Rebecca of Lincoln  Mass.  and Jack  Ted  and Sam of Austin  Texas.The News Office will update this story as more information becomes available.
Otto Piene  leading figure in kinetic and technology-based art  dies at 86,Otto Piene  a professor emeritus of visual design who was the first fellow of MIT’s Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) and its director from 1974 to 1994  died on Thursday in Berlin. He was 86.Piene was born in Bad Laasphe  Germany  in 1928 and studied art in Munich and Dusseldorf; he also earned a degree in philosophy at Cologne University. He joined MIT in 1968 at the invitation of CAVS founder György Kepes  becoming a professor of environmental art in 1972 and succeeding Kepes as CAVS director in 1974.Piene exhibited widely over the course of his career  including multiple times at Documenta and the Venice Biennale. He was recognized with awards including the UNESCO Joan Miró Medal and the Sculpture Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Letters  as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland at Baltimore County.His practice  primarily sculptural  focused on public and participatory art connected to nature and the elements through technology. Varying in scale from 1972’s 600- meter “Olympic Rainbow ” which illuminated the sky over the Olympic Park at that year’s Munich Olympics  to gallery-scale projections  glittering kinetic sculptures  and small smoke paintings  his work concentrated particularly in the media of light  air  fire  and motion  exploring perception and the composition of spaces ranging from small studios to city skylines.Piene founded the influential European postwar movement Group Zero with his colleague Heinz Mack in 1957; joined later by Günther Uecker  the collective left a lasting imprint before it dissolved in 1966  spawning ZERO  an international network of artists who sought to transform and redefine art after World War II.Piene then pioneered the genre of “Sky Art” with his inflatables  organizing four conferences on the subject between 1981 and 1986 in the United States and Europe. As part of MIT’s 150th anniversary celebration  in 2011  he developed spectacular  glowing  inflatable stars-on-stalks that rose up into the night sky from Killian Court during theFestival of Art  Science  and Technology.Piene’s primary collaborators at MIT included electrical engineer Harold Edgerton  famous for his research on stroboscopic photography  and physicist Walter Lewin  an art enthusiast who specializes in X-ray astronomy.Piene is survived by his wife  Elizabeth Goldring  and four children.
JoAnn Carmin  expert on cities and climate change  dies at age 56,JoAnn Carmin  an associate professor of environmental policy and planning at MIT  died on Tuesday after an extended illness. She was 56 years old.Carmin had been on the faculty of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning since 2003. Her work broke new ground in examining the relationship between environmental problems and governmental actions. In particular  over the last decade Carmin studied the process through which cities around the world were responding to climate change.Carmin’s research relied on intensive fieldwork in cities  and on pioneering global surveys about the responses of urban leaders. She conducted extensive research on urban planning for climate change in Durban  South Africa  and Quito  Ecuador  among other places  describing in detail how local officials either found effective new ways of pushing climate planning forward  or ran into significant challenges.Carmin’s work showed that many of the metropolises with the most advanced planning for climate change were not in the wealthiest parts of the world  but rather were in regions that were already subject to extreme weather events  or had experienced resource problems tied to climate. This trend was also evident in the quantitative surveys she helped launch.Carmin also looked closely at the relationships among local  state  and national governments  uncovering the sometimes-fraught circumstances in which urban leaders attempted to gain support for climate initiatives from the other levels of government. Leaders in many cities  Carmin toldMIT Newsin 2012  “feel that national governments don’t understand the challenges they face.”Carmin was also direct and outspoken on the significance of climate change and the uneven progress communities and countries were making in dealing with it. “The issue is really critical ” she toldMIT Newsin 2012  adding that for cities actively confronting climate problems  “Just being able to initiate a program is a big first step  but sustaining it is a huge challenge.”Carmin co-edited four books on politics and environmental issues; she also wrote or co-authored more than two dozen journal articles  as well as more than a dozen book chapters or published reports. She gave talks and conference presentations at a wide variety of institutions on five continents  addressing audiences at universities and at organizations such as the World Bank.Carmin also served as a lead author for a chapter of the U.S. National Climate Assessment  and for part of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  published in 2013.“JoAnn was a friend and a close colleague ” said Eran Ben-Joseph  head of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “JoAnn quickly established herself as one of the world’s leading environmental sociologists. Her work on the role of social movements and institutions in shaping climate change policies has helped define climate-adaptation planning in cities across the world. She will be sorely missed.”Carmin received her BS in 1990 from Cornell University  studying management and organizational behavior. She obtained an MS in management and organizational theory from Cornell in 1993  and received her PhD in 1999 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  in environmental policy and planning. Her dissertation was on environmental politics in the Czech Republic.Before joining MIT in 2003  Carmin was an assistant professor at Virginia Tech and a visiting scholar at Duke University. At MIT  she was promoted to associate professor in 2006  and earned tenure in 2010.Carmin was an active and energetic teacher who created classes at MIT on subjects including environmental justice; disaster vulnerability and resilience; urban climate adaptation; and rebuilding New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. She served as a thesis advisor or reader for dozens of graduate students.Carmin is survived by her sister  Cheryl Carmin  a professor at Ohio State University  and was close to many friends and colleagues. Donations in her memory can be made to theJoAnn Carmin Memorial Fundat MIT or to theWorld Wildlife Fund.A liturgy and memorial service will be held on Thursday  July 17  at 7:00 p.m. at Shambhala Meditation Center of Boston  located at 646 Brookline St. in Brookline.
John King  professor emeritus of physics  dies at 88,Professor emeritus John G. King ’50  PhD ‘53  an experimental physicist  transformative physics educator  and leader of the MIT Molecular Beams Laboratory in the Research Laboratory for Electronics for 42 years  died on June 15 at his summer house in Wellfleet  Mass. A longtime resident of Cambridge  King was 88. The cause of death was congestive heart and renal failure.“John was an inspiring teacher and experimentalist. His educational passion was creating hands-on experiments built from ordinary parts you can find at any hardware store  what he lovingly called ‘mulch ’” said MIT senior lecturer in physics  and former King student  Peter Dourmashkin ’76 (physics)  ’78 (math)  PhD ‘84. “He was MITx before MITx.”King was born in London and educated in France  Switzerland  and the United States. He came to MIT as an undergraduate in 1943 and completed his undergraduate studies in physics following war service for the U.S. Army  U.S. Navy  and the Harvard Underwater Sound Lab. He joined the MIT physics faculty in 1953. King was named the Francis L. Friedman Professor of Physics in 1974 and retired from MIT in 1996.King was renowned for his null experiments — those designed to test fundamental principles. He helped develop the atomic clock and invented the molecular microscope. King’s best-known experiment  still found on the first page of most electricity and magnetism textbooks  is the measurement of the charge magnitude equality of the electron and the proton  and the neutrality of the neutron to a 10-20of an electron charge. King also conceived an imaginative experiment  prompted by cosmological ideas  to set a hard limit on the possibility that matter  over cosmological time  begets new matter  a version of what was once called the steady state cosmology.Building atomic and molecular beam researchProfessor of physics emeritus Rainer Weiss ’55  PhD ’62 was a colleague of King throughout his student and faculty years at MIT and considers him to be “one of the most creative and imaginative experimental physicists of his generation.” Both physicists were students of Jerrold Zacharias  who began the Molecular Beam Laboratory at MIT shortly after World War II. Molecular beam experiments measure the properties of individual atoms in a vacuum unperturbed by interactions with other molecules. The technique provides precise and universally reproducible values for the energy levels and other parameters of these quantized systems. King began his work in molecular beams by pioneering new methods to measure the charge and current distributions in the nuclei of the halogens. He discovered the magnetic octupole moment of the common isotope of iodine.During his years as director and principal investigator of the Molecular Beam Laboratory  King transformed the research conducted there. It branched into molecular beam techniques applied to collective body physics  cosmology  and biophysics. More than 100 undergraduate and 25 doctoral students obtained their degrees working on these topics during King’s tenure at the laboratory.At a 2000 gathering to celebrate King’s career  Fred Dylla ’71  SM ’71  PhD ’75 described working in the Molecular Beams Lab as “getting your hands dirty and being surrounded by brilliant students who were around all the time.” Dylla is currently executive director and CEO of the American Institute of Physics (AIP)  a nonprofit umbrella organization for 10 scientific societies that publishes scientific journals and provides information-based products and services.Applying atomic beam techniques to biophysics  King invented a molecular microscope using water molecules rather than light as the illuminating projectile. His idea was to map the locations where water would evaporate or stick on small biological samples such as cells with biologically interesting spatial resolution. Working models of the device were developed for some biology labs  though the technique has yet to be widely adopted.When inventions such as the molecular microscope were not as successful as he had hoped  King attributed the failure to insufficient effort in combining enough money and skilled personnel. Achieving this winning combination required  in his view  an attack on the problem with “ferocious vigor.” Moderate vigor was not enough.Reinventing physics educationDissatisfied with the lab exercises used in mid-century physics pedagogy  King worked tirelessly on innovative methods that stressed hands-on learning and independent thinking. In 1966  he initiated the Project Lab  in which students developed their own open-ended research projects. His belief that anyone could “find something interesting to study about any mundane effect” reflects the independent spirit of King’s own early and eclectic science education. He told his students that “the best way to understand your apparatus is to build it.”As an adviser  King quickly became a project participant. Charles H. Holbrow  professor of physics emeritus at Colgate University and currently a lecturer at MIT  recalled that King had “the wonderful gift of seeing physics in everyday phenomena and turning these into research projects.” Some 2 000 MIT undergraduates experienced Project Lab.Approached by a student seeking a thesis experiment or a colleague with an idea  King would  before long  be sketching ideas on the backs of envelopes  estimating orders of magnitude  and offering ideas on how to build and run the experiment.  Fred Dylla’s own undergraduate thesis with King was designed to determine the difference in charge between an electron and a proton. Still considered a highly sensitive measurement  the experiment utilized $20 worth of equipment.A King student from his MIT sophomore year through graduate school  Samuel A. Cohen  director of the Program in Plasma Science and Technology at Princeton University  learned how to operate a drill press and to build his own electron multipliers. At the same time  he was being influenced by King’s ideas. He says  “John’s mind kept jumping decades ahead  from atomic beams to superfluid He3to molecular microscopy — always decades ahead.”King believed that an understanding of fundamental science concepts should extend beyond physics course curricula. For years he championed the creation of a “Corridor Lab.” Never entirely realized at MIT (a couple of experiments now grace the Infinite Corridor)  Corridor Lab would have placed 100 experiments  each demonstrating a scientific principle  along the miles of MIT hallways. Anyone passing could interact with an apparatus; faculty members could send students to experiment with them; and other departments could participate. King envisioned similar modules in a wide range of venues to further public understanding of science.With other educators in the late 1950s and ‘60s  King worked on the revitalization of high school physics  following the startling realization on the part of Zacharias that “while students had taken physics  they didn’t understand anything.” When the 1957 launching of Sputnik spurred a nation-wide alarm and allocation of money to improve science teaching  King became deeply involved. In cooperation with the influential Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC)  he produced — and acted in —eight physics movies  including “Times and Clocks ” “Interference with Photons ” “Size of Atoms from an Atomic Beam Experiment ” and “Velocity of Atoms.” One of the films featured King demonstrating a principle of physics by driving one of the Bugatti automobiles he had meticulously restored down the Massachusetts Turnpike at high speed.A lengthy 2009 interview for the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics shows King’s ongoing interest in science as a basis for a healthy and rewarding intellectual life. Speculating on the significance of the earliest point on the educational spectrum  he proposed that each child at birth be equipped with a kit of simple tools (balls  funnels  etc.) designed to stimulate a life of joyful investigation. A more advanced set of gear would be universally furnished at age six.A life of inventionFamily  friends  and colleagues paint a portrait of an energetic  curious  and engaging man who applied these characteristics equally to his intellectual  professional  and personal lives. King’s wife  Jane Williams  recalls him as “interesting  imaginative  ingenious and lots of fun.” In addition to his enthusiasm for physics and the value of science as the basis for understanding the world around us  she says  he was throughout his life “passionate about classical music  poetry  and any kind of dictionary. Since his early years were spent in France  he cared about things French  including French wines.”King’s French stepfather introduced him to the tinkering that informed much of his approach to science  especially science teaching. As a high school student at Phillips Exeter Academy  he had his own laboratory. In life  as in science  he remained a relentless tinkerer  once rebuilding a bus  complete with bunks  to transport his large family to the farm in Woolwich  Maine  where he and his first wife  Elizabeth  lived for many years. She and several of their eight children still live in or around Woolwich.King was the recipient of many honors and awards for contributions to physics and physics education. These include the Alfred P. Sloan Award (1956)  the AAPT Robert Millikan Medal (1965)  the E. Harris Harbison Award (1971)  and the Oersted Medal (2000)  the most prestigious award of the American Association of Physics Teachers. His numerous publications include co-authorship with Paul Gluck of Jerusalem of “Physics Project Labs ” (Oxford University Press) to be published in fall 2014.In addition to his wife  King is survived by a daughter  Martha  and sons Andrew  James  Charles  David  Benjamin  and Matthew; granddaughters Sara  Katy  and Lily; stepchildren Cynthia  David  Catherine  and Nicholas; and eight stepgrandchildren. His oldest son Alan predeceased him.A memorial service will take place at MIT in October.
Professor Seth Teller dies at age 50,Seth Teller  a professor of computer science and engineering at MIT who was well known for his efforts to advance human-robot interactions  died yesterday. He was 50  and he had been a member of the MIT faculty since 1994.President L. Rafael Reif announced the news in an email to the MIT community.“I knew Seth as a person of great human warmth and intellectual intensity ” Reif wrote in his letter. “He was a brilliant engineer and a gifted advisor with a passion for new challenges. His loss is difficult to grasp.”Teller was a member of MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He led CSAIL’s Robotics  Vision  and Sensor Networks group  whose work aims to enable machines to become aware of their surroundings and interact naturally with people in health-care  military  civilian  and disaster-relief settings.“Seth’s outstanding contributions as a researcher  teacher  mentor  and colleague set a standard that has inspired many of us ” EECS Department Head Anantha Chandrakasan and CSAIL Director Daniela Rus wrote in a joint letter to their communities. “He had a unique ability to envision new approaches to problems  then assemble  motivate  and guide large research teams to accomplish things far beyond what they thought possible. As a colleague his reflexive openness and friendliness were a delight; he always seemed to have something new to talk about and he shared it in a way that drew you into the excitement that bubbled up from him.”The overarching theme of Teller’s research could be described as making robots that work with  for  and as extensions of people. His recent projects included wearable devices that provide information about nearby terrain  objects  text  and people to the visually impaired; a self-driving car; an unmanned  semiautonomous forklift; a robotic wheelchair operated by voice command; and a humanoid robot that performs dangerous tasks with limited human assistance.“Seth had so many talents — as a builder of novel systems  and a master of a broad range of disciplines including robotics  vision  graphics  and human-computer interfaces ” says colleague John Leonard  a professor of mechanical and ocean engineering. “He has left a profound legacy in robotics.”Success in robotics competitionsTeller led theMIT teamthat will compete in the final round of the prestigious DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC)  a competition sponsored by the Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to promote innovation in robotics technology for disaster response. The competition calls for a humanoid robot to perform a series of tasks related to a disaster-response scenario.Last December  the MIT team secured one of 11 prized spots in the final round of the DRC  currently slated for June 2015. The team participated in two rounds of competition  beating out more than 100 other teams  to secure a place in the finals. During the latest round of competition  the MIT team had to navigate a humanoid robot through a series of trials including walking  climbing  and handling tools and other objects.Teller had also led an MIT team that placed fourth in an earlier DARPA challenge  to develop an autonomous car. The finals in the autonomous-car competition took place in late 2007  and the following spring  Teller announced plans to develop an autonomous forklift  which his groupdemonstratedin 2010.From automobiles to forkliftsThe way in which Teller transitioned from automated cars to automated forklifts illustrated two of his abiding concerns: Beyond the technical feat of simply getting the forklift to do what it’s instructed to do  his team concentrated on making its movements predictable. The problem of robotic trajectory planning is enormously complicated; in the interest of efficiency  roboticists typically employ planning algorithms that  while easy to compute  yield jerky and counterintuitive movements.Because Teller was interested in robots that could blend seamlessly into human environments  his group also concentrated onplanning algorithmsthat would make their motions smoother and less obtrusive.The forklift also responded to speech  which took Teller’s team into an entirely different realm of computer science research: natural-language processing. In the abstract  natural-language processing is highly difficult  but it becomes exponentially easier when the range of possible interpretations can be constrained. Special-purpose robots’ limited repertoires of actions and prescribed contexts of operations offer just such constraints  and natural-language processing remained an interest of Teller’s group  yielding two new papers just this year.Technologies to assist those with disabilitiesTeller’s group also participated in the development of another autonomous  voice-controlled vehicle: a wheelchair that responded to spoken  rather than mechanical  commands. That project illustrated another of Teller’s longstanding interests: assistive technologies. Indeed  in 2012  together with his fellow EECS professor Rob Miller  Teller introduced MIT’s first undergraduate course on assistive technologies.In recent years  Teller’s research group turned its attention to developing assistive technologies for people with a variety of disabilities: self-driving wheelchairs for people with multiple sclerosis  Lou Gehrig’s disease  or brain or spinal cord injuries  as well as wearable machine-vision systems for blind and visually impaired people.As a leader of MIT’sFifth Sense Project  Teller worked with others to develop wearable devices for blind and low-vision people. These devices combine sensing  computation  and interaction to provide wearers with timely  task-relevant information about their surroundings — the kind of information that sighted people typically get without conscious effort.Last December  the Fifth Sense Project — and Teller — featured prominently in a visit to MIT by the famed Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli  whose foundation had awarded funding to the project. At the event  Teller described the goal of the project as “developing portable  wearable devices that [can] enable blind and visually impaired people to participate independently in daily activities. … We’re pursuing a multidisciplinary approach to solving these problems in the real world.”“Many of the ideas that were impossible decades ago are now possible ” Teller added  “but we’re trying to go from impossible to possible in principle  to practical and usable by real people  and finally to devices that are affordable. We’re early on the road to satisfying these requirements.”Sensors to protect peopleEven as Teller sought to make robots more humanlike  he also sought to abet human capacities with the types of sensor systems employed by robots. Another recent project aimed to develop a system to prevent injuries to police officers who  in the line of duty  frequently stop on the shoulders — or sometimes  when arriving at accident scenes  in the travel lanes — of busy roadways. The system works in two directions: In the first  a sensor system warns officers of approaching vehicles that are veering dangerously; in the second  a roof-mounted laser warns drivers of obstructions ahead  eliminating the need for officers to engage in the dangerous activity of setting out flares or cones in the roadway.In the 1990s  Teller pioneered 3-D mapping of large urban spaces with theCity Scanning Project  which created high-resolution 3-D models of parts of Cambridge using robot-mounted digital cameras and specialized algorithms to estimate the cameras’ positions and orientations. He also worked with his MIT colleagues to create the Cricket Indoor Location System  a network of radiofrequency and ultrasonic beacons that provided GPS-like position and attitude determination indoors.A native of Connecticut  Teller received his BA in physics from Wesleyan University  in 1985; his MS in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley  in 1990; and his PhD in computer science from Berkeley  in 1992. He held postdoctoral positions at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and at Princeton University before joining MIT as an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science in 1994. He was promoted to associate professor in 1998  received tenure in 2002  and became a full professor in 2007.Earlier this year  Teller was named the best undergraduate academic advisor by MIT’s IEEE/ACM Student Club. Over the course of his career  Teller received other honors including a Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation  in 1995  and naming by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation as a Sloan Research Fellow  in 1997.The author of more than 200 research papers  Teller won awards for the best paper or presentation at the International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multimedia (2001)  the Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (2004)  and CAAD 07 (2007).Gifts in Teller's memory may be made to theSeth Teller Memorial Fund  which will support research  education  and other innovations that advance and improve assistive technology for people with a range of disabilities.The Institute’s support services are available to all members of the MIT community and can be accessed viaMIT Together  or at 617-253-2916.

Irwin Oppenheim  professor emeritus of chemistry  dies at 84,MIT professor emeritus of chemistry Irwin Oppenheim  84  of Cambridge  passed away on June 3 from complications following cardiac surgery.Oppenheim carried out his undergraduate studies in chemistry and physics at Harvard University  graduating summa cum laude in 1949. He attended graduate school at the California Institute of Technology under John Gamble Kirkwood; when Kirkwood left for Yale University  Oppenheim followed him  completing his PhD in physical chemistry in 1956. His thesis research involved some of the first usage of the Wigner functions and expansion in powers of Planck’s constant to develop quantum corrections to classical distribution functions. These distribution functions were then exploited to deduce thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients.Oppenheim joined MIT's Department of Chemistry in 1961 as an associate professor — notably  its first theoretical chemist. He was promoted to full professor in 1965.Oppenheim’s research at MIT concentrated on a molecular description of relaxation phenomena in gases and liquids; he  his students  and collaborators made many important contributions to the field.“One important contribution is his explanation of the origin of the 'long time tails' unexpectedly observed in early molecular dynamics simulations of the correlation function of the viscosity of gases ” says Institute Professor emeritus John M. Deutch  who was Oppenheim’s second PhD student. “He improved our understanding of the microscopic basis of hydrodynamics  Brownian motion  light scattering  [and] magnetic resonance  and this work influenced thinking about these topics throughout the world. He was an expert on chemical thermodynamics and wrote two books on this subject.""With his passing  an important index [of] human civilization – 'global aggregate knowledge of chemical thermodynamics' — has declined 65 percent " Deutch adds. "Given all of Irwin’s contributions  I have thought for some time that his work has not received the recognition it should from the scientific community.”During his lifetime  Oppenheim published 247 publications. In 1996  he assumed emeritus status  but remained active in the Department of Chemistry until his death.Oppenheim was an excellent teacher  colleagues say  who taught decades of MIT undergraduate and graduate students introductory physical chemistry and statistical thermodynamics. He was an inspired PhD thesis and postdoctoral advisor to more than 50 individuals  many of whom went on to university positions across the world  and some at MIT. His warm mentoring ensured decades of devotion and friendship from his students.“Irwin was a master in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. His theory was marked by rigor and elegance  and has influenced a generation of theorists ” says professor of chemistry Jianshu Cao  who in teaching 5.72 (Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics)  would invite Oppenheim to present a week of lectures in exchange for a visit to a Chinese restaurant. “Irwin had a free choice of topics for the week  but always presented his version of Brownian dynamics theory. These lectures were delivered with precision and clarity  rarely seen in a classroom these days. Except for a few hardcore theory students  it was a challenge to follow his equations that covered the blackboard like wallpaper  but every student left in awe of this grand master and the classic style he exemplified.”David Chandler ’66  a former undergraduate student of Oppenheim’s who is now the Bruce Mahan Professor of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley  says  “Of all the wonderful teachers I learned from at MIT  Irwin Oppenheim influenced me the most. My textbook borrows from his pedagogical style  and my research career began on the road he paved for me. I owe much to him  and I will miss him greatly.”Throughout this career  Oppenheim collaborated with colleagues across the globe — notably from Japan  Israel  and the Netherlands. His Dutch coworkers — Nico van Kampen  Peter Mazur  Ubbo Felderhof  and Dick Bedeaux — often visited MIT  resulting in friendships and collaboration with many members of the department.“Irwin Oppenheim was an exceptional colleague and friend  an erudite master of the subtleties of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics ” says Jim Kinsey  who served as head of the Department of Chemistry from 1977 to 1982. “His originality and scholarship  along with his jovial enjoyment of good food  good drink  and good company  made him a magnet for outstanding visitors from all over the globe.”“It was always fun to stop by his office and have a moment of revelation ” Cao says  noting Oppenheim’s warm  fun-loving disposition. “Irwin had a high standard for science  but he would always express his opinion with a good sense of humor and a few loud laughs. After lunch  Irwin used to have an afternoon cigar  and sometimes asked me to join him. Though not a fan of cigars  I would happily listen to his jokes and wise comments. In recent years  he became less critical about science but still possessed a sharp mind and quick wit. I have fond memories of these light moments and will miss him dearly.”“Irwin was my 'academic grandfather ' and he treated me like family from the moment I walked in the door of MIT almost one year ago " says Adam Willard  an assistant professor of chemistry. "We talked frequently  sometimes about science — he was truly a master thermodynamicist — but quite often about all those important nonscientific aspects of life. He was a great listener  unusually wise  and had a fantastic sense of humor. His presence here will be sorely missed.”Irwin Oppenheim was born in Boston in 1929 to James and Rose (Rosenberg) Oppenheim. He was an only child  but grew up in the company of many aunts  uncles  and cousins. He married Bernice Buresh in 1974. In addition to his wife  he is survived by a son  Joshua Buresh-Oppenheim  a daughter-in-law  Rachel Schorr Hirsch  and a granddaughter  Rosalind Iona Hirsch Oppenheim.Oppenheim was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Physical Society  a member of the Washington Academy of Science  and the recipient of the American Chemical Society's Joel Henry Hildebrand Award.“Irwin was a positive part of my life  both professionally and personally  for 65 years " says Institute Professor emeritus John Waugh. "I loved and respected him. My world will be smaller  bereft of his wonderful spirit and bonhomie.”A memorial service will take place on Saturday  Nov. 1  at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge  Mass.

Tom Hughes: Remembering a non-lifer ,Thomas Hughes  a Distinguished Visiting Professor at MIT and Mellon Professor Emeritus of the History of Science at the University of Pennsylvania  passed away Feb. 3  2014 at age 89. Hughes  who pioneered the field of the history of technology  was also a founder of the Society for the History of Technology. Below is a reflection on his life and contributions by his MIT colleague Rosalind Williams  the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science and Technology.MIT is justifiably proud of its “lifers”: individuals who enter MIT as freshmen  continue here for graduate school  join the faculty  and live out their entire professional lives under the Great Dome. In some cases — Paul Gray and Sheila Widnall come to mind — the character of the individual becomes so intertwined with the character of the Institute that it becomes hard to know where one stops and the other begins.Thomas Parke Hughes (1923-2014) was a non-lifer. He came to MIT in the 1960s for a short stint as an assistant professor. He soon moved on to other institutions  where over time he developed into the nation’s pre-eminent historian of technology. When he returned to MIT as a Distinguished Visiting Professor in the 1990s and early 2000s  he brought with him a deep understanding of how the history of technology transforms our understanding of general history  as well as of the role and responsibilities of engineering.Would he have developed such perspectives if he had spent his whole career at MIT? This is an unanswerable question  but without question Tom Hughes reminds us of the invigorating role of non-lifers in our community.The nation's pre-eminent historian of technologyBorn and raised in Richmond  Va.  Thomas Parke Hughes served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before earning his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Virginia. He stayed there to get his doctorate in modern European history in 1953. Tom came to MIT in the mid-1960s  when the relatively new School of Humanities and Social Science was trying to figure out how to stock a faculty for an amorphous Course XXI. He was part of a cohort of 13 junior faculty; only one of them (Bruce Mazlish  in history) was ultimately tenured. Along with the rest  Tom departed MIT  first for a temporary appointment at Johns Hopkins University and then for a professorship at Southern Methodist University.At SMU  Tom published a biography of Elmer Sperry (1971)  still valuable reading for anyone interested in engineering control systems and their role in 20th-century history. Primarily on the strength of this acclaimed study  he was invited to become a professor in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He was 50 years old when he accepted the appointment  which elevated both him and the department to academic fame and glory. Graduate students applied to Penn to work with Tom  and the Philadelphia area became a magnet for historians of technology.Conceptualizing technological systems defining structures of modern lifeTom sealed his pre-eminence in the field with the 1983 publication of "Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society  1880-1930." This was more than a comparative history of electrification in the United States  Britain  and Germany: It was also a manifesto declaring the concept of technological systems  which reoriented the history of technology from a focus on the invention of devices to a focus on the construction of large complex systems. Because such systems are defining structures of modern life  this reorientation confirmed the history of technology as an element of general history.Tom began to write for broader audiences  most notably in "American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm  1870-1970" (1989)  which was a finalist for the 1990 Pulitzer Prize in history. Also in 1990  Tom returned to MIT as a visiting professor. He taught here for a semester and returned for shorter visits to help supervise graduate students and to run workshops on technological systems. The latter involved faculty from across the Institute  especially from the Program in Science  Technology  and Society and from the School of Engineering.An enduring affinity for MITAfter retiring from Penn in 1994  Tom was elevated to Distinguished Visiting Professor at MIT  and spent even more time here. In 1998  he was on campus for two months giving a series of lectures on "open technological systems " which he defined as ones exhibiting “a complex mix of technical  economic  political  social  and environmental factors.” His favorite example was the Central Artery and Tunnel (CAT  better known as Boston’s “Big Dig”)  with Fred Salvucci playing the role as chief system-builder. The CAT  along with the SAGE computer-based defense system and ARPANET  were featured in Tom’s book "Rescuing Prometheus" (1998)  an influential cluster of case studies of open technological systems.In a 2002 email to Philip Khoury (then dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences) requesting a renewal of his visiting appointment  Tom wrote: "I am so pleased to have the MIT appointment. For years  even decades  I have felt close to MIT  sharing its notable achievements and sensing its problems and opportunities."He went on to explain why he felt this closeness: "Over the years  I have tried to understand the character of the engineering profession and  in a limited way  broaden its horizons by helping it to see the central role and daunting responsibilities that it has in the modern world. Engineers lament that they are not appreciated. They do not need the appreciation of others so much as they need secure self-esteem. This would come  I believe  if they accepted the messy complexity and moral dimensions of their calling."Technology as a part of a broader human historyTom was already engaged with the problems and opportunities of engineering when I first met him in the mid-1960s  as a Radcliffe College senior serving him as a research assistant. I enjoyed visiting Tom to discuss my assignments  but the questions he asked me to research were sober and difficult. The imprint of World War II was pronounced. He was already studying the Manhattan Project as an engineering project  a topic he later wrote about in "American Genesis." He was also  with obvious emotional difficulty  trying to understand the mechanisms of slaughter used in the Holocaust. Many years later I heard him discuss in a seminar the concept of “technological sin” as something both historians and engineers need to contemplate  because the historical world is a sinful one.Like William Barton Rogers himself  Tom Hughes came to MIT from Virginia with a vision of what technology and engineering mean in the broad context of human experience. Providing scholarly grounding for that vision was a difficult problem — but Tom would quote Sperry to the effect that he chose the most difficult problems because doing this was a way to avoid vulgar competition.It took Tom many years in the academic wilderness to redefine technological systems and engineering practice as part of larger history. These views do not come naturally to MIT. We have too much invested in defining engineering as a specialized or semispecialized activity that brings order and moral clarity to the world. But engineering cannot assume “the central role and daunting responsibilities that it has in the modern world” unless we confront its messy complexities and moral ambiguities. They inevitably arise because engineering is inseparable from political  economic  social  and legal structures and activities. By reminding us of this broad historical perspective  Tom Hughes  MIT non-lifer  made an immeasurable contribution to the life of the Institute._________________________________________________________________________________Prepared by MIT SHASS CommunicationsCommunication and Design Director: Emily HiestandAssociate News Manager: Kathryn O'NeillCommunications Assistant: Kierstin Wesolowski
Morris Adelman  MIT economics faculty member for more than six decades  dies at 96  ,Morris Adelman  an MIT economics faculty member for more than six decades  passed away on May 8 at the age of 96.Adelman made important contributions in both industrial organization and energy economics. He was known for his landmark 1955 study of vertical integration  which described both the economic consequences of integration and the difficulty of measuring it  and for his 1959 analysis of the cost structure of the A&P supermarket chain  which argued that this pathbreaking national grocery chain achieved lower prices because of cost advantages over smaller rivals  not because of anticompetitive pricing.In the 1960s and 1970s  Adelman turned his attention to energy economics. His 1972 classic  "World Petroleum Markets " offered a careful analysis of the sustainability of cartel pricing by OPEC and an optimistic long-term outlook for competition in the global oil market.Adelman was an undergraduate at City College of New York  from which he graduated in 1938. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1948. He came to MIT in 1948 as part of the postwar expansion of the MIT Department of Economics  and remained affiliated with MIT for the next 65 years. After retiring  he remained actively involved with the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.
Senior research scientist emeritus Alan Lazarus dies at 82,Alan Jay Lazarus  senior research scientist emeritus at MIT  a gentle man  respectful of all and respected by all who knew him  died peacefully in his home in Lexington  Mass.  on March 13 of complications with Lewy body dementia and with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. He was 82.Lazarus was born in San Francisco on October 24  1931. His early education in California schools  completed with a year at Phillips Andover Academy  developed in him a love for learning  especially science. He had summer jobs at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Labs  while earning degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (SB 1953  in physics) and Stanford University (PhD 1958  in high-energy physics  under the direction of W. K. H. Panofsky). He did post-graduate work at the Rand Corporation.Lazarus’ career at MIT  begun in 1959  spanned more than 50 years. He joined space research pioneers Bruno Rossi and Herbert Bridge to study space physics  focusing particularly on space plasma and the solar wind. At MIT's Center for Space Research (now the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research)  Lazarus helped develop instruments for more than 20 spacecraft missions to learn about the solar wind  including the plasma instruments on board Voyagers 1 and 2  launched in 1977  which are the first spacecraft to travel beyond the edge of our solar system. Instruments he developed continue to provide measurements of the solar wind plasma that buffets Earth  and of the distant boundary between solar plasma and the interstellar medium.Lazarus was the principal investigator for a solar wind experiment on SOL-RAD 11. He was also a co-investigator for: a solar wind plasma experiment utilizing Faraday cup sensors on Explorers 10  18  33  and 35  which studied Earth’s magnetosphere; the Mariner 4  Mariner 5  and Mariner 10 missions to Venus and Mars; Pioneers 6 and 7 and Voyagers 1 and 2  which explored the outer solar system; the Imp-7  Imp-8  and Wind spacecraft focused on solar wind near Earth; the Orbiting Geophysical Observatories 1 and 3  which studied Earth’s magnetosphere; and the Giotto probe to Halley's comet. He was the lead or co-author on more than 200 scientific papers. Lazarus’ DSCOVR Faraday Cup is scheduled to fly in early 2015 as a real-time beacon for NOAA space weather forecasting. Because it will be sun-pointed and make fast measurements  this instrument will be a prototype for a Faraday Cup on Solar Probe  on which he was a co-investigator  and which is scheduled for launch in 2018.In addition to his research position  Lazarus was a senior lecturer in MIT's Department of Physics. He cared deeply about his students and worked to bring delight to their learning experiences  in the first- and second-year physics courses taken by all MIT students (8.01 and 8.02)  and by working to develop innovative teaching methods. He ran a modern laboratory course for physics majors that introduced students to techniques of classical and modern physics  and served as co-director of MIT's Integrated Studies Program. Always ready to share his experience and love of MIT  Lazarus was a caring and devoted faculty advisor to many students over the years. In 1963 he was the first recipient of MIT's Everett Moore Baker Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching. From 1977-1980 he was MIT's Associate Dean of Students in Charge of Freshman Advising  where he was instrumental in the creation of the Undergraduate Academic Support Office. In 1998 he received the Department of Physics' William W. Buechner Faculty Award for Teaching.Lazarus was a beloved colleague to his MIT compatriots  to the many graduate students and senior thesis students he mentored  and to the wider space physics community  nationally and internationally. “I really can't think of another person in our field who would so frequently bring a smile to people's faces as they remembered a time he helped them out  often as a student or post-doc just getting started  and often without asking or expecting anything in return ” says University of Michigan professor Justin Kasper  formerly of the Kavli Institute. “He really would help anyone who asked.”Lexington  Mass.  was Lazarus’ home for 42 years. He was an active member of the community  serving as an elected Town Meeting member for 30 years and on various town boards and committees  from Appropriations to Hanscom Field Advisory. He was chair of the group that founded LexMedia  the town television station. He was also deeply interested in the town schools  especially in their teaching of science  and he served on the school system's Science Advisory Council and as a judge for the high school's science fairs.Lazarus enjoyed swimming  sailing  and the rich atmosphere of MIT's collegial community. He loved music  art  and culture  good food and drink  and the company of friends and family. He is survived by his wife of 43 years  Marianne; his daughter  Julia  of Providence  R.I.; his sister and brother-in-law Louise and Pieter de Vries of San Rafael  Calif.; a nephew; three nieces; and their six children. He will be missed by his many friends and colleagues  who gathered in Lexington on April 12 in celebration of his life.To commemorate Lazarus’ dedication and devotion to advising and mentoring students  and to recognize him as a champion of faculty engagement with students  theAlan J. Lazarus (1953) Excellence in Advising Awardhas been established to be awarded annually to an MIT faculty member who has served as an excellent advisor and mentor to freshmen  and who has had a significant impact on their personal and academic success.  Those who wish to make a gift in support of this award may do so by contacting Bonny Kellermann '72  MIT Director of Memorial Gifts  atbonnyk@mit.eduor617-253-9722.
Family and friends recall graduate student Hadi Kasab,When Hadi Kasab was a boy in Lebanon  he went through a phase of carrying a small briefcase to school.“He already knew that he wanted to be an engineer ” Kasab’s younger sister  Jana  recalls — and the young Hadi thought that carrying a briefcase was something all engineers did.Her brother never lost his sense of wonderment at the world  Jana Kasab says: “He was really always a 5-year-old on the inside.”Hadi Kasab  23  was found dead in his room in MIT’s Sidney Pacific dormitory on the evening of March 6. He had been a second-year graduate student in MIT’s program in Computation for Design and Optimization  on track to graduate with his master’s degree in June.“He was very quiet most of the time ” Jana Kasab says. “We used to say that he lived in his own world.” At a kindergarten graduation ceremony  her distracted but driven brother marched straight across the stage  without even stopping to receive his certificate.He was also humble  Jana Kasab says: “My mother was once chatting with Hadi via Skype. She was telling him about people’s reactions when they found out that her son is in MIT. Hadi hated that. He didn’t like to gloat about it — but Mom  as a proud parent  did. So he promised Mom that he’d buy her an umbrella with the MIT logo on it  so that she’d stop telling people that her son is in MIT  and instead people would take the initiative to ask her.”‘Achieving goals  one after another’Born on Sept. 12  1990  Hadi Kasab was a native of Saida  Lebanon  a city of 80 000 on the Mediterranean Sea  about 25 miles south of Beirut. As a high school student  he was drawn to mathematics and physics  and developed an interest in the aerospace industry.Mohamad Mirhi  an MIT graduate student in mechanical engineering who also hails from Saida  was a year ahead of Kasab in school. The two became friends as undergraduates at American University of Beirut (AUB)  where Kasab studied mechanical engineering.“Saida is a relatively traditional city ” Mirhi says. “So Hadi grew up within a small community where expectations might be limited to getting a bachelor’s degree and a job later.”But  Mirhi says  his friend was not satisfied with that limited trajectory.“He took upon himself many challenges that made him very outstanding ” Mirhi says. “He was purposeful as he set a number of goals in his mind. He exerted great … effort to secure the top rank in the South Governorate of Lebanon in the Baccalaureate official exams  before getting admitted to the best college in Lebanon and the Middle East. He was achieving goals  one after another.”As an undergraduate at AUB  Mirhi says  Kasab carried a heavy course load  but still found time to contribute to others’ research projects. “In fact  he worked on my senior project as an undergraduate researcher ” Mirhi says  “and he significantly contributed to the work. He definitely made use of any opportunity to keep his learning curve steadily growing.”A love of challengesKasab’s program at AUB required him to complete an internship during the summer after his junior year. Inspired by some of his professors who were MIT alumni  Kasab aimed for the Institute.“His interest in MIT stemmed out from his love for challenge ” Mirhi says. “MIT seemed to be the most logical extension of his academic profile … that environment that is rigorous enough for hard-working students to excel  yet open enough for them to meet brilliant people with common interests.”Kasab secured the summer internship he sought  and came to MIT in the summer of 2011 as a visiting undergraduate research associate in the Uncertainty Quantification Lab within MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. While there  he developed simulations to investigate the wettability of transparent media.After returning to Beirut for his senior year at AUB — graduating in June 2012 with a near-perfect GPA — Kasab gained admission to MIT’s master’s program in Computation for Design and Optimization (CDO).A ‘brilliant mind at work’Kasab’s advisor at MIT was Zoltan Spakovszky  a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the director of MIT’s Gas Turbine Laboratory  where researchers work on power and propulsion systems and new aircraft designs to limit environmental impacts  as well as technologies to reduce aircraft noise.“I am very privileged and proud to have had the chance to do research with Hadi  to see his brilliant mind at work  and to experience the impact of his research ” Spakovszky says. “He was one of the smartest master’s students I have advised.”Within Spakovszky’s lab  Kasab’s work aimed to mitigate aircraft noise around airports  a major factor limiting the growth of commercial air transportation.“Hadi’s work focused on the development of a fast method for computing the acoustic shielding of engine noise by the airframe ” Spakovszky says. “The problem requires knowledge and skill in acoustics and applied mathematics  a perfect match for Hadi’s exceptional mathematical talent. Borrowing ideas from geometrical optics  Hadi developed and implemented new ways to capture the effects of acoustic diffraction and reflection.”Compared to current tools that take days to run on a supercomputer  Spakovszky says  the noise-assessment capability that Kasab helped develop runs in seconds on a laptop to optimize the configuration of unconventional aircraft — opening up new opportunities in aircraft design.“Hadi was very determined  always going all the way until a satisfactory solution was found ” Spakovszky says  adding: “Hadi was a very noble and humble person and had a hard time taking credit for his great achievements. He was extremely smart and had a very broad mind. You could talk to him about anything  including even literature. He was very sociable and witty. He always brought a warm atmosphere to the room.”While at MIT  Mirhi says  Kasab cultivated a love for the outdoors  especially hiking and rock-climbing. He developed a passion for cooking — in particular  steak — and regularly went to the gym. He loved “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart”; in January  the two friends traveled to New York to see a live taping of the show.“Hadi was a young man of great promise ” Mirhi says. “All who know him predicted a very bright future ahead. Everyone was waiting for Hadi’s next big thing. But he left early.”In addition to his sister  Jana  Hadi Kasab is survived by his parents  Saeb and Dalal Kasab  and a brother  Karim Kasab  all of Saida  Lebanon.
Patrick McGovern  founder of McGovern Institute for Brain Research  dies at 76,Patrick J. McGovern ’59  a longstanding MIT supporter who made the gift that launched MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research  died March 19 at the age of 76. As an MIT undergraduate  McGovern studied biophysics and later went on to found International Data Group (IDG)  a publisher of computer-related news  information  and research.In 2000  the McGovern Institute was established with a gift of $350 million from McGovern and his wife  Lore. In founding the McGovern Institute  Patrick and Lore McGovern dreamed of contributing to neuroscientists’ understanding of the human brain and the development of new treatments for neurological disorders.“Our hearts go out to Lore and the McGovern family for the loss of their beloved Pat ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. “The MIT community has lost an extraordinary friend  supporter  advisor  and inspiration — and the world has lost someone with a rare power to see the future and seize its opportunities. Just as Pat launched IDG almost before the computer industry existed  he and Lore grasped very early that brain research would be the next great scientific frontier. Their gift to launch the McGovern Institute provided practical support for fundamental brain science on a scale no one had imagined before; just as important  it played a key role in enabling MIT to build a broader community of brain researchers committed to unraveling and defeating the terrible disorders of the brain — Pat and Lore’s great dream. As we absorb the loss of Pat's friendship  we take consolation in his lasting gift to humankind.”“Pat and Lore McGovern inspired all of us with their passion to understand the brain and to help people suffering from brain disorders ” says Robert Desimone  director of the McGovern Institute and the Doris and Don Berkey Professor of Neuroscience. “Their gift enabled many new students and faculty to start research careers  and they personally cheered everyone on with each important discovery. Pat will be greatly missed.”Below is the text of a remembrance of McGovernoriginally published by the McGovern Institute.Patrick J. McGovern  1937–2014: a remembrancePatrick McGovern was born in 1937 in Queens  New York  and grew up in New York and Philadelphia. He became interested in the brain as a teenager  when he came across a book titled “Giant Brains  or Machines that Think” in the Philadelphia public library. As he recalled in an interview some 50 years later  “It was the first book that talked about computers and their role as an amplifier of the human mind ” and it sparked a lifelong interest in science and technology.In 1955 Pat was admitted to MIT  where he majored in biophysics. He studied neurophysiology and recalls using a glass electrode to study electrical activity in tadpoles. He also became involved in student newspapers  and after graduating from MIT in the Class of 1959  he was hired as an assistant editor for a new magazine  “Computers and Automation ” founded by Ed Berkeley  the author of the book that had so intrigued him 10 years earlier.After four years as a magazine editor  Pat left to found his own company  now known as International Data Group (IDG)  which under his leadership grew to become the world’s foremost publisher of computer-related news  information and research. IDG today is a multibillion-dollar business  with 2013 revenues of over $3.5 billion.The story of Pat’s career at IDG has been often told  and his business accomplishments have been recognized with many honors  including lifetime achievement awards from American Business Media and from the Magazine Publishers of America. Yet despite his success and his imposing physical presence  Pat retained a modest demeanor and never cultivated the trappings of great wealth. Instead  he focused his energies on leadership of the company (of which he remained chairman until the time of his death) and increasingly  in his later years  on his philanthropic priorities.His career and fortune were made in computer technology  but Pat never lost sight of his early dream to understand the brain  which he often described as the world’s most complex computer. When he studied neurophysiology at MIT in the 1950s  the tools were not adequate to the enormous challenge of understanding how the human brain works  but by the 1990s  technological progress had been so dramatic that the field had been transformed almost beyond recognition. A scientific understanding of the brain  while still a daunting challenge  was no longer within the realm of science fiction  but was a real prospect for the future.Pat’s dream was shared by his wife  Lore Harp McGovern  a Silicon Valley entrepreneur whose interests included health care  education and high tech. In the late 1990s  they decided that the time was right to establish a new institute for brain research  and after consultations with many leading scientists and universities  they decided that the new institute would be at MIT.Pat and Lore had both been longstanding MIT supporters; Pat was a member of the MIT Corporation  and Lore was chair of the Board of Associates at the affiliated Whitehead Institute. But they always emphasized that their choice of MIT was not simply a matter of loyalty to Pat’s alma mater. They felt that MIT was the right choice because of its alignment with their vision of a multidisciplinary  outward-looking institute that would engage the widest possible range of scientific talents in support of its mission to understand the brain.One goal was to understand the basis of brain disorders and to lay the foundation for new treatments for conditions such as psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases — a goal that Pat and Lore considered vitally important  given the enormous suffering and economic costs that are inflicted by these disorders. But their vision was not confined to disease research; they also understood the brain to be the source of our humanity  our creative achievements  and our conflicts  and they saw the possibility that understanding these things in scientific terms could transform the world for the better.The McGovern Institute for Brain Research was formally established in 2000  with a commitment of $350 million from Pat and Lore  one of the largest philanthropic gifts in the history of higher education. Nobel laureate and Institute Professor Phillip A. Sharp was named founding director; Robert Desimone succeeded Sharp as director in 2004. In the fall of 2005  the McGovern Institute moved into spacious facilities in MIT’s Brain and Cognitive Sciences Complex  one of the most distinctive landmarks on the MIT campus and among the largest neuroscience research buildings in the world.The McGovern Institute has continued to thrive since it moved to its new home  expanding in size and scope as it has hired new faculty and built new laboratories. Most importantly  it has produced a steady stream of discoveries about the working of the brain  in areas ranging from the genetic control of brain development to the neural basis of human thought and emotion. This progress was deeply gratifying to Pat and Lore  who visited regularly to attend the institute’s board meetings and scientific events  mingling with faculty and researchers and engaging deeply in discussions of their new findings.Throughout his life  Pat retained an extraordinary ability to absorb new information  and researchers were frequently impressed at his ability to cite detailed facts and figures about the brain. He was a tireless advocate for the institute and its mission  hosting many visits and tours  and inspiring others to follow his philanthropic example. He was  and Lore remains  an enormous source of inspiration and encouragement to the researchers at the institute.Throughout Pat’s business career  his vision was global  and he took great pride in the fact that IDG was one of the first Western companies to establish a business presence in China after the end of the Cultural Revolution. It is thus fitting that Pat and Lore’s philanthropic vision also extended to China; since 2011  three new IDG/McGovern Institutes have been established in Beijing  at Tsinghua University  Peking (“Beida”) University  and Beijing Normal University. Like the McGovern Institute at MIT  the new institutes in China are focused on fundamental research in neuroscience as well as translational work on disease applications.Pat always saw brain disorders as global problems that required global solutions  and one of his greatest hopes was that the new institutes would help accelerate the international cooperation that he saw as essential to the ultimate goal of understanding the human brain in health and disease.Pat’s wife  Lore  has been a full partner throughout the McGovern Institute’s 14-year history  serving on the governing board of the institute along with Pat and his daughter  Elizabeth McGovern. All of us at the institute offer our deepest condolences to Lore  to their four children  and to all of Pat’s family members and friends. He will be greatly missed.

Bruce Graber  Alumni Association IT expert  dies at 51,Bruce E. Graber II of Cambridge  a senior project manager at the MIT Alumni Association  died of complications from cancer on Feb. 22 at the age of 51.Graber  who grew up in Maine  is survived by his wife  Giulia (Gheorghiu) Graber; his parents  Michal and Ray Graber of Alfred  Maine; five brothers and sisters; and 13 nieces and nephews.In 1982  Graber joined the U.S. Navy  earning highest honors in the Naval Nuclear Training Unit and Engineering Laboratory School. During travels with the Navy aboard the nuclear submarine USS Trepang  including a trip to the North Pole  he was responsible for the engineering laboratory division’s performance of chemical analyses and radiological controls.In 1988  Graber’s nuclear expertise brought him to MIT  where he took a job as safety officer for MIT’s nuclear research reactor. In 2000  he joined the IT department for the MIT Alumni Association  where he managed the programming group responsible for generating reports from the alumni database of record. His most recent position was as ADVANCE senior project manager.“Bruce hit the ground running when he joined the team in 2000 ” says Joe Recchio  the Alumni Association’s director of information systems and services. “Besides his incredible work ethic  Bruce and I often shared our similar political views and love-for-animal stories at 6:00 a.m.  when we were the only two in the office. I  and many others  will truly miss him.”Graber earned a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences in 1997 at Northeastern University and continued his education as a master’s in liberal arts student at Harvard University  where he studied information technology.Reflecting his lengthy service to the Institute  Graber will be inducted posthumously as an honorary member of MIT’s Quarter Century Club. He was a member of the American Nuclear Society and the Health Physics Society  and he volunteered at the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Boston.Members of the MIT community are invited to attend a wake on Wednesday  Feb. 26  from 4 to 8 p.m.  at theKeefe Funeral Homeat 2175 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge. Donations in Graber’s memory may be made to theNorth American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.
Howard Brenner  professor emeritus of chemical engineering  passes away at 84,Howard Brenner  professor emeritus of chemical engineering  died on Feb. 17. He was 84.Brenner’s extraordinary and accomplished academic career spanned more than 60 years. Considered one of the world’s foremost theoreticians in the transport properties of flowing suspensions and multiphase systems  he had a profound impact on the profession through his broad and fundamental research on low Reynolds number fluid-particle hydrodynamics  microfluidics  complex fluids  interfacial transport processes and emulsion rheology  multiphase flow and transport processes in porous media  generalized Taylor dispersion phenomena  and macro transport processes.Brenner coauthored three textbooks. “Low Reynolds Number Hydrodynamics ” written with John Happel in 1965  is one of the most widely cited books in fluid mechanics worldwide. “Interfacial Transport Processes and Rheology ” coauthored with David A. Edwards and Darsh T. Wasan in 1991  covers interfacial phenomena. “Macrotransport Processes ” coauthored with David A. Edwards in 1993  covers multiple length- and time-scale homogenization schemes. During his career  Brenner singly and jointly published more than 200 technical papers and 35 chapters in books  monographs  and proceedings volumes  and presented more than 500 invited seminars and professional lectures.Brenner also directed the research of a large number of PhD students  master’s students  and postdoctoral fellows in the general areas of fluid mechanics and transport processes. These former students now hold or have held academic appointments in a variety of fields  including chemical engineering  mechanical engineering  aerospace engineering  civil engineering  engineering mechanics  and physical chemistry.Raised and educated entirely in New York City and environs  Brenner graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1946  where he took its “chemical course.” Prior to attending college  he worked for almost a year for a chemical consulting firm in lower Manhattan. Brenner received his undergraduate degree from Pratt Institute (1950)  and his master’s (1954) and ScD (1957) from New York University (NYU)  both in chemical engineering. He went on to serve on the chemical engineering faculties of NYU (1955-1966); Carnegie Mellon (1966-1977); the University of Rochester (1977-1981)  where he was department chair; and MIT (1981-2005)  where he was the Willard Henry Dow Professor of Chemical Engineering.Brenner was an enthusiastic researcher whose lifetime work did not end with his retirement. Until three days before his death  despite tremendous physical challenges  he was making the final revisions on a paper that reflected the culmination of almost 10 years’ work  much of it done after he became emeritus. Of this project  he said that he could always continue to find needed revisions  but  in essence  was done with what he believed to be a seminal piece that overturned a theoretical underpinning of fluid dynamics several hundred years old.In the special issue ofChemical Engineering Communicationshonoring Brenner’s 80th birthday in 2009  his former students recounted: “H.B. held everyone to high standards  especially himself  and he was never shy in getting into very deep discussions of the most recent or subtle concepts he was working on (usually  the two went hand in hand). Such discussions were not a rare event; indeed  we can distinctly remember the knock on the door each afternoon that announced his arrival to the students' office. With a smile on his face  H.B. would enter the room  take a chair at the center  and launch into an in-depth discussion of the latest theories under development. These frequent and informal scientific discussions were the epitome of academic endeavor and left an indelible impression on everyone who had the opportunity to work with him.”Brenner took great pleasure in encouraging his students to pursue the pure sciences in their career paths  believing that to be engaged in a world of ideas was a gift they might be as lucky as he to experience.Brenner was recognized by numerous honors and awards  including election to the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering  the American Academy of Mechanics  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.An elected fellow to the American Institute of Chemical Engineers  Brenner received all three major society awards from that organization  each representing a different category of accomplishment: the Alpha Chi Sigma Award (1976) for "outstanding accomplishments in fundamental chemical engineering research"; the William H. Walker Award (1985) for "outstanding contributions to the chemical engineering literature"; and the Warren K. Lewis Award (1999) for "distinguished and continuing contributions to chemical engineering education.”Other awards include the 2001 Fluid Dynamics Prize from the Division of Fluid Dynamics of the American Physical Society  for “his outstanding and sustained research in physico-chemical hydrodynamics  the quality of his monographs and textbooks  and his long-standing service to the fluid mechanics community.” Additionally  he earned the 1995 General Electric Senior Research Gold Medal Award of the American Society for Engineering Education  the 1980 Bingham Medal of the Society of Rheology  and the 1988 American Chemical Society Award in Colloid or Surface Chemistry  as well as the ACS’s 11th Annual Honor Scroll in 1961.During a symposium to honor his 70th birthday in 1999  Brenner said  “Coming from a family of more short-lived ancestors [his mother died in her late 60s and his father in his early 70s]  I will settle for seeing my colleagues at an 80th birthday celebration.”He lived to be productive for many years beyond his 70th birthday  passing away just a month shy of his 85th birthday.Brenner is survived by his wife  Lisa Glucksman; his second wife  Simone; his first wife  Lorraine  and their three children  Leslie  Joyce  and Suzanne; his seven grandchildren  Margo  Alex  Daniel  Julia  Kiera  Max  and Miles; and his sister  Renee Brenner Gould. He was a devoted father and grandfather  offering frequent words of encouragement and advice.The family has requested that gifts be directed to theMIT Chemical Engineering Department (3854800)  in memory of Howard Brenner.

Wayne Andersen  pioneer in visual arts at MIT  dies at 85,Wayne Vesti Andersen  a professor emeritus of history  theory and criticism of art and architecture at MIT  died Jan. 6 at Massachusetts General Hospital at age 85.Andersen was a scholar  author  lecturer  and consultant to corporations and government agencies. His expertise ranged from the finer points of Paul Cezanne’s drawings to the breeding lines of Arabian horses.After completing his PhD at Columbia University  Andersen was brought to MIT in 1965 by then-President Julius Stratton. He was given an academic appointment in the Department of Architecture and a charge to develop a program of visual arts.“Wayne was always a daring explorer of ideas and a congenial  constructive collaborator ” says Stanford Anderson  a professor of history and architecture at MIT. “While he blazed new trails for MIT in contemporary art  we had the valued opportunity to share with Henry A. Millon in the foundation of MIT’s pioneering PhD program in the History  Theory and Criticism of Architecture and Art. He was a dear friend and colleague.”As director of MIT’s Hayden Gallery  Andersen generated national interest in MIT as a sponsor of contemporary art  with original exhibitions of the work of Hans Haacke  Takis  the Park Place Group  and the photographer Minor White  among others. In 1969 he created the “Moon Show” a multimedia exhibit combining film  historic images  Neil Armstrong’s moon photographs  and one of the first public exhibits of moon dust collected by the Apollo 11 astronauts.“Wayne was a towering figure ” says Caroline Jones  a professor of the history of art at MIT. “Tall and commanding until the end  he brought MIT into the contemporary art world with joy and panache. His eyes gleaming with mischief  he helped generations of MIT students and colleagues see the parallels between an inspired hack and the blagues of the avant-garde. His impact on campus  and on the thriving arts community that now characterizes our Institute  is immeasurable.”As chairman of MIT’s Committee on the Visual Arts from 1965 to 1977  Andersen added large-scale sculpture to the campus and inaugurated one of the first “percent for art” programs at any university; the requirement for the MIT collection was that all artworks remain publicly accessible. Early acquisitions included pieces by Henry Moore and Louise Nevelson; an extensive collection of paintings and prints dispersed across the campus; and a print-lending library for students to enhance their dorm rooms. He also brought artists and critics to MIT to engage both students and faculty with ideas in contemporary art.In 1968  Andersen was appointed as a consultant to the Boston Redevelopment Authority for art projects done under a percent-for-art program associated with public spaces built with federal or state funding. In 1969  Frank Morris  then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  engaged Andersen to create a collection of contemporary art for the bank’s new building  designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates.“He clearly had an eye for what was good ” says Bruce Mazlish  a professor emeritus of history at MIT. “He had extraordinary range and depth. Wayne’s was always a questing mind. He will be missed  both as a colleague and as a friend.”Starting in the late 1970s  Andersen was one of the first corporate art consultants to advise companies on how to enrich their environment as part of their corporate identity. He built art collections for companies including IBM  AT&T  Wells Fargo Bank  Northrop Corporation  and Texas Instruments. Many of these collections included integral art: large-scale photography  graphics  murals  and tapestries. In 1986 he founded Vesti Design International  specializing in integral art installations; the firm’s work included interior artwork for the mosque at King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh  Saudi Arabia  and for King Abdulazziz International Airport in Jeddah  Saudi Arabia.Andersen was the author of 14 books  including “Gauguin’s Paradise Lost” (1971  with a second edition in 2013)  which was labeled an “extraordinary study” by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt inThe New York Times; and “The Youth of Cezanne and Zola” (2003)  which was rated among “the best of the best of 2003” by theLos Angeles TimesBook Review.Andersen was born on a farm in Hinton  Iowa  one of 10 children of parents of Danish descent. He revisited his love of farm life by creating Vesti Arabians  an Arabian horse breeding farm that he operated in Woodstock  Vt.  for 10 years. In addition to his MIT position  he was a visiting professor at Harvard  Yale  and Columbia universities.In the last year  Andersen worked on a book of his collected essays  in which he wrote: “I have had a long life of successes guided by evading threats of failure  like a skier flying down an unknown mountainside with no designated route or destination in mind.”Andersen is survived by his wife  Phyllis Andersen  of Boston. He is also survived by a son  Mark Andersen  of Los Angeles  and a daughter  Maja Andersen  of Phoenix  both from his first marriage  to Ebba Stoll.
Robert Alberty  professor emeritus of chemistry and former dean of science  dies at 92,Robert A. Alberty  professor emeritus in the Department of Chemistry and former dean of MIT’s School of Science — whose seminal contributions to the thermodynamics and kinetics of biochemical reactions are still at the forefront of chemistry — passed away on Saturday  Jan. 18  at the age of 92.A member of the MIT faculty since 1967  Alberty led the School of Science from 1967 to 1982  when he returned to teaching and research in physical chemistry. He became professor emeritus in 1991.“Bob’s characterization of enzyme kinetics from 1955 to 1965 remains the model for investigations of enzymatic mechanism ” says chemistry department head Sylvia Ceyer  the J. C. Sheehan Professor of Chemistry. “His work is well-known for its utmost attention to detail  and despite being a demanding scientist  he was the quintessential gentleman — always kind and warm-hearted.”Alberty’s work placed the kinetic model by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten some 30 years earlier on a firm theoretical basis  Ceyer says  by describing the interplay between kinetics and equilibrium. He was also the first to recognize the complexity of the many species of adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP)  she adds  and to develop a rigorous  but easily generalizable  thermodynamic treatment to relate them.Alberty was widely regarded by MIT colleagues as an accomplished educator at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Many of his students and postdocs went on to pursue outstanding research careers; he was particularly proud of those who became members of the National Academy of Sciences — a status he himself achieved in 1965.Alberty was the author or co-author of physical chemistry textbooks that are widely used to this day.Physical Chemistry(Wiley)  a textbook he co-authored with Farrington Daniels in 1955  was his most esteemed and enduring work. Alberty’s refinements to the book spanned more than 50 years  during which time he and his co-authors — most recently Moungi Bawendi and the late Robert J. Silbey  both professors at MIT — updated the volume to meet current trends and standards.Physical Chemistryis still considered the benchmark textbook in the field  and is used in teaching 5.60 (Thermodynamics and Kinetics) in MIT’s Department of Chemistry.“I had the pleasure of watching Professor Alberty — Bob to everyone here — in action during the updating of thePhysical Chemistrytextbook ” says Bawendi  the Lester Wolfe Professor of Chemistry. “Bob was tireless and incredibly organized. He knew the contents of the book to the last detail  [and] rewrote or edited large parts of it  with a clear sense of what he thought should be reorganized to make the text up-to-date. It was an amazing learning experience and a humbling one to watch the two Bobs — Bob Alberty and Bob Silbey — rework the text  especially with Bob Alberty well into his eighties at the time.”“When I was hired at MIT in 1990  it was in anticipation of Bob’s retirement ” Bawendi adds. “But it never felt that Bob ever actually ‘retired ’ as he was still heavily involved for so many years writing theoretical works  textbooks  and active in leadership positions of chemical and scientific organizations. I was lucky to have had the chance to work with Bob.”Alberty’s work onPhysical Chemistryled to invitations to participate in and chair national research committees concerned with laboratory safety standards and chemical disposal. A report he authored for the National Research Council in 1981  “Prudent Practices in the Chemical Laboratory ” sold more copies than any of that organization’s previous publications. Alberty also chaired the committee that wrote a second report  in 1983  “Prudent Practices for the Disposal of Chemicals in the Laboratory.”Alberty was no stranger to senior administrative roles at universities: In 1967  while dean of the Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin at Madison  he was invited to become dean of the School of Science at MIT  as well as a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry. His notable achievements as MIT’s dean of science included the development of a joint MIT-Harvard University MD-PhD program and the establishment of the Cancer Research Center  now the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. He was also the first co-chairman of MIT’s exchange program with Wellesley College and chaired the Institute Committee on Environmental Health and Safety.As dean of science  Alberty “was always available to his colleagues  and always optimistic about finding funding for many endeavors to benefit chemistry and the Institute as a whole ” says Bob Field  the Robert T. Haslam and Bradley Dewey Professor of Chemistry. “He liked nothing better than to convey good news about tenure.”“I overlapped with the late stage of Bob Alberty’s career  after he returned to being ‘just’ a professor following a stint as dean of science ” says Keith Nelson  a professor of chemistry. “Long past official retirement and into emeritus status  Bob had fewer official responsibilities but just as much scientific curiosity  energy  and enthusiasm as ever. So he took advantage of the opportunity to work with few distractions to consolidate much of the last phase of his theoretical research and to write a unique textbook Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions  published in 2005.”This topic is not covered in standard courses  Nelson adds  “largely because the theoretical framework and its applications were developed much more recently than the rest of thermodynamics  and significantly by Bob Alberty. The very next year  Bob published a supplementary text on applications of Mathematica software to problems in biochemical thermodynamics. … [He] was not content to inscribe his scientific achievements in textbook form  but also succeeded in bringing his discipline to life for a new generation of students and scientists.”Alberty spent 30 years as an advisor to the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation and was instrumental in developing many of its programs — including the Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program  which supports young chemistry professors who have demonstrated interest and ability in being outstanding teachers as they are considered for tenure.Born in Winfield  Kan.  Alberty carried out his undergraduate studies at the University of Nebraska  receiving his BS in 1943  followed by an MS from the same university. In 1947  he received his PhD in chemistry from Wisconsin and immediately became an instructor at that institution. He moved up the ranks at Wisconsin  becoming a full professor in 1956. In 1962  he was appointed associate dean of letters and science before being appointed as the dean of the Graduate School in 1963.Alberty received professional awards and accolades including membership in the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Institute of Medicine  and the American Chemical Society.Alberty was predeceased by his wife of 66 years  Lillian; the couple met in high school  when he was president of the chemistry club and she was the club’s secretary. They both attended Wisconsin and married the day after their graduation.Alberty is survived by his three children  Nancy Lou Zant  of Fairfield  Mont.; Steven C. Alberty  of Eugene  Ore.; and Catherine Alberty Baxter  of Roseville  Minn.; by nine grandchildren; and by six great-grandchildren.Services will take place at 11 a.m. on Saturday  Jan. 25  at University Lutheran Church  66 Winthrop St.  Cambridge.
James K. Roberge  professor of electrical engineering  dies at 75,James K. Roberge  a professor of electrical engineering and a member of the MIT faculty since 1967  died Friday  Jan. 10  at age 75. Roberge continued teaching in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) through last semester.Born in Jersey City  N.J.  in 1938  Roberge came to MIT in 1956  earning his SB  SM  and ScD degrees  all in electrical engineering. For nearly all of his professional career  Roberge worked for MIT — from postdoc to full professor  a position he attained in 1976. Starting in 1969  Roberge also performed research as a visiting scientist at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory.At Lincoln Lab  Roberge’s research interests in the areas of electronic circuits and systems design led him to work in a division involved in space communications  instrumentation  and optical communications. His designs have flown on nine satellites.Vincent Chan  the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  headed the division at Lincoln Lab in which Roberge worked. Chan says that Roberge’s most important contributions were in ultrahigh-efficiency power converters for spacecraft and high-precision optical tracking electronics for space-laser communications.“[Roberge] brought together his knowledge of circuit designs  control system theory  and a large dose of ingenuity to design these systems ” Chan notes. Despite the fact that some of Roberge’s work was done in the 1980s and 1990s  Chan says  “it still represents the state of the art.”Roberge was also cited by colleagues for his mentorship of students and of newer faculty. Charles Sodini  the Clarence J. LeBel Professor of Electrical Engineering  notes: “I taught 6.301  Solid-State Circuits  and 6.302  Feedback Systems  as a recitation instructor for Jim. It was a pleasure to learn the material from someone who had it in his DNA.”Roberge was also revered for his teaching and mentoring — encouraging a number of students who are now following in his academic and research footsteps. David Trumper  a professor of mechanical engineering  began his association with Roberge as an undergraduate in 6.301 and 6.302 — classes that he says “opened up analog circuits as a design discipline.”Roberge served as Trumper’s undergraduate thesis advisor  and later as his PhD advisor. Trumper recalls Roberge’s “keen insights and easy confidence that pretty much any problem could be solved if you looked at it from the right perspective.”Kent Lundberg  currently a visiting senior lecturer in EECS  was Roberge’s student while earning his SM and PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. Lundberg — who had taught 6.331 with Roberge since 1994 and co-taught 6.331 with him last semester — says that “knowing Professor Roberge was the best part of my education at MIT.”Through his research and eye for practical application  Roberge received 12 patents and worked with more than 160 consulting clients. He was co-founder of the Hybrid Systems Corporation  later acquired by Sprague  and of the Aerogage Corporation. Roberge also authored several books  including “Operational Amplifiers: Theory and Practice” — a text widely recognized as authoritative.EECS department head Anantha Chandrakasan  the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor of Electrical Engineering  summarized Roberge’s impact in an announcement to colleagues  saying: “Jim was a wonderful colleague  teacher  researcher and mentor. He was legendary for his teaching of analog circuits (6.002  6.301  6.302  6.331) and his approach to these subjects had a profound influence on generations of students.”Roberge is survived by his wife  Nancy J. Roberge; his son  James D. Roberge; and his daughter  Anne E. Roberge. A funeral service will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday  Jan. 14  at the Douglass Funeral Home  51 Worthen Rd.  Lexington  Mass.

Memorial service for Audrey Dobek-Bell to be held Jan. 16,A celebration of the life of Audrey Dobek-Bell will be held on Thursday  Jan. 16  at 3 p.m. at the MIT Chapel. All are invited to join Dobek-Bell’s family and MIT friends for the service and the reception to follow in the Flowers Dining Room in Maseeh Hall (W1).Dobek-Bell was part of the MIT community for 33 years  from her first job as an administrative assistant in the Office of the Corporation in 1979 to her retirement from the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship in 2012.In reflecting with Nancy Kelly  former administrative officer in the Office of the President  in the early 1990s on the changes they had seen during their working lives  Dobek-Bell laughed  remembering the early years of starting the day by simply turning on the typewriter and opening the mail. Known for her poise  however  Dobek-Bell didn’t flinch from the “fire hose” that is life at MIT: Office of the Corporation colleague Susie Kendall remembers her as unflappable.“Audrey loved MIT  and she saved the day on too many occasions to count ” she says. “To have worked with her was not just a pleasure  but an honor.”Dobek-Bell had a great love of language  books  and travel  as well  interests that shaped her professional experiences. After graduating from the State University of New York at Fredonia and before coming to MIT  she taught in Spain  France  and the Netherlands  in addition to Eden  N.Y.  and Williamstown  Mass. Dobek-Bell took a leave abroad after 16 years at the Institute  spending 1995 and 1996 with her husband in Madrid. This special experience strongly influenced her decision to return to campus in an administrative role at the newly created Entrepreneurship Center of the MIT Sloan School of Management (now the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship). While treasured by her colleagues and students for her warmth and charm  Dobek-Bell was especially beloved by those from Spain  for her presence made the center their stateside home.With her excellent judgment and her deep knowledge of MIT  Dobek-Bell was a valuable asset to the launch of the Entrepreneurship Center. She drew key people into its work  contributing substantially to its spirit and to what became the first administrative team there. “Audrey embodied so much of what is great about MIT. Without her  the Institute would not have reached its tremendous levels of success in the area of entrepreneurship ” says Bill Aulet  managing director of the Martin Trust Center. He adds  “She is sorely missed but  as she had wished  her legacy will live on to benefit many students well into the future.”Dobek-Bell died on Oct. 16  2013  her 68th birthday. She is survived by her husband of 38 years  Gene Bell-Villada  three brothers  and a loving extended family.
Elizabeth Johnson  widow of former MIT president Howard Johnson  dies at 92,Elizabeth “Betty” Weed Johnson  the widow of former MIT presidentHoward W. Johnson  died Sunday  Jan. 5. She was 92.The Johnsons joined the MIT community in 1955  when Howard Johnson took a job on the faculty of what is now the MIT Sloan School of Management. Both maintained a deep professional commitment and abiding affection for the Institute for more than five decades — especially during the turbulent years  from 1966 to 1971  when Howard Johnson was MIT’s president.“Betty and Howard Johnson led MIT during perhaps its most tumultuous era ” says Susan Hockfield  who served as MIT’s president from 2004 to 2012. “Mrs. Johnson’s warmth  kindness  and gracious good sense supported and magnificently amplified President Johnson’s leadership. Through the disruptions of the times  they successfully ‘held the center’ while events threatened to tear MIT  and America’s great institutions of higher education  from their foundations.”Hockfield also expressed appreciation for Betty Johnson’s concern for the entire MIT community. “When my family came to MIT ” Hockfield says  “the warmth of Mrs. Johnson’s welcome and her encouraging advice helped us navigate our new lives here. Betty and Howard served as constant beacons of inspiration  of lives well-lived in service to the Institute  the region  and the nation.”Betty Johnson met her husband of 59 years in the late 1940s  as a supervisor at a Chicago department store to which Howard Johnson had been assigned to develop a compensation program. They were married in 1950  and would raise three children. As Howard Johnson moved into academia at the University of Chicago  Betty Johnson worked in the campus personnel office.Moving to MIT in 1955 with her husband  she fell in love with the area. “I love the history and geography of Massachusetts. I like the old and the new ” she explained in a 1970 interview with the Sunday Herald Traveler newspaper. “Massachusetts is a very alive  moving  interesting place.”There were also harrowing experiences for the Johnson family  notably when they lived in the Institute’s official presidential residence at 111 Memorial Dr. (now known as Gray House). In his 1999 memoir “Holding the Center ” Howard Johnson described anti-Vietnam War protests on campus that literally came through the family’s front door: “a four-foot length of steel pipe was thrown through a large window on the first floor ” Howard Johnson wrote  and a protester then “climbed up to another of our first floor windows. Betty was unruffled through most of this.”“She was a warm  empathetic person who’d grown up in the Midwest during the Great Depression ” Betty Johnson’s son  Stephen  told MIT News. “She understood that it was people who made the world go round.” During the campus upheavals of the late 1960s  “she was very protective [of her family]  and sought to create an oasis of calm and support.”“She understood that what made MIT great ” he added  “besides all its brilliant people  is its sense of community” — which she sought to foster “whether entertaining freshman or hosting senior executives. She was a real asset to my father and MIT.”Betty Johnson had a special interest in environmental issues. In 2006  the MIT Women’s League established theElizabeth W. Johnson Fellowship  which “acknowledges Betty’s concern for the environment by enabling an Institute undergraduate to pursue his or her interest in environmental studies.”Betty Johnson was predeceased by her husband  who died in 2009. She is survived by her three children: Stephen Johnson  of Medford  Mass.; Laura Johnson  of Concord  Mass.; and Bruce Johnson  of Mendocino  Calif.  and also survived by three grandchildren: Luke Johnson Rogers  James Lion Johnson  and Oliver Lion Johnson.Memorial gifts may be made to theHoward W. and Elizabeth W. Johnson Fundat MIT.
Biologist Boris Magasanik dies at 94,Boris Magasanik  the Jacques Monod Professor Emeritus of Microbiology  passed away on Dec. 25 at his home in Cambridge. He was 94.Magasanik was recruited by Salvador Luria to join MIT’s Department of Biology in 1960  leaving his post as a professor of bacteriology at Harvard Medical School to help the Institute establish a presence in the then-new field of molecular biology. In the succeeding years  Magasanik crossed disciplinary boundaries between metabolic biochemistry  enzyme regulation  microbial genetics and physiology  and molecular biology  becoming a pioneer in the study of gene regulation.From 1967 to 1977  Magasanik was head of the Department of Biology  leading a period of growth marked by outstanding and imaginative faculty hiring  says Chris Kaiser  who is a MacVicar Professor of Biology at MIT. Throughout his long career  Magasanik was an accomplished and inspiring teacher of both undergraduates and graduate students. His devotion to teaching  Kaiser said  helped establish the biology department as a center of excellence not only for research  but also for education.Magasanik taught several different courses at MIT. Graham Walker  who is an American Cancer Society Research Professor of Biology at MIT  who co-taught a course on microbial physiology with Magasanik for more than three decades  remembers his remarkable ability to weave together various perspectives as he brought the scientific material to life. In 1998  Magasanik helped establish a “lecture/discussion” course  called “Biological Regulatory Mechanisms ” that required undergraduates to read and write about primary research literature  says Alan Grossman  the Praecis Professor of Biology  who started the course with Magasanik. Magasanik continued to teach in both courses until 2010.Born in Kharkov  Ukraine  on Dec. 19  1919  Magasanik spent his formative years in Vienna  pursuing his university degree until the Nazis expelled all Jews from university studies. He then moved to New York  in 1938  where he completed his bachelor’s degree at City College of New York. During World War II  Magasanik served in the U.S. Army as a medical technician  spending more than three years in Europe.After the war  Magasanik returned to New York to pursue his PhD at Columbia University  receiving his degree in 1948. He spent more than a decade at Harvard Medical School  and then joined MIT in 1960 — in part  out of a desire to teach both undergraduate and graduate students.A member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)  the Institute of Medicine  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  Magasanik received many honors  including the NAS’s Waksman Award in 1993 and the Abbott-ASM Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Over the course of his career  Magasanik published many influential papers  primarily on microbial physiology and the regulation of gene expression in yeast and bacteria.For most of his career  Magasanik studied how microbial cells alter expression of metabolic enzymes in response to available nutrients. He was the first to demonstrate nitrogen regulation  which is the process by which bacterial genes required for the assimilation of nitrogen are regulated by the amount of nitrogen available in their environment. His studies of nitrogen regulation in bacteria led Magasanik to fundamental discoveries in bacterial gene regulation  including the identification of a special form of RNA polymerase needed for transcription of nitrogen-regulated genes  and the delineation of the mechanism of conserved intracellular signaling circuits in bacterial cells known as two-component systems.Magasanik played a central role in shaping the trajectory of the Department of Biology at MIT  Kaiser says  steering it toward the burgeoning field of molecular biology. During his time as department head  the department nearly doubled in size and recruited world-class scientists to MIT. After his tenure  “the department was rated as one of the best  if not the best  biology department in the country ” says professor emeritus of biochemistry Gene Brown  who succeeded Magasanik as department head and later served as dean of the School of Science.Highly regarded by his peers  Magasanik was known for the extraordinary breadth of his knowledge. “He was a brilliant polymath ” recalls Kaiser  who met Magasanik as a graduate student in the 1980s. As knowledgeable as Magasanik was in the classroom  he showed unparalleled erudition outside it as well  Kaiser said: “He could speak intelligently about an enormous number of subjects  from history to arts of all different cultures. Boris was a true Renaissance man.”As a scientist  teacher  mentor  and friend  Magasanik had a profound effect on the lives of many. While on sabbatical in Jacques Monod’s lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1959  he and his late wife  Adele  took it upon themselves to teach English to Agnes Ullmann  a microbiologist who is now retired from the Pasteur Institute.“Boris had a phenomenal general culture; we went often to exhibitions and Boris was a perfect guide ” Ullman says. “We will all miss Boris  because he was an exceptional human being and a great friend and scientist.”Magasanik was predeceased by Adele  his wife of many years  in 1991. He is survived by his second wife  Helen Donis-Keller; his stepdaughter  Christine Donis-Keller  and her husband  William Seeley; and by two grandchildren  Parker and Raines.Plans are underway for a memorial service to be held at MIT. Gifts in Magasanik’s memory can be sent to theMuseum of Fine Artsin Boston or to Sancta Maria’sWindsor Housein Cambridge.
Theodore Madden  EAPS professor emeritus  dies at 88,Theodore Madden  or “Ted ” an MIT alumnus and professor emeritus in the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) whose contributions to research and teaching influenced a generation of earth scientists  died Nov. 11 at the age of 88.Madden  who was born in 1925  entered the Institute in 1942 and never left (with the exception of a three-year stint with the U.S. Marines during World War II). He received his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1949 and his PhD in geophysics in 1961; he was already a professor of geophysics at MIT when he received his PhD. He continued teaching at the Institute until he retired in 1995.Whether in the classroom or on the hockey rink  Madden was known for his breadth of academic interests  competitive spirit  and holistic approach to education. He was probably most celebrated for his work on methods for electrical exploration. In 1986  he received the Society of Exploration Geophysicists’ Reginald Fessenden Award in recognition of his “pioneering efforts in the development of frequency domain IP  both in practice and in theory.”Few biographies  however  capture the scope of Madden’s research  which spanned from the core of the Earth to the outer magnetosphere  and included topics as diverse as electromagnetics  seismology  gravity waves  plasma physics  and random networks.Madden was also an accomplished athlete who loved all sports  particularly hockey  soccer  and lacrosse  and received MIT’s award for the most outstanding athlete in 1949. He liked to say that he “majored in sports and minored in physics.” His former students remember that he brought the same intensity to athletics as he did to inverse problems.“He was a great athlete  who wanted his students to excel in life as well as academics ” says Donald Paul  one of Madden’s former students who is now executive director of the Energy Institute  a professor of engineering  and the William M. Keck Chair of Energy Resources at the University of Southern California. “Ted also believed that if you understood the fundamentals and had diverse interests  you could do most anything. As a result  his students have been successful in a broad range of fields both within and beyond the geosciences.”Madden is survived by his wife  Halima; his children Salim  Jennifer  and Nadia ’00; and his grandchildren Laila and Matthew. A memorial at MIT is planned for the spring semester  with further details forthcoming.The Theodore Madden Fellowship Fund was created by EAPS on the occasion of Madden’s retirement.

Stephen H. Crandall  professor emeritus in MechE  dies at 92,Stephen H. Crandall  the Ford Professor of Engineering Emeritus at MIT  a pioneer in random vibrations and rotordynamics  and a leader in transforming mechanics into an engineering science  passed away Oct. 29  in Needham  Mass. He was 92 years old.Crandall was born in the Philippine Islands in 1920. Graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology in the early days of World War II  he joined MIT as a staff member in the Radiation Laboratory in 1942.After earning his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1946  he transferred to the Department of Mechanical Engineering. There  he was appointed to assistant professor of mechanical engineering in 1947  associate professor in 1951  then to professor in 1958. He was named Ford Professor of Engineering in 1975  and an emeritus professor in 1991.Across MIT  Crandall is remembered as an outstanding teacher and scholar  noted for the clarity of his lectures: He spoke slowly  but managed to cover plenty of material. While at MIT  he led the transformation of mechanics into an engineering science  acting as editor of three groundbreaking texts: “Random Vibrations” (1958)  “An Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids” (1959)  and “Dynamics of Mechanical and Electromechanical Systems” (1968). Crandall was a pioneer of random vibrations research  offering the first academic course on the subject in 1958  and subsequently directing MIT’s Acoustics and Vibration Laboratory for 33 years. He published a total of eight books and 160 technical papers.Crandall was professionally active as an engineering consultant and a member of many technical societies. He served as chairman of the Executive Committee of the Applied Mechanics Division and as vice president of Basic Engineering for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); he also served as president of the American Academy of Mechanics. He served as chairman of the U.S. National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and of the Solid Mechanics Panel of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. He was also a member of the Board of the International Commission for Acoustics.Throughout the years  a steady stream of students enjoyed the hospitality of Crandall and his gracious wife  Pat: They generously opened their house in Lincoln  Mass.  to a variety of student groups. Their interest in teaching and supporting foreign students was initiated by their first sabbatical at Imperial College London in 1949 and reinforced by subsequent sabbaticals and lecture tours in Mexico  France  Germany  Israel  Russia  China  Japan  Australia  and South Korea. Crandall learned to speak Spanish  French  and Russian  and enjoyed giving lectures in the local language. Pat chaired MIT’s faculty wives committee  which organized English-language classes for the wives of foreign students.Crandall’s hobbies included Dixieland piano  and he played gigs for many years with the Tabor Hill Jazz Band.Crandall’s professional contributions have been widely recognized. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering  and the Russian Academy of Engineering.The Acoustical Society of America awarded him the Trent-Crede Medal in 1978  and the American Society of Civil Engineers awarded him both the Theodore von Karman Medal  in 1984  and the Freudenthal Medal  in 1996. ASME awarded Crandall the Worcester Reed Warner Medal in 1971; the Timoshenko Medal in 1990; the Den Hartog Award in 1991; and the Thomas K. Caughey Dynamics Award in 2009. He was inducted as an honorary ASME member in 1988.Crandall is survived by his daughter  Jane (Crandall) Kontrimas  with her husband Peter and son Stephen; and by his son  William BC Crandall.A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel on Friday  Feb. 21  2014  at 3 p.m.  followed by a reception at the Hart Nautical Gallery.

Lincoln Palmer Bloomfield  professor emeritus of political science  dies at 93,Professor emeritus of political science Lincoln Palmer Bloomfield died Oct. 30 of respiratory failure. He was 93.Bloomfield was a public servant  educator  and author. He was noted for his work on containing conflict and averting nuclear escalation; developing the role of the United Nations; rationalizing the foreign-policy planning process; and managing future competition in the “global commons” of the Arctic and outer space.Building on experimentation by the RAND Corporation  Bloomfield developed the contemporary model for political military war-gaming and ran many exercises for MIT  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and later the U.S. State Department. He taught four semesters at the Institute of Advanced International Studies  residing in Geneva.A 1941 graduate of Harvard University and a veteran of the U.S. Navy — having served during World War II and with the Office of Strategic Services in Burma and China after the war’s end — Bloomfield served for 11 years at the State Department before returning to Harvard for his master’s in public administration (1952) and his PhD (1956). His thesis was awarded Harvard’s Chase Prize and published by Harvard University Press as “Evolution or Revolution ” the first of his 14 books.At MIT  where he taught for 30 years  from 1961 to 1991  Bloomfield became a tenured professor after his book  “The United Nations and U.S. Foreign Policy: A New Look at the National Interest ” (Little  Brown and Co.  1960) gained wide recognition; leading scholar Hans Morgenthau called it “brilliant” and “pioneering.”Bloomfield directed the MIT Arms Control Project and  with Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling  ran the Joint Harvard-MIT Arms Control Seminar during the 1960s. President Richard Nixon appointed Bloomfield to the Presidential Commission on the United Nations  chaired by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. With IBM and MIT colleague Allen Moulton  Bloomfield developed CASCON  the first computer-aided tool for policy planners using a database of contemporary conflicts  which was awarded the EDUCOM/NCRIPTAL Award for Distinguished Software in Political Science in 1988.During the period of U.S.-Soviet détente  Bloomfield was one of several U.S. civilian and military experts who traveled repeatedly to Moscow  exploring prospects for nuclear disarmament. In 1970  visiting that city’s Institute for the USA and Canada Studies  Bloomfield ran a simulated gaming exercise in which he assigned to his Soviet hosts the role of Israel in a Middle East conflict. He introduced the now-common phrase “coalitions of the willing” as early as 1970 in correspondence with then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. In 1979  he returned to Washington to serve for one year in President Jimmy Carter’s administration as director of global issues on the National Security Council staff.Under the sponsorship of the State Department  Bloomfield lectured in 35 countries and received the department’s Distinguished Visiting Lecturer award. He served on the board of visitors of the National Defense University  and was the sole foreign board member of the Canadian Institute for International Peace and Security.Bloomfield served as a consultant for HBO and appeared  along with Scott Glenn  Nancy Dickerson  Eric Sevareid  Newt Gingrich  and Eugene McCarthy  in the network’s 1984 movie “Countdown to Looking Glass ” which depicted events leading to a nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. For five years  beginning in the late 1980s  he hosted a daily television show  “Fifty Years Ago Today ” on the Monitor Channel  which won a New England Emmy.Bloomfield’s final book and memoir  “Accidental Encounters With History (and Some Lessons Learned) ” was published in 2005. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote that this “scholar  practitioner and former colleague” had fulfilled his responsibility to educate “brilliantly in this well-written account of major events shaping the last half of the twentieth century.”Bloomfield  a 56-year resident of Cohasset  Mass.  was an avid skier  tennis player  golfer  self-taught classical and jazz pianist  and choral singer. He was a board member of the Unitarian Universalist Association and longtime devoted member of the First Parish Church in Cohasset  where he chaired the Parish Committee  served as moderator three times  sang in the choir  and performed in the annual cabarets.Married for 65 years  he is survived by his wife  Irirangi Coates Bloomfield; daughters Pamela and Diana; son Lincoln Jr.; grandsons Nicholas Bloomfield Culver and Adrian Bloomfield Culver; and granddaughter Alison Noelle Bloomfield.A memorial service will be held at the First Parish Church in Cohasset at 11 a.m. on Saturday  Nov. 16. Donations in Bloomfield’s honor may be made to the First Parish Church  23 North Main St.  Cohasset  MA 02025  or to a charitable cause of the donor’s choosing.
Semiconductor research pioneer Peter Wolff dies at 89,Peter A. Wolff  professor emeritus of physics  a semiconductor research pioneer  visionary science administrator and an indispensable guide for MIT physicists seeking careers in industry  died on Sept. 5 due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease. A native of Oakland  Calif.  and a longtime resident of Cambridge  Wolff was 89.“Wolff served the MIT community extraordinarily well for more than 30 years ” says Marc Kastner  dean of the School of Science and the Donner Professor of Science at MIT. “In addition to his own research contributions  Peter laid the foundation of what has become one of the strongest condensed matter physics efforts in the world.”Wolff’s focus within condensed matter physics was on the physics of metals  insulators and  especially  semi-conductors  whose properties form the core technology of all electronics  from computers to solar cells.His research career began at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s  just after the transistor was invented; his work there retains significance today. Physicists continue to cite his 1961 paper — co-authored with 1972 Nobel Laureate and MIT alumnus J. Robert Schrieffer ’53 (physics) — about 25 times a year  and his scientific legacy continues at MIT. “The most important work of my own group is on the Kondo problem in semiconductor nanostructures  which is one connection of my work with his ” Kastner says.In work that began in the 1960s at Bell Labs and continued into the 1990s  Wolff also developed the theory of how light interacts with unpaired electron spins in semiconductors  and he made important contributions to the behavior of plasmas in metals  especially at metal surfaces.In a co-authored 1998 paper  Wolff showed that a metal film with holes in it could transmit light efficiently  even when the wavelength of the light is much larger than the size of the holes. “This was completely unexpected ” Kastner says.Wolff showed that this could be explained theoretically using the interaction between the light and the plasma in the metal at the surface. The 1998 publication is still cited more than 200 times annually.“As a scientist  he appreciated the importance of basic and of broadly applied research ” says Robert Birgeneau  former dean of the School of Science at MIT. “His research experiences in academe and in industry were great resources for students.”A visionary leader for MIT physicsWolff joined the MIT faculty in 1970  charged with teaching  conducting research and establishing condensed matter physics — then known as solid-state physics — as a new discipline within the department. Within three years  he had successfully applied his industry management experience to academic life.He assembled a world-class research group  hiring Kastner in 1973; John Joannopoulos  now the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physicsand director of the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies  in 1974; and  in 1975  Birgeneau  who recently served as chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley.Joannopoulos says he felt “extremely fortunate to have Wolff as a mentor to mold and nurture my evolution as a scientist and teacher.”Wolff’s “easy-going personality  altruism  wisdom and vision were instrumental in creating a working environment that was at once both cutting-edge and extremely collegial ” Joannopoulos adds. “I shall miss him deeply.”Named director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics in 1976  Wolff supported the hiring of Erich Ippen ’62  the Elihu Thomson Professor of Electrical Engineeringand professor emeritus of physics; and Henry Smith  a former professor of electrical engineering and founding director of MIT’s NanoStructures Laboratory.Wolff’s research impressed Ippen  especially a 1966 paper that presented a theory of light scattering by free electrons in semiconductors. That work was “before its time since no lasers were available then to test the theory ” Ippen says.Another article — Wolff’s review chapter in the 1977 book "Nonlinear Optics" — has retained importance to Ippen. “That book  well worn  with binding falling apart  is still on the shelf next to my desk at MIT ” he says. “The subject of ultrafast and nonlinear optics with free electrons in semiconductors and metals is important in some photonic applications today.”Ippen owns another well-worn Wolff memento: the tennis racket he gave Ippen when he stopped playing his regular  ferocious game. Wolff pursued his other passions — hiking  gardening and art — throughout his life.In fact  Wolff’s passion for art led him to leadership in that area  too. A collector of Native American  Inuit and abstract expressionist art  he actively supported the arts at MIT and served as chair of the MIT Council for the Arts in 1987.Fostering research innovationsIn 1981  Wolff became director of the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory. The “MagLab ” founded in 1963  drew researchers from far beyond the Institute to conduct research requiring the world's most powerful magnets.Wolff’s flair for fostering successful collaborations among researchers and students flourished during his MagLab years — 1981 to 1987. Always alert to innovative research  he encouraged two Bell Labs physicists  Horst Stormer and Dan Tsui  to conduct groundbreaking experiments at the MagLab facility. In 1998  Stormer and Tsui shared the Nobel Prize in physics with MIT alumnus Robert B. Laughlin PhD ’79 for their discovery and explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect.Related to high-energy physics  the fractional quantum Hall effect may help scientists understand the quantum structure of the vacuum throughout the space-time of the universe. Wolff described a classic MIT mix of excitement and risk in launching the trio’s Nobel experiment. Squeezing a large high-field magnet into a tiny space with very low-temperature equipment was a “gamble ” he said in a 1998Tech Talkinterview: “There was a real chance it wouldn't work.”At one point  “The whole inside of the magnet blew up  and pieces literally hit the ceiling. They thought they had wrecked the equipment  but it survived ” Wolff toldTech Talk. Undeterred  the team went on.Team-building among scientists and across generations was the core of Wolff’s leadership style: At the MagLab  he both supported Stormer and Tsui in conducting new experiments and arranged their supervision of MIT graduate students working at the lab.Thanks to Wolff  Greg Boebinger PhD ’86 was one of those graduate students. Now director of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University  Boebinger recalled his former mentor’s “unswerving focus on two things: getting the science done  and providing opportunities for advancing a junior person’s career. He was a real gentleman and a real gem of a human being.”The indispensable postgrad guideWolff retired from MIT in 1989. He served as a Fellow at the NEC Research Institute at Princeton University from 1989 to 1994  and then returned to the Institute in 1994 as a senior lecturer-emeritus to lead the physics department’s physics and industry forum.Many of his colleagues feel Wolff’s years of directing graduate students towards industry opportunities were among his most valuable contributions to MIT physics.In 1996 The Chronicle of Higher Educationrecognized Wolff and his efforts at MIT in making science doctoral candidates aware of career options outside academia through seminars featuring physicists who worked as management consultants  patent lawyers and business owners.“Students used to rely on their faculty members to get them jobs ” Wolff toldThe Chronicle. “What’s out there is changing exceedingly fast. Internships give them valuable contacts.”Wolff received the bachelor’s and PhD degrees in physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1945 and 1951  respectively. He is co-author  with P.M. Platzman  of "Waves and Interactions in Solid-State Plasmas" (1973)  a textbook still in use today.Wolff’s wife  artist Catherine Vance Carroll  died in 2000. He is survived by his daughter  Mia  an artist living in New York City; a son  Whitney  of Wayland  Mass.  and three grandsons and one granddaughter.To share stories celebrating Wolff’s life or to express condolences  please visit the memorial website at:forevermissed.com/peter-adalbert-wolff/
Ann Wolpert  director of libraries  has died at 70,Ann Wolpert  MIT’s director of libraries since 1996  has died after a brief illness. She was 70 years old.Wolpert was a pioneer in digital stewardship  bringing to the MIT community a deep understanding of scholarship  of research  and of the library’s broader mission to preserve and disseminate knowledge. Under her leadership  the MIT Libraries developed DSpace  a milestone in digital libraries that catalyzed the institutional repository movement.Wolpert began work at MIT just as the Internet was emerging  and her tenure was marked by her passionate response to the opportunity and upheaval that resulted for research libraries. In scientific  research  and university communities around the world  a debate  still unresolved  came to the fore: how the decades-old system of peer-reviewed scholarly journals ought to operate in the digital world.Wolpert became a leading voice in that discussion; she argued for unrestricted online access to journal articles. In a February 2013 essay in theNew England Journal of Medicine  she not only made the case for such access: She also called it an inevitability. “There is no doubt ” she wrote  “that the public interests vested in funding agencies  universities  libraries  and authors  together with the power and reach of the Internet  have created a compelling and necessary momentum for open access. It won’t be easy  and it won’t be inexpensive  but it is only a matter of time.”Though Wolpert made her case forcefully  she was not dismissive of concerns about how open access might work in practice  and she upheld the value of peer review. “The fact ” she wrote  “that faculty members and researchers donate to publishers the ownership of their research articles — as well as their time and effort as reviewers — does not mean that there are no expenses associated with the production of high-quality publications. For all its known flaws  no one wants to destroy peer-reviewed publication.”Hal Abelson  the Class of 1922 Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT and founding director of both Creative Commons and the Free Software Foundation  remembers Wolpert as “one of the great intellectual leaders at MIT.” She fused  he says  a mix of business experience from her earlier career with serious academic curiosity and integrity. “Ann was funny  warm  caring  and remarkably fair ” Abelson says.“She believed in open access  but it went deeper than that ” he adds. “Her central insight was that in the age of the Internet  a great research library could serve not only as a window into scholarly output for given members of university and research communities  but also as a window for the world at large into the scholarly enterprise. That was a great and thrilling idea  and she pursued it deftly and with great respect for the full spectrum of faculty views.”MIT President L. Rafael Reif  in his previous role as provost  worked closely with Wolpert. “I knew her to be very dedicated to MIT  and she thought carefully about how our library system could best serve the Institute and beyond ” he says. “She was an excellent steward of our scholarship — and a very dear colleague. I will miss her very much.”As director of libraries  Wolpert managed the MIT Libraries and the MIT Press. The MIT Libraries — with five major subject collections  the Institute Archives and Special Collections  and a staff of 170 — support the research and teaching needs of the Institute community. The MIT Press publishes around 30 journals and 220 books each year in a wide range of subjects.Wolpert also served on MIT’s Committee on Intellectual Property  the Council on Educational Technology  the OpenCourseWare Faculty Advisory Committee  the Deans’ Group  and Academic Council. She also served as chair of the board of directors ofMIT Technology Review.In 2000  Wolpert helped lead the MIT Libraries’ collaboration with Hewlett-Packard to build DSpace  an open-source digital archive for faculty output that has been adopted by more than 1 000 institutions worldwide.In 2009  Wolpert was instrumental in the conception and passage of the MIT Faculty Open Access Policy  whereby faculty authors give MIT nonexclusive permission to disseminate their journal articles for open access through DSpace@MIT. It was the first institution-wide policy of its kind in the United States. Open sharing of MIT scholarship has given readers around the world access to the results of MIT’s research.Wolpert continued to be a player in other “startups” that have the potential to transform the way research institutions and their libraries collaborate to solve problems big enough to call for a collective response. She referred to these as “solutions at scale.” Among them is the Digital Preservation Network (DPN)  to whose inaugural board she was recently appointed. DPN was created to ensure that the scholarly record is preserved for future generations by using a shared  national preservation ecosystem composed of several federated  replicating nodes containing redundant copies of all deposits to protect against catastrophic loss.Wolpert was a leader in her field. "Ann has been a trailblazer in defining the new roles of libraries in an era of data-intensive scholarship " says Cliff Lynch  executive director of the Coalition for Networked Information. "Her work in the development of institutional repositories as a means of curating and making public the research contributions of universities has fundamentally reshaped strategies for managing scholarship at a national and international level. She will be greatly missed."Prior to joining MIT  Wolpert was executive director of library and information services at the Harvard Business School. Her experience previous to Harvard included management of the information center of Arthur D. Little  Inc.  an international management and consulting firm  where she also worked on various consulting assignments. More recent consulting assignments took her to the University of New Mexico  Cornell University and Adelphi University in New York  the campuses of INCAE in Costa Rica and Nicaragua  MASDAR in Abu Dhabi  the League of European Research Libraries in Amsterdam  the National Library of China  and the Malaysia University of Science and Technology.In 2005 Wolpert served as president of the Association of Research Libraries and was most recently a member of its Influencing Public Policies Steering Committee. She served on the boards of directors of the Boston Library Consortium  the National Academies’ Board of Research Data and Information (BRDI)  DuraSpace  and DPN  and on the steering committee of the Coalition for Networked Information. She also served as a publications advisor to the Massachusetts Medical Society.Wolpert received a BA from Boston University and an MLS from Simmons College  where she was an honorary trustee and a member of the board of advisors of the PhD Program in Managerial Leadership in the Information Professions at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science.Wolpert is survived by her husband  Samuel A. Otis Jr.  and a large extended family.This article will be updated to include information about memorial services for Wolpert as that information becomes available.
Robert E. Ogilvie  DMSE professor emeritus  dies at 89,Robert E. Ogilvie  professor emeritus of metallurgy in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering  passed away after brief illness on Sept. 3. He was 89.Ogilvie’s academic foundation in metallurgy and his insatiable curiosity led him to become a world-renowned expert in the detection of art forgeries  the construction of samurai swords  and the analysis of meteorites. His diverse research interests connected him to many communities where he formed strong friendships.Born in Wallace  Idaho  in 1923  Ogilvie served in the Navy during World War II  and then pursued undergraduate studies at Gonzaga University and the University of Washington. He came to MIT for graduate school in 1950  studying x-ray absorption analysis with Professor John T. Norton. His graduate research led to the development of the electron microbeam probe and the founding of AMR  Inc. with Norton.Also at that time  he began working with William Young  founder of the Research Lab at the Museum of Fine Arts  Boston  and developed a long collaboration and supportive relationship with what is now the Department of Conservation and Collections Management at the MFA  as well as with conservators and conservation scientists there and elsewhere. He was instrumental in establishing the series of workshops and publications on the Application of Science in the Examination of Works of Art. His use of the electron microprobe in detecting forgeries and authenticating art was the subject of cover stories inTechnology ReviewandSaturday Review.Another application of the electron microanalyzer was the examination of meteorites; the instrument could determine the objects’ thermal history and the size of the original body of which the meteorite was a fragment. Ogilvie was a member of the Harvard-Smithsonian Meteorite Discussion group  and in 2000 he was recognized for his long-time involvement and contributions with a named minor planet  3973 Ogilvie.Ogilvie had a long fascination with the creation and structure of samurai swords  leading him to visit swordmakers in Japan  including the famous Gassan family. His extensive collection of samples and data has been invaluable for students and scholars.At MIT  he taught “Fundamentals of Crystallography and X-Ray Diffraction ” “Electron Optics ” “Materials Laboratory ” and “Celestial Navigation.” He directed the X-Ray and Electron Optics Lab at MIT and served as president of the Electron Probe Analysis Society of America. An avid sailor  he sailed “Op-Tiki ” a 36-foot Cheoy Lee ketch  around the world with his son Rob.Ogilvie is survived by children Claudia Ogilvie of Pittsfield  Mass.; Marylee Bergin of Ridgewood  N.J.; and Rob Scott Ogilvie of Nashville  Tenn.  as well as grandchildren Robert C. Ogilvie  John G. Ogilvie  Alex Bergin and Zoe Bergin. A memorial will be held at the MIT Chapel on Sept. 28th from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the St. Labre Indian School  1000 Tongue River Rd.  Ashland  MT 59004.
Peter Reich  former chief of psychiatry at MIT Medical  dies at 82,Peter Reich  MIT Medical’s chief of psychiatry from 1989 to 2002  passed away in New York’s Adirondack Mountains on Aug. 11 after a battle with leukemia. He was 82.Reich graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1956 and later served as the head of the Division of Psychiatry at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He was also a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.Reich’s impact and presence on the MIT campus were widespread during his time here. “He immediately became part of the community and quickly made ties with faculty  deans and administrators ” MIT Medical psychiatrist Lili Gottfried says. “He was incredibly active and engaged.”“Peter led the Mental Health service in a way that brought the best out of multiple disciplines ” Medical Director William Kettyle says. “He was very forward-thinking and helped develop a platform of care where everyone was working together to support the mental health needs of the community.”While at MIT  Reich was tremendously dedicated to his staff  patients and the MIT community. “He was a role model and a teacher ” Gottfried says. “He led by example  was graceful in the face of adversity  and always went the extra mile for those under his care.”After leaving MIT  Reich continued to practice medicine. He had a core of devoted  long-term patients whom he saw regularly until his death.Reich is survived by his wife Lee  brother Charles  son Daniel  daughter Alice  and four grandchildren.Donations in his memory may be made to: the Adirondack Council  P.O. Box D-2  Elizabethtown  N.Y. 12932. A memorial service will be held on Saturday  Nov. 2  at 2:00 p.m. in the Wong Auditorium of theMIT Tang Center.
Kenneth Stevens  professor emeritus in EECS  dies at 89,Kenneth Stevens  the Clarence J. LeBel Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT  whose pioneering work at the intersection of engineering and linguistics helped earn him the National Medal of Science  died Aug. 19 in Clackamas  Ore.  from complications of Alzheimer’s disease. He was 89.Born in Toronto on March 23  1924  to British-born parents  Stevens lived there until 1948  earning both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering physics from the University of Toronto. Having lost an eye to cancer when he was four years old  Stevens was ineligible for military service during World War II  but after completing his master’s  he stayed at the university for three more years  teaching returning soldiers under the Veterans Rehabilitation Act  the Canadian equivalent of the G.I. Bill. One of these students was his older brother  Pete.In 1948  Stevens came to MIT as a doctoral student in electrical engineering. He would spend the next 59 years at the Institute  joining the faculty in 1954 and retiring  in 2007  at age 83.In anoral historyrecorded for the American Institute of Physics  Stevens recalled that  when he was finishing his master’s  “control theory was a big thing  so I did a master’s thesis on what we called servomechanisms.” He expected that he might continue that work at MIT.But  as it happened  MIT professor of communications engineering Leo Beranek — also one of the founders of BBN Technologies  a research and development organization that is now a subsidiary of Raytheon Co. — needed a teaching assistant for a class on acoustics. “Beranek noticed that in my vita  I had once taken a course in acoustics  so he got in touch with me and asked if I would be a teaching assistant ” Stevens recalled. “So my transition to acoustics was very much by chance.”Originator of the ‘quantal theory of speech’That chance transition launched him on a career that culminated in his winning of the National Medal of Science in 1999. Stevens is best known for his “quantal theory of speech ” which explored why — despite the apparent diversity of sounds across different languages — human speech actually exploits only a small fraction of the sounds that the vocal tract can produce.In 1952  while Stevens was completing his doctorate  the MIT linguist Morris Halle  together with colleagues Gunnar Fant and Roman Jakobson  proposed that all human speech sounds could be described as combinations of 20-odd “distinctive features ” such as the placement of the tip of the tongue  the shape of the tongue  whether the glottis (voice box) was opened or closed  the shape of the lips  and so on.Stevens  who collaborated closely with all three men  observed that these distinctive features seemed to describe configurations of the vocal tract’s “articulators” — such as the tongue  glottis and lips — in which small deviations had little effect on the sounds produced. This is by no means true of all configurations: In most cases  small deviations would actually yield large sonic differences. But  Stevens argued  language users would naturally converge on the more stable configurations  which would lead to greater consistency in sound production.Quantal theory was not  however  just a theory of speech production; it was also a theory of speech recognition. If humans had a limited repertory of sounds that they could produce reliably  then the auditory system may very well have evolved to key in on them. Stevens spent much of his career indefatigably investigating the implications of quantal theory  both experimentally and through mathematical modeling  frequently in collaboration with Halle and  later  with Samuel Jay Keyser  another MIT linguist.A draw for graduate studentsAlong the way  he advised more than 60 graduate students — including four after his retirement  when he and his second wife  Sharon Manuel  moved to Oregon.“When I was looking for a place to get my doctorate  all I knew was that I wanted to study with Ken Stevens ” says Victor Zue  the Delta Electronics Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. “I didn’t come to MIT and then find Ken Stevens. I wanted to study with Ken  and OK  he’s at MIT  so I guess that’s where I will apply.”“I always remember Ken as an incredibly tolerant advisor ” Zue adds. “He always allowed people the latitude to explore areas that weren’t central to his own interests.” As Dennis Klatt — who developed the speech synthesizer used by Stephen Hawking  among many others  as a researcher in Stevens’ group — once put it  “As a leader  Ken is known for his devotion to students and his miraculous ability to run a busy laboratory while appearing to manage by a principle of benevolent anarchy.”Joseph Perkell — who took a summer job in Stevens’ group in 1964  returned as a PhD student in 1969  and remained with the group as a research scientist until his own retirement last year — recalls a particularly telling instance of Stevens’ devotion his to students. When he began working with Stevens  Perkell was a dental student at Harvard University  and  he recalls  “I did some work that Ken thought would make a good research monograph.” After completing his dental degree  however  Perkell went on active duty for two years as a dental officer in the Army.“While I was in the Army  Ken took the work that I had done and put it together and wrote it up and submitted it to MIT Press — with just my name on it ” Perkell recalls. “So my first publication was a hardbound research monograph  and I was the sole author  even though he was the one who pulled the writing together. That’s the kind of person he was.”Beyond MIT  a love of the outdoorsStevens married his first wife  Phyllis  in 1957; together they had four children  two of whom went on to careers in the sciences. Stevens’ son Michael  a research physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington  recalls that  outside the lab and the classroom  Stevens loved the outdoors — skiing  hiking  camping and canoeing.Michael Stevens remembers one summer in particular: His parents decided to rent a van and drive from Cambridge to Yellowstone National Park and back  camping out along the way  with their own children and two of their children’s friends — “an enormous undertaking  by any measure ” he says. “I remember that  lying down in the tent every night  he would put his hands behind his head  and he would say  ‘This is the life.’”When they arrived at Yellowstone  the first night was cold enough that several of the campers took refuge in the van. Michael Stevens recalls waking early to find his father etching a fake claw print with his fingernail in the frost on the van’s windshield. When the rest of the group woke up  he played along with his father’s tale of a nocturnal ursine visitation.Stevens’ first marriage ended in divorce in 1981  and in 1994 he married Manuel  a linguist who had received her PhD from Yale University in 1987. In his mid-70s  Stevens became a father again when the couple adopted two infant girls from China. Each of the girls — Kendra and MacKenzie — has her father’s first name embedded in hers  along with their mother’s surname.“He was much more active  physically  than I am  so he would do more running around with them ” Manuel says. “He was a modern dad. He at least had plans of doing 50 percent of the work around the house.” But  she adds  he had some difficulty realizing those plans as  well into his 70s  “he was still working 60  70 hours a week.”“His personality was unique ” Michael Stevens says. “He had no pretensions about him. He had no arrogance about him. He was humble until the very end.”Stevens is survived by his wife  Sharon Manuel  of Clackamas  Ore.  and their two children  Kendra and MacKenzie. He is survived by four grown children by his first wife  Phyllis Stevens: Rebecca Stevens of Silver Spring  Md.  Andrea Stevens of Schwenksville  Pa.  Michael Stevens of Clarksville  Md.  and John Stevens of Kenmore  N.Y. Stevens is also survived by five grandchildren.Stevens’ family asks thatdonations be made in his nameto the Alzheimer’s Association.
Path-breaking historian Pauline Maier dies at age 75,The eminent historian Pauline Maier  whose award-winning books cast new light on Revolutionary-era America and the foundations of U.S. democracy  died Aug. 12 in Cambridge  Mass.  after a battle with lung cancer. She was 75.Maier  who served as the William Kenan Jr. Professor of History at MIT  had been a member of the Institute’s faculty since 1978. Her work often recast conventional wisdom about 18th-century America  reconstructing long-forgotten public debates over the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution while bringing crucial figures in American political history into sharper focus.Maier’s best-known books include “American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence” (1997)  a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award  and “Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution  1787-1788” (2010)  winner of the George Washington Book Prize. Both works demonstrated the vitality of local and state-level political debates at the nation’s founding.Even as Maier’s work brought textbook accounts of American history into question  she herself engaged the greater public by writing new history textbooks for college students and younger students alike — part of a career-long commitment to making history vivid and accessible for all.“We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Pauline Maier ” said Deborah Fitzgerald  the Kenin Sahin Dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences at MIT. “One of the key intellectual figures in her field  Pauline was also a leader at MIT — a great historian and scholar who understood the pulse of the Institute and helped guide and improve our community in profound ways. Through her research  award-winning publications  and superb teaching  Pauline inspired generations of young historians of the Colonial period. Her classes for MIT undergraduates — for example  on the U.S. Constitution — were learning experiences that her students still remembered decades later. In her classroom  Pauline brilliantly embodied our mission to empower MIT students with cultural and historical perspectives  and an understanding of the world’s complexities. We will miss her enormously.”From Revolution to ratificationPauline Rubbelke was born in St. Paul  Minn.  on April 27  1938. She received her undergraduate degree from Radcliffe College in 1960  majoring in American history and literature  and received a Fulbright Scholarship for study at the London School of Economics the following year. As an undergraduate working at Harvard’s student newspaper  theCrimson  she met her future husband  Charles Maier  a historian of modern Europe who is now the Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History at Harvard University; the couple married in 1961  in Oxford  England  and had three children.Maier pursued her PhD in history at Harvard  and in 1968 completed her dissertation  advised by Bernard Bailyn  on the formation of American opposition to British rule in the decade before the Declaration of Independence. Maier’s thesis became the basis for her first book  “From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain  1765-1776 ” published in 1972.After receiving her doctorate  Maier joined the history faculty at the University of Massachusetts at Boston  where she taught from 1968 until 1977. Maier then served on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin for one year before accepting a position as professor of history at MIT. Maier led MIT’s history faculty from 1979 to 1988.Maier’s second book  “The Old Revolutionaries: Political Lives in the Age of Samuel Adams ” appearing in 1980  looked in depth at the lives of five Revolutionary leaders  including Adams  in the years leading up to 1776. “American Scripture” drew widespread praise for its recasting of the public debates over the Declaration of Independence. In it  Maier presented a deep analysis of the founding document’s evolution — from statement of revolutionary intent into one of national principles — and discussed dozens of local “declarations of independence” issued in America during 1776. “American Scripture” was named one of the 11 best books of 1997 byThe New York Times Book Review.“Ratification ” Maier’s most recent book  reconstructed and examined the often-tempestuous state-level debates over the ratification of the U.S. Constitution — which greatly strengthened the nation  then financially weak  by adding elements such as taxing powers  while also generating opposition for the same reasons. As Maier detailed  amendments recommended in the course of the ratification debates in the states helped form the Bill of Rights.The work was named one of the top 10 books of 2010 byThe Wall Street Journal; Gordon Wood  an American historian at Brown University  called it a “wonderful contribution” to the field  while Richard Beeman  a historian at the University of Pennsylvania  said it “will stand as the definitive account of the story of the ratification of the Constitution for many decades to come.” The work also won the Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award.History for everyoneMaier’s books were intended for both general and scholarly audiences  and she invested additional effort in furthering public understanding of history. She authored “The American People: A History” (1986)  a middle-school textbook covering American history from its beginnings through 1984. She also co-authored a 2002 college textbook  “Inventing America: A History of the United States ” with Merritt Roe Smith of MIT  Alex Keyssar of Harvard  and Daniel Kevles of Yale University.In addition to her books and textbooks  Maier produced more than 30 articles published in scholarly journals  edited volumes  and other publications  and wrote book reviews for publications includingThe New York Times Book Reviewand theWilliam and Mary Quarterly.Maier received prestigious fellowships and grants including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and multiple fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1998  Maier won MIT’s James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award  which recognizes extraordinary professional accomplishment and is given to one faculty member each year.Maier’s work  prodigious energy for teaching  and commitment to frank truth-seeking in the public sphere made a lasting impression on those who knew her.“Her scholarship  perspective  personality and dedication made her a remarkable MIT citizen ” former MIT President Charles M. Vest said. “Her historical writing displayed first-rate research but also was highly accessible and readable. I used to kid her because she once gave a lecture at the University of Virginia (‘Mr. Jefferson’s University’)  the thesis of which was that Jefferson is our most overrated president. Now that is sticking your neck out.”
Amar Bose ’51  SM ’52  ScD ’56  Bose Corporation’s founder  has died at 83,Amar Bose ’51  SM ’52  ScD ’56  a former member of the MIT faculty and the founder of Bose Corporation  has died. He was 83.Dr. Bose received his bachelor’s degree  master’s degree and doctorate from MIT  all in electrical engineering. He was asked to join the faculty in 1956  and he accepted with the intention of teaching for no more than two years. He continued as a member of the MIT faculty until 2001.During his long tenure at MIT  Dr. Bose made his mark both in research and in teaching. In 1956  he started a research program in physical acoustics and psychoacoustics: This led to his development of many patents in acoustics  electronics  nonlinear systems and communication theory.Throughout his career  he was cited for excellent teaching. In a 1969 letter to the faculty  then-dean of the School of Engineering R. L. Bisplinghoff wrote  “Dr. Bose is known and respected as one of M.I.T.’s great teachers and for his imaginative and forceful research in the areas of acoustics  loudspeaker design  two-state amplifier-modulators  and nonlinear systems.”Paul Penfield Jr.  professor emeritus of electrical engineering  was a colleague of Dr. Bose  and he recalls what made Dr. Bose different. “Amar was personally creative ” he said  “but unlike so many other creative people  he was also introspective. He could understand and explain his own thinking processes and offer them as guides to others. I’ve seen him do this for several engineering and management problems. At some deep level  that is what teaching is really all about. Perhaps that helps explain why he was such a beloved teacher.”Dr. Bose received the Baker Teaching Award in 1963-64; he would receive further awards in later years. In 1989  the Bose Award for Excellence in Teaching was established by the School of Engineering to recognize outstanding contributions to undergraduate education by members of its faculty. The award was established in order to serve as a tribute to the quality of Dr. Bose’s teaching; it is the School’s highest award for teaching. In 1995  the School established another teaching award  the Junior Bose Award: recipients are chosen from among School of Engineering faculty members who are being proposed for promotion to associate professor without tenure.“Amar Bose was an exceptional human being and an extraordinarily gifted leader ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif said. “He made quality mentoring and a joyful pursuit of excellence  ideas and possibilities the hallmark of his career in teaching  research and business. I learned from him  and was inspired by him  every single time I met with him. Over the years  I have seen the tremendous impact he has had on the lives of many students and fellow faculty at MIT. This proud MIT graduate  professor and innovator was a true giant who over decades enriched the Institute he loved with his energy  dedication  motivation and wisdom. I have never known anyone like him. I will miss him. MIT will miss him. The world will miss him.”In 1964  Dr. Bose started Bose Corporation based on research he conducted at MIT. From its inception  the company has remained privately owned  with a focus on long-term research.“Dr. Bose founded Bose Corporation almost 50 years ago with a set of guiding principles centered on research and innovation. That focus has never changed  and never will ” said Bob Maresca  president of Bose Corporation. “Bose Corporation will remain privately held  and stay true to Dr. Bose’s ideals. We are as committed to this as he was to us. Today and every day going forward  our hearts are with Dr. Bose; and we will do everything we can to make him proud of the company he built.”In 2011  to fulfill his lifelong dream to support MIT education  Dr. Bosegave to MIT the majority of the stockof Bose Corporation in the form of nonvoting shares. Under the terms of the gift  dividends from those shares will be used by MIT to sustain and advance MIT’s education and research mission. MIT cannot sell its Bose shares  and does not participate in the management or governance of the company.In expressing appreciation to Dr. Bose on the occasion of the gift  MIT’s then-president  Susan Hockfield  said of him  “His insatiable curiosity propelled remarkable research  both at MIT and within the company he founded. Dr. Bose has always been more concerned about the next two decades than about the next two quarters.”“Amar Bose was a legend at MIT ” said MIT Chancellor Eric Grimson  who served as a faculty colleague of Dr. Bose in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “He was an incredible teacher  an inspiring mentor  a deep and insightful researcher. He has influenced multiple generations of students  both directly through the classroom and laboratory  and through the many students he influenced who have themselves pursued careers as faculty  propagating Professor Bose’s approach to mentorship and teaching.”Dr. Bose was given many awards and honors during his lifetime. He was a Fulbright Postdoctoral Scholar  an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.Vanu G. Bose ’87  SM ’94  PhD ’99  son of Dr. Bose  said  “Personally  my single greatest educational experience at MIT was being a teaching assistant for my father in his acoustics course (6.312). While my father is well known for his success as an inventor and businessman  he was first and foremost a teacher. I could not begin to count the number of people I’ve met who’ve told me that my father was the best professor they ever had and how taking 6.01 from him changed their life.“My father’s 66-year relationship with MIT was an integral part of his life. He would often talk about his mentors  professors Ernst Guillemin  Norbert Wiener  Y. W. Lee and Jerome Wiesner  as having played critical roles in shaping his life and work. It was because of everything that MIT did for him that my father was so pleased to be able to give back to MIT through his gift.”Gifts in memory of Dr. Amar G. Bose may be made to MIT and will be directed to undergraduate scholarship support  building upon Dr. Bose's legacy of support for students: contact Bonny Kellermann '72  Director of Memorial Gifts  atbonnyk@mit.edu  for details. Gifts may also be directed to the Lahey Clinic.This article will be updated with information about plans to honor Dr. Bose’s memory as details become available.
Robert Meservey  pioneering MIT physicist  dies at 92,Robert Hilton Meservey  a longtime MIT research physicist  accomplished skier and Army veteran  died from a stroke on June 18 in Cambridge  Mass. He was 92.After receiving his PhD from Yale University in 1961  Meservey joined the low-temperature physics research group at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington  Mass.  the town where he lived for 25 years. In 1963  he moved to the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory at MIT  where he helped with the installation of the low-temperature facilities for the laboratory and developed a vacuum evaporation and measurement facility for the study of thin-film superconductors.He became a senior research scientist at the laboratory and  beginning in 1980  was the leader of its thin-film superconductivity group. When the National Magnet Laboratory was moved to Florida he found funding from government sources to support the research group until he retired in 1994. He continued to work as a visiting scientist at MIT for nearly two more decades. Jagadeesh Moodera  a senior research scientist in the Department of Physics at MIT  described Meservey as having “a profound curiosity for the latest in science.”In 2009  Meservey and three colleagues  including two other MIT scientists  received the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize — the highest award given by the American Physical Society — for “pioneering work in the field of spin-dependent tunneling and for the application of these phenomena to the field of magnetoelectronics.” Meservey was the author of more than 100 research articles and supervised several PhD students and postdocs. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and a fellow of the American Physical Society.His discovery of electron spin-polarized tunneling in 1970  with Paul Tedrow of MIT  demonstrated for the first time that electron spin could carry information in an electrical current  and that that information could be detected by superconducting or magnetic devices called tunnel junctions  making new designs of electronic circuits  such as magnetic memories  appear possible. The research  mainly at low temperatures  with superfluid helium  superconductivity and magnetism led to the discovery of the magnetic-field splitting of the quasiparticle states in superconducting aluminum. This provided a way to obtain a pure tunnel current of either spin direction to probe the spin density of states of other metals near the Fermi energy. Results include measurements of the spin polarization of many three-dimensional ferromagnetic metals and the heavy rare-earth metals and studies of the effect of spin-orbit scattering and other theoretical predictions.In 1995  working with Moodera  Meservey participated in the discovery of large magneto-resistance in ferromagnetic-ferromagnetic tunnel junctions at room temperature  a breakthrough which has enabled the development of the current generation of computers with extreme high-density drives and of nonvolatile magnetic memory and logic devices  thus spawning spintronics  one of the most dynamic fields in condensed-matter physics today.In a totally unrelated field of endeavor  Meservey’s wide-ranging intellectual curiosity led him to investigate plate tectonics in the days before it had become accepted dogma. He made detailed maps of continental-shelf boundaries and published papers supporting the concept of continental drift.Meservey was born in Hanover  N.H.  in 1921. At Dartmouth  he was captain of the ski team and won the Eastern Slalom Championship during the winter of 1941-42.  Upon graduating  he volunteered for the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division  serving as a corporal instructor in skiing  rock climbing and winter survival. Awarded the Soldier’s Medal for saving the lives of two soldiers during maneuvers in West Virginia  he was sent to Engineer Officer Candidate School (OCS) at Ft. Belvoir  Va. From 1944 to 1946  as an Army Engineer officer  second lieutenant  he volunteered for duty in the Pacific Theatre  delivering night vision equipment  but was assigned to developing heat-sensing equipment at the Engineer Research and Development Laboratory (ERDL) until discharged in 1946.After the war  Meservey pursued a career as an independent photographer for several years  photographing several famous people  including Robert Frost and John F. Kennedy. He completed a series of photographs of Dartmouth College and did fashion and architectural photography in New York City and Newport  R.I making many illustrations forArchitectural Heritage of Newport Rhode Island  published in 1952. His most well-known photograph was of Jacqueline Bouvier  later Jacqueline Kennedy  descending the stairs at her coming-out party  which appeared on magazine covers when John F. Kennedy became president and was used in many later books.During the Korean War  he worked as a physicist in the development of night vision equipment at the ERDL and later  during graduate school  as a consultant for Perkin-Elmer Co. He was married to Evelyn Bradford Miller of Arlington  Va.  in 1953.Meservey is survived by Evelyn  his wife of 60 years; their two married daughters  Diana Meservey of Piedmont  Calif. and Cambridge  Mass. and Sarah Meservey of Arlington  Va.; and four grandchildren. A funeral service will be held on July 14.

Longtime biology professor Annamaria Torriani-Gorini dies at 94,Annamaria Torriani-Gorini  professor emerita of biology at MIT  died May 2 at her home in Brookline  Mass. She was 94.“Her life journey took her across continents and cultures ” her son  Daniel Gorini  says. “During those years she touched many people with her unwavering self-confidence  her blunt direct manner and her generous heart.”Torriani-Gorini’s education allowed her to forge a path in science that was rare for Italian women of her generation  her son says: She received a PhD in botany from the University of Milan in 1942  and from then until 1948 was a research associate at the Giulio Ronzoni Istituto Chimica e Biochimica in Milan.This was followed by eight years at the Institut Pasteur in Paris  including six years on the faculty  from 1950 to 1956; there  she worked with Melvin Cohn and Jacques Monod  who would go on to win the 1965 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. In 1956  Torriani-Gorini won a Fulbright postdoctoral fellowship  which allowed her to spend two years in the Department of Microbiology at New York University School of Medicine. In 1958  she moved to the Boston area  and Harvard University  where she was a research associate in the departments of biology and biochemistry.Torriani-Gorini’s long affiliation with MIT began in 1960 with a job as a research associate in the Department of Biology. From 1962 to 1972  her work at MIT was supported by a Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health. She earned tenure and became an associate professor of biology in 1971  and was promoted to full professor in 1976.At MIT  Torriani-Gorini’s research interests were in the area of bacterial physiology. Her work with bacterial alkaline phosphatase is often cited as a model for studies of the regulation of enzyme synthesis. She also made significant contributions to teaching undergraduates in her popular introductory laboratory course in the Department of Biology  and by mentoring students in her laboratory.Torriani-Gorini’s service to MIT included the Undergraduate Advising Committee from 1970 to 1973  the Wellesley-MIT Exchange Program from 1974 to 1978  and the Women’s Advisory Committee in 1975. She was a member of MIT’s Committee of the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects from 1980 to 1988.Torriani-Gorini became professor emerita upon her retirement from MIT in 1989. In 1990  she won a Fulbright scholarship to teach and conduct research on the control of macromolecular synthesis at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad  India. She became an honorary member of the French Society of Microbiology in 1993.A love of science  an abhorrence of repressionTorriani-Gorini was born Dec. 19  1918  in Milan  shortly after the infamous Spanish flu of that year claimed the life of her 10-year-old brother. She grew up in Milan with her sister  who was born two years later  and her parents  Ada Forti and Carlo Torriani  a silk merchant descended from a line of nobility that had fallen from financial grace.During the early 1940s  while working in the laboratory in Milan  she met Luigi Gorini  who became her husband. The two were drawn together not only by their love of each other  but also by a shared love of science and an abhorrence of fascism and political repression. They lived in Paris for a decade while both worked as researchers at institutes in the city before moving to the United States in 1956.Daniel Gorini recalls the family home in Brookline as “a focus for scientists  artists and others from all around the world. At holidays  such as Thanksgiving or New Year’s Eve  the house was a haven for an eclectic mix of friends  students and collaborators who found themselves far from their homes. Lively discussion of social and political issues was the norm at these gatherings.”Gorini adds that his parents shared a lifelong belief in social and economic justice. “Where repression  inequality or military aggression occurred  Annamaria and Luigi would be ready to speak out in protest ” he says.A need to aid othersDuring the rise of fascism in 1930s Italy  Luigi Gorini was a member of the Socialist party  and involved with the resistance movement. With the liberation of Milan at the end of World War II  the Socialist party turned over to him a large house in the village of Selvino  in the Italian Alps  that had served as a boarding school for fascist youth. Recognizing the critical need to care for Jewish orphans  liberated from concentration camps  who were then drifting into northern Italy  the Gorinis were instrumental in transforming the house into a home to rehabilitate these children and to prepare them for eventual emigration to Palestine.“They did this irrespective of ideology and without regard to religion ” Daniel Gorini says. “For them it was simply imperative to aid people that had been horribly oppressed during the fascist years.”When Torriani-Gorini and her husband came to the United States in 1956  they continued their activism. “The Cold War was in full swing  and anticommunism was fostering U.S. support of repressive  right-wing governments in Southeast Asia  the Americas and Africa ” their son says. “From their position as established members of a global scientific community  Annamaria and Luigi spoke out  writing letters to newspapers  including their political views in lectures  and taking part in the public protests of the 1960s and ’70s. Both took U.S. citizenship in the early 1960s  but they gave no quarter to their new homeland when they felt it had acted in repressive  imperialist fashion.”While at MIT  Torriani-Gorini was also a supporter of efforts to demand equal treatment of women in science. Throughout her life  she continued to make charitable contributions to causes such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Citizens for Participation in Political Action  and in support of American Indians and Nepalese children.From her youth  Torriani-Gorini loved mountains and traveled extensively  taking every opportunity to visit different places and cultures. After her husband’s death in 1976  Torriani-Gorini began trekking in Nepal  often organizing a small group of friends and colleagues to accompany her. She made her last 30-day trek to the Annapurna Sanctuary at age 78  hiking at altitudes well over 12 000 feet.Torriani-Gorini is survived by her son; her daughter-in-law  Radhika Bagai; her sister  Clara Cattoretti; and by two grandchildren  Marco Gorini and Nika Gorini.
MIT visiting scientist Kanako Miura  36  dies while bicycling in Boston,On Sunday  May 19  MIT visiting scientist Dr. Kanako Miura  36  died after being struck by a motor vehicle while riding her bicycle in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood.Miura  an expert in humanoid robotics  came to MIT last fall during a yearlong sabbatical from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan  where she worked as a senior researcher at the Intelligent Systems Research Institute. At MIT  she worked with Professor Russ Tedrake’s Robot Locomotion Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).In an email sent to the MIT community on May 19  MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote  “Our hearts go out to her friends and colleagues at MIT  and especially the Miura family  who must absorb this terrible loss from so far away.”A native of Japan  Miura received her B.E. in aerospace engineering and her M.E. and Ph.D. in information science from Tohoku University in Japan. She also received a Ph.D. in Electronique  Electrotechnique  Automatique from l'Universite Louis Pasteur  France in 2004. She was a postdoctoral fellow with Tohoku University from 2004-05  and a researcher with NTT DoCoMo (Japan’s largest mobile service provider) from 2005 to 2007. In 2007  she joined the Intelligent Systems Research Institute at the AIST where she worked on the HRP-4C  or Miim robot  a humanoid robot designed to mimic the features of a human female.“I am shocked and saddened by this tragic loss  and my heart goes out to Dr. Miura’s friends and colleagues in the Robot Locomotion Group and  most importantly  to her family ” said Professor Daniela Rus  director of CSAIL. “Dr. Miura’s research in humanoid robotics was essential to the field  and she made many important contributions during her time at MIT. She truly became an integral part of the CSAIL community during her time here and her loss will be felt by all.”Miura’s research focused on human motion analysis and motion generation for humanoid robots in particular. For Tedrake and his research group the opportunity to learn from Miura about her approach to walking  planning and control for humanoid robots was an unparalleled chance to gain insight and knowledge from one of the experts in the field of humanoid robotics. Tedrake and his team were excited to apply Miura's experience to the techniques his group has developed in the realm of dynamics and motion control.“We learned so much from her from the time she arrived  not only about her specific approach to humanoids  but also about the field of humanoid robots in general. As we were trying to enter this new field of humanoid robotics  she was our expert ” Tedrake said.With the Robot Locomotion Group  Miura conducted research using the language of optimization for control design used in Tedrake’s group to reinterpret the successful results Miura had had in her work at the AIST in Japan. Through their collaborative efforts  Miura and Tedrake hoped to come up with new  state-of-the-art techniques for walking and motion control in humanoid robots.The timing of Miura’s arrival at MIT was serendipitous  according to Tedrake  as his research group was just starting a new research project with the group’s first humanoid  a robot named HUBO.During her time at CSAIL  Miura became an essential part of the Robot Locomotion Group  both for her technical expertise and for the warmth  care and friendship she provided to all her colleagues. Tedrake recalled how Miura was an enthusiastic participant in the group runs his research group frequently takes  hosted one of the Robot Locomotion Group parties at her apartment and even became one of the leaders of the team’s group coffee breaks. During Robot Day at the Cambridge Science Festival  Miura spent hours explaining the technology behind humanoid robots to crowds of young children.“She was really part of the fabric of our group. She was not just a visitor in our group  she became a close friend and a member of our family ” said Tedrake. “The energy she brought to her work was contagious  and her enthusiasm was easy to see. She loved giving tours  and showing off the lab  and she had an unfailing optimism in the future and importance of humanoid robots.”Mark Pearrow  a software engineer in the Robot Locomotion Group  worked closely with Miura on integrating her knowledge of bipedal locomotion into Tedrake’s research group's software and getting it to run on HUBO. “She was bright  patient  very giving of her time and knowledge  humble and funny. It was an honor to be able to work with her and I will miss her terribly ” Pearrow said. “I just hope we can find the wisdom and strength to carry her spirit forward in our lives and work.”All members of the MIT community who feel affected by this death are encouraged to contactMental Health Servicesat 617-253-2916.This article will be updated with information about plans to honor Miura’s memory as details become available.
Mechanical engineering professor Joseph LeConte Smith Jr. dies at 83,Joseph LeConte Smith Jr.  the Samuel C. Collins Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering  died on May 7 at the age of 83.After completing his undergraduate education in mechanical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology  Smith served in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army before beginning his graduate work at MIT in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics under the late Joseph H. Keenan. Starting as an instructor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1956  he rose through the academic ranks to become Ford Professor of Engineering in 1991. In 1994  he was the first faculty member to hold the Samuel P. Collins Senior Faculty Chair  named after the founder of the MIT Cryogenic Engineering Laboratory  which Smith directed from 1964 until his retirement in 2008.Smith was a consummate mechanical engineer who made innovative contributions to both education and research. In 1967  he introduced an innovative approach to undergraduate education in thermodynamics that prevails to this day. In graduate thermodynamics  he brought the thermodynamics subject introduced by Keenan  his mentor  into the 21st century.In collaboration with Ernest Cravalho  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering and of health science and technology  he developed the textbookEngineering Thermodynamics. Along with Cravalho  professor of mechanical engineering John Brisson  and Gareth McKinley  the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation  he wrote the comprehensive course notes for the mechanical engineering core courses on thermal fluids that integrate the subject areas of thermodynamics  fluid mechanics and heat transfer.In the MIT tradition ofmens et manus(mind and hand)  Smith was famous for his hands-on approach to engineering. He viewed the world as a problem in engineering design — so much so that when asked why any given natural phenomenon took the form found in nature  his standard reply was  “Because that’s the way I would build it.”In the lab  this hands-on approach earned him the respect and admiration of the many students who worked with him over the years: He shared with them his rare ability to translate new ideas into engineering prototypes. His graduate students not only explored new ideas in theory  but they also built working hardware to test these ideas. In a recent cryogenics symposium held in his honor  many of Smith’s former graduate students acknowledged the important role he played in their own careers.Smith’s research spanned fundamental areas of thermodynamics  heat transfer  electromagnetics and cryogenics  and he was able to integrate these diverse fields to advance the practice of engineering. His success in this process was perhaps best manifested in his work with Gerald Wilson  the Vannevar Bush Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering  on the development of a superconducting generator. In recognition of his many contributions to the practice of mechanical engineering  Smith was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering.A memorial service will be held on June 1 at 2 p.m.  at Trinity Episcopal Church  81 Elm St.  Concord  Mass. His family will host visiting hours at the Concord Funeral Home  74 Belknap St.  Concord  Mass.  on Friday  May 31  from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Emily Wick PhD '51  MIT's first female professor to earn tenure  dies at 91,Emily Wick  the first female faculty member to earn tenure at MIT  died peacefully in her home in Rockport  Mass.  on March 21  2013. She was 91.Wick was born on Dec. 9  1921  in Youngstown  Ohio. She attended Mount Holyoke College where she earned her BS in chemistry and her MA in organic chemistry. In 1946  Emily joined the MIT community as a PhD candidate in the chemistry department. She received her degree in 1951.After working several years for A.D. Little  Wick returned to MIT as assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Science in 1959. In 1963 she became the first woman to reach the rank of tenured faculty at the Institute  and she was appointed associate dean of students in 1965.Wick made numerous contributions to the MIT community. Together with Professor Mildred Dresselhaus  she established the Women’s Forum  which convened faculty  staff  undergraduates and graduate students to discuss issues from women’s health to career opportunities. She was an active advocate for female students and assisted them in navigating the predominantly male environment of the day. She was also instrumental in eliminating gender considerations from the Institute’s admissions criteria and ensuring that female students  faculty and staff had an equal voice and role on MIT’s campus.In 1973  she returned to her alma mater  Mount Holyoke  where she served as dean of the faculty and later as special assistant to the president for long-range planning. She maintained her ties to MIT  however  by serving as an alumni term member of the MIT Corporation from 1978 to 1983. She retired in 1986 and returned to her home in Rockport.Wick was also an avid sailor. From the age of 10 until very recently she spent much of her free time on the water. Over the course of her life  she was the skipper of a Star Boat  a Jolly Boat  a Firefly and finally a Bullseye. She was the first woman commodore of the Sandy Bay Yacht Club in Rockport. She was also influential in the development of the women’s varsity sailing team at MIT  which began in 1969 when the athletic department funded a coaching position dedicated to women sailors — the first in the country. In recognition of her work  MIT alumnae organized the Emily Wick Regatta  held annually  and the Emily L. Wick trophy eventually became the Intercollegiate Women's Sailing Championship trophy. Wick’s life and contributions were honored during a moment of reflection at this year’s regatta held earlier this month.Wick is survived by her nephew  Jim Wick  of Shelburne  Vt.; and four nieces  Laura Hallowell of Rockport and her two children  Susanne and Stephen; Louise (Dan) DeSantis of Somersworth  N.H.  and her children  Peter and Madeline; Emily W. Schaff of Youngstown  Ohio; and Anne Schaff of Portland  Maine. Memorial contributions may be made to the Sandy Bay Yacht Club Sailing Program and Scholarship Fund Inc.  or to Hospice of the North Shore.
‘He loved us  and we loved him’,MIT has identified the police officer killed in the line of duty on Thursday evening as Patrol Officer Sean A. Collier  27  of Somerville  Mass.Collier had served as a member of the MIT Police since Jan. 9  2012  following service as a civilian employee with the Somerville Police Department. He was single and a native of Wilmington  Mass.“Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling ” said MIT Police Chief John DiFava. “He was born to be a police officer.”Collier was shot Thursday evening following an altercation at the corner of Vassar Street and Main Street in Cambridge  roughly between Building 32 (Stata Center) and Building 76 (David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research) on the MIT campus. He was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital  where he was pronounced dead.The MIT Police  Cambridge Police Department and Massachusetts State Police are continuing their investigation of the circumstances surrounding Collier’s death.“The loss of Officer Collier is deeply painful to the entire MIT community ” MIT President L. Rafael Reif said. “Our thoughts today are with his family  his friends  his colleagues on our police force and  by all accounts  the many other members of our community who knew him. This is a senseless and tragic loss.”“The MIT Police serve all of us at the Institute with great dignity  honor and dedication ” said Israel Ruiz  MIT’s executive vice president and treasurer. “Everyone here — those who knew Officer Collier  and those who did not — are devastated by the events that transpired on our campus last night. We will never forget the seriousness with which he took his role protecting MIT and those of us who consider it home.”‘He loved us  and we loved him’DiFava said Collier was highly involved with MIT’s student population. “In a very short period of time  it was remarkable how engaged he was with students ” DiFava said.“He wanted to get to know students — he wanted to understand us ” senior Michele Pratusevich said. “And he did it; he knew which students he was protecting every day when he came to work. By getting to know students  by talking to us  by sharing memories with us  by hiking with us  by dancing with us  by listening to music with us  he knew his community. He loved us  and we loved him.”Maddie Hickman ’11 recalled Collier’s frequent stops by MIT’s student center while on his shift — and his dancing of the Lindy Hop.“At first  some of the dancers were nervous at the ‘police presence’ in the room  but Sean made friends quickly ” she said. “In the spirit of trying new things  he even started taking swing-dancing lessons in his time off  so he could participate in future dances ‘without being embarrassed ’ as he said.”‘He truly was an asset to our campus’Dozens of other students and alumni who met Collier in his 15 months at MIT described him as “dedicated ” “cheerful ” “personable ” “charming” and “kind.” Many encountered him through his involvement with MIT-EMS  the Institute’s ambulance service — which transported the wounded officer to Massachusetts General Hospital last evening.“Many on campus knew him because he was just so friendly ” junior Max Tang recalled. “I had known of him for many months before having the pleasure of meeting him. … He was always smiling  always had a funny story to tell  and he would always remember what I was up to last time we spoke and would ask about it. … He truly was an asset to our campus.”“He inherently cared about this campus  and the people in this community ” Lawrence Wong  a graduate student in aerospace engineering  said. Sophomore David Hou described Collier as “a friendly and down-to-earth kind of guy that you would want to be friends with.”The young officer  MIT senior Noel Morales said  was a regular presence at student events — and one who would always introduce himself to students  ask their names  and crack jokes. “He was always really fun to hang out with ” Morales said.‘A joy to be around’Even students who had only just met Collier felt drawn to him.“I met Sean just a week ago ” sophomore Jennifer Plotkin said. “After the events at the Marathon on Monday  Sean Facebook-messaged me to tell me that he was glad I was OK. … He was extremely kind  caring and a joy to be around.”“In the short time I knew him it was obvious that Sean cared deeply about his job  his friends and family  and anyone around him  even if he had just met them ” MIT-EMS member Kat Goldsmith said. “He assisted and protected me even before he knew my name  even going out of his way to follow my all-female squad on calls (even when he knew we could take care of ourselves). That was just the kind of person he was — quick to go out of his way to help others  make a joke and smile.”‘Never seen a star rise as fast’Collier was also active with the MIT Outing Club (MITOC)  joining students in hiking — especially winter hiking.“During one hike  we tried to make it ‘retro-MITOC-themed ’ including yodeling ” Pratusevich recalled. “Sean claimed he wasn’t much of a singer  but was one of the first to try his hand at the elusive art of yodeling. Hearing his deep voice crack over those yodels definitely made that hike (we didn't reach the top) one of the more fun hikes I’ve been on. He was eager to strut his plaid flannel  yodel off the sides of a mountain  enjoy eating his chocolate and pepperoni  and be happy and cheerful even with our exceedingly slow pace.”Others were amazed by Collier’s rapid embrace of winter hiking in New Hampshire’s White Mountains — home to some of the nation’s most brutal weather.“Sean was a MITOC all-star ” mechanical engineering graduate student Matthew Gilbertson ’08 said. “In my nine years with MITOC  I have never seen a star rise as fast as Sean’s.”‘An altruist’s heart’“The thing that impressed me about Sean was how enthusiastically he took the plunge into winter hiking  how quickly he mastered it  and how rapidly he made friends ” Gilbertson added. “Sean’s first big winter hike was in January  and just a few weeks later  he was already climbing Mount Washington in winter — one of the toughest outdoor feats in the eastern United States.”“He was the kind of person who would willingly offer help  even at inconvenience to himself  without having to be asked ” MITOC member Andrew Ding added. “It’s easy to understand why he became a police officer. He gave me the strong impression he had an altruist’s heart.”Ding said that a few months ago  he and Collier were involved in a car accident while driving to the White Mountains for a MITOC trip. “Sean was the first out of our car to go check and see if the [other driver] was OK ” Ding said. “It would be exceedingly difficult to imagine him not stepping up and doing the right thing when he had the chance  which unfortunately he did last night.”Collier’s family has requested that gifts in his memory go toThe Jimmy Fund. MIT has created aSean A. Collier Memorial Fundthat will support a Collier Medal — to be awarded to individuals who demonstrate Collier’s values — and other causes.
Professor emeritus Harold Wachman dies at 85,Retired Aeronautics and Astronautics Department Professor Harold Y. Wachman of Lexington  Mass.  passed away on March 25. He was 85.Wachman taught thermodynamics to generations of Course 16 Unified Engineering (16.01-16.04) students. He also taught freshman physics and graduate classes in rarefied gas dynamics.Wachman’s research focused on low-density gas behavior  low gravity combustion and ice nucleation  investigated ice crystal formation in a vacuum  and combustion in the absence of gravity. Among his research interests was the exploration of the dynamics of molecular scattering at surfaces of solids. Several experiments inspired by his laboratory research were conducted aboard Space Shuttle missions.Wachman was born on Dec. 2  1927 in Tel Aviv. In 1940  he immigrated to Brooklyn  N.Y. Following his graduation from City College of New York  he was drafted into the Army and stationed at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. There  he worked on the development of a civilian nerve gas detector.Once discharged from the Army  Wachman moved to Columbia  Mo.  where he earned his Ph.D. in photochemistry at the University of Missouri. In 1956  Wachman joined General Electric’s Space Sciences Laboratory in Pennsylvania  where he researched molecular collisions responsible for satellite drag and orbital decay. In 1962  he was recruited to the AeroAstro Department faculty by Charles Stark “Doc” Draper  where he served until his retirement in 1996.“Though research and teaching were his passion  when serving on the MIT committees on academic performance  and graduate school policy  and in his long tenure as AeroAstro’s graduate program chairman  my father worked passionately to maintain and defend MIT’s environment of academic excellence from those who would unwittingly or intentionally hamper it with  what was in his view  unnecessary bureaucracy ” says Joshua Wachman (SB ’90  SM ’96).“Well-respected for an uncommon wisdom and well-regarded for his rare wit  my father was an intellect nurtured by curiosity and guided by a strong moral code " Wachman adds. "Friends and colleagues knew him as an engaging conversationalist always ready to share a good glass of wine and an entertaining anecdote filled with a telltale blend of humor and morality.”Harold Wachman is survived by his wife of 58 years  Barbara  and sons Joel (SM ’90) and Joshua. He was also father of the late Tufts University Fletcher School Professor Alan M. Wachman.
Professor emeritus Frederick J. McGarry dies at 86,Frederick J. McGarry  professor emeritus of polymer engineering in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) died March 27 after a long illness. He was 86.McGarry was associated with MIT for 52 years  first coming to the Institute as a student in a joint undergraduate degree program with Middlebury College. In 1950  he earned an AB in physics and math from Middlebury and an SB in mechanical engineering from MIT. He then received an SM in mechanical engineering/materials from MIT in 1953.Prof. McGarry’s first appointment at MIT was in the Materials of Construction Division in CEE  and he joined DMSE in 1975  as a direct result of MIT’s concentrating and strengthening its efforts in polymer education and research. He taught many subjects over the years  notably in polymer engineering  behavior of plastics and fracture of materials.Throughout his career  he had many research collaborations inside and outside MIT  including with colleagues at Dow Corning  Dow Chemical  Monsanto  American Cyanamid and BF Goodrich. His research centered on polymer engineering  including fiber-reinforced composites. Of his many pioneering contributions in this field  perhaps the most notable was the development of rubber toughening in thermosetting resins  a vital part of modern composites technology.In addition to his research and education roles  McGarry served as secretary of the faculty  director of the Program in Polymer Science and Technology  chair of the ROTC program  and director of the Summer Session (now the Professional Education Program). Over the course of his career  he participated in multiple international programs  including in the 1960s the MIT Inter-American Program in Civil Engineering  which examined a collaborative initiative to solve engineering problems common to the United States and Latin American countries.McGarry  who was born and raised in Vermont  lived for many years in Weston  Mass. He was widowed in 1971 when his wife and the mother of their six daughters  Alice R. McGarry  passed away. The couple had met and married when she was a graduate student at Harvard.He leaves his longtime partner  Norma Webb; his six daughters  Martha McGarry Miller of New York City  Alice Aldridge of Weston  Mass.

Robert Bishop  MIT economist and dean  dies at age 96,Robert Bishop  a microeconomic theorist and innovative teacher who served as head of MIT’s Department of Economics and as dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences  died on Thursday  Feb. 7  at his home in Cambridge. He was 96  and had been affiliated with MIT continuously since 1942.“Bob was a terrific colleague and exceedingly sharp ” said Robert M. Solow  professor emeritus of economics at MIT  who first met Bishop in the 1940s. “He was a marvelous teacher  very precise  very careful  and very detailed.”As a researcher  Bishop published papers on a range of topics  including game theory and public finance. As a teacher  he was known for  among other things  the “Bishop notes” — a detailed set of notes on course 14.121  a graduate-level introduction to microeconomic theory  which became an essential resource for PhD students over many years.Whether in his research  teaching  or critiques of colleagues’ work  Solow said  Bishop “was a devotee of what is in many ways the MIT style  using as few bells and whistles as possible  deciding what the main point is ” and carefully homing in on that.As an active presence in MIT economics from its early days as a little-noticed “service department” through its growth into a prominent department fully invested in teaching  research and the training of PhD students  Bishop played a key role in “that evolution of the powerhouse that the department has become ” said Richard Williams  one of Bishop’s nephews  who helped care for Bishop in recent years.Robert Bishop was born in St. Louis on June 4  1916  to Lyle A. Bishop and Helen Craden Bishop. The family soon moved to New York  where Bishop graduated from Manhasset High School on Long Island. He graduatedsumma cum laudefrom Harvard University in 1937. After a year in graduate school at Princeton University  the economist John Kenneth Galbraith urged Bishop to return to Harvard  where Bishop received an M.A. in economics. Bishop joined MIT’s economics department in 1942  and received his PhD from Harvard in 1949.As a graduate student at Harvard  Bishop met his wife  Joan Fiss  who had already acquired an M.A. from Radcliffe College  in 1935  and a degree in business administration from Harvard  in 1938. After marrying  they moved to Wellesley  Mass.  where Joan Bishop worked at Wellesley College; she died in 1981. Bishop lived in Wellesley for 59 years  until moving about six years ago to Cambridge.Bishop’s first significant published article  in theQuarterly Journal of Economics (QJE)in 1943  examined the concept of “consumer’s surplus ” when consumers can buy products for less than their perceived full value. Some of Bishop’s additional research contributions include a pair of papers on bargaining theory — one published in the QJE in 1963  and one published in Econometrica the following year. He also published a 1968 paper in the QJE on the different effects of specific taxes (those based on the quantity of a good purchased) and ad valorem taxes (those based on value  such as property taxes).Bishop was also co-editor  with Paul A. Samuelson and J.R. Coleman  of the volume “Readings in Economics ” first published in 1952.Bishop served as head of MIT’s Department of Economics from 1958 until 1965  and was the second dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences — then known as the School of Humanities and Social Science — from 1964 until 1973. He helped oversee the reorganization of the school at a time when it was expanding its programs. Bishop remained a professor at MIT until retiring in 1986; he was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.According to Solow  Bishop was highly sociable  friendly with colleagues  and generous in listening to his colleagues discuss their research  often offering useful thoughts about their work.“He was very quick with pointed questions about what was important about it  and what was weakest ” Solow said. Bishop’s devotion to teaching  and to supporting his colleagues  “is part of what makes a department a department ” Solow added.Bishop was an ardent fan of musical theater  and opera more specifically  with an encyclopedic knowledge of scores  lyrics  performers and productions. He would sometimes entertain friends with renditions of arias  and accumulated a substantial collection of annotated playbills from the shows he had seen.“He could quote a song from Gilbert and Sullivan you’d never heard of ” Solow recalled. Bishop also loved telling stories about the history of opera and musical theater.“He was a raconteur in his own way ” said Williams  his nephew. “Above all  he was a polymath. He knew a lot about a lot of things.”Bishop is survived by his sister  Betty Williams of Indianapolis  and seven nieces and nephews: Helen Williams Hill of Santa Monica  Calif.; Roberton C. Williams of Alexandria  Va.; Richard Bishop Williams of Somerville  Mass.; David Lyle Williams of Zionsville  Ind.; Thomas H. Bishop of New York; Robert C. Bishop of Lexington  Mass.; and Katherine Bishop Kilmurray of Arlington  Mass. A memorial service is being planned for spring 2013.
Nevin S. Scrimshaw  pioneer in nutrition research  dies at 95,Institute Professor emeritus Nevin S. Scrimshaw  who founded MIT’s former Department of Nutrition and Food Science  died in Plymouth  N.H.  on Friday  Feb. 8. He was 95 and died of congestive heart failure.Scrimshaw dedicated his career of almost seven decades to the alleviation of hunger and malnutrition. His work substantially improved the lives of millions of people around the globe — efforts for which he was recognized with the 1991 World Food Prize. The prize committee cited Scrimshaw “for his revolutionary accomplishments over six decades  in fighting protein  iodide  and iron deficiencies  developing nutritional supplements  educating generations of experts  and building support for continued advances in food quality around the world.”Scrimshaw came to MIT in 1961 as a professor of human nutrition. In 1974 he was selected for the Institute’s first James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award  and in 1976 he was appointed as an Institute Professor  a distinguished rank reserved for MIT scholars of special accomplishment. He retired from MIT in 1988.Scrimshaw was the founder and honorary president of the Nevin Scrimshaw International Nutrition Foundation and founder of the World Hunger Program of the United Nations University. He also served as a visiting professor in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.Nevin Stewart Scrimshaw was born Jan. 20  1918  in Milwaukee  where his father  Stewart Scrimshaw  was a professor of economics at Marquette University. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1941  and his MD from the University of Rochester in 1945.He married Mary W. Goodrich  a biologist and nutritional anthropologist  in 1941; she worked closely with him throughout his career. The family  including five children  lived for many years in Guatemala  where Scrimshaw was the founding director of the Institute of Nutrition of Central American and Panama (INCAP). He led the early development of this institution from 1949 to 1961.In the 1950s  in association with INCAP  Scrimshaw developed solutions for kwashiorkor  a deadly disease that strikes young children. Recognizing from studies at INCAP and elsewhere that the problem was one of protein deficiency  Scrimshaw searched for an affordable  indigenous protein source.Using a mixture of cottonseed flour and maize  he developed Incaparina  which today is given to 80 percent of Guatemalan infants to combat protein deficiency. Later  during a 1967 famine in India  Scrimshaw guided the development of a similar food  Balahar  based on peanut flour and wheat. His approach to such nutritional supplements remains the basis for locally produced  lower-cost foods to prevent malnutrition in many developing countries. Scrimshaw also created extensive training programs in food and nutrition that have benefited more than 500 scientists from developing countries  helping those nations become more self-sufficient nutritionally.While at INCAP  Scrimshaw also focused his attention on endemic goiter. He developed a method of iodizing a moist local salt with nonsoluble potassium iodate  reducing goiter prevalence in mothers and children both in Guatemala and worldwide. These results prompted Scrimshaw to work with various governments to require iodization of all salt for human consumption  alleviating endemic goiters in many countries throughout the world.In the 1960s  Scrimshaw conducted pioneering work on the relationship between nutrition and infection — laying the foundation for much of today’s research on nutrition and infectious disease. He later initiated the World Hunger Program of the United Nations University in 1975  directing it and its successor  the Food and Nutrition Program for Human and Social Development  for the next two decades. He continued to advise the program and edit its publications for many years.In 1982  Scrimshaw founded the Boston-based International Nutrition Foundation. The foundation  which awards fellowships and supports research projects around the world  aims “to build capacity in developing-country individuals and institutions in the areas of nutrition research  policy and programming so they can effectively address issues of food  nutrition and hunger in their countries.”Scrimshaw said that during his decades on the MIT faculty  the Department of Nutrition and Food Science came to “serve as a model for other departments around the U.S. and the world ” with its graduates going on to serve as leaders of major international nutrition organizations and national institutes. “I’m grateful for the tremendous amount of support I received from MIT all those years ” he said in a 2008 interview. “For me  it was a very happy and productive time.”Robert Langer  an Institute Professor who was recruited to the MIT faculty by Scrimshaw  says  “He was a great man and  in my opinion  he had a great life. He gave me my start at MIT  and he touched the lives of so many people. The world is a far better place for all that he did.”Institute Professor emerita Mildred Dresselhaus says Scrimshaw was “an MIT icon regarding nutrition  and a professor who [made] MIT the place that it is.”Scrimshaw wrote or edited more than 20 books and 650 papers on nutrition  food science and public health. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the National Academy of Sciences  and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies  where he and his daughter  Susan C. Scrimshaw — a public-health specialist who is now president of the Sage Colleges in Troy  N.Y. — became the first father-and-daughter members. His dozens of awards and honors included the designation “Hero of Public Health” by President Vicente Fox of Mexico; a knighthood from the King of Thailand; naming to the Order of Rodolfo Robles by the government of Guatemala; the Bolton L. Corson Medal from the Franklin Institute; and seven honorary doctorates.Scrimshaw grew lilies  fruit and vegetables on his northern New Hampshire farm  and loved travel  visiting well over 100 countries in the course of his career. He used his knowledge of nutrition to create a regime of diet and exercise that he credited with helping to sustain his own good health. He maintained his longstanding love of hiking and downhill skiing well into his 90s  often in the company of some of his five children and eight grandchildren. Family members said that anyone riding a ski lift with him stood a good chance of learning more than they wished to know about their nutritional status and eating habits.Scrimshaw lived for years in the White Mountains of New Hampshire with Mary  his wife of 71 years  who survives him. He is also survived by his five children — Susan C. Scrimshaw  Norman S. Scrimshaw  Nevin B. Scrimshaw  Steven W. Scrimshaw and Nathaniel L. Scrimshaw — as well as by eight grandchildren  two step-grandchildren  and one great-grandchild. He was predeceased by his brother  Norman G. Scrimshaw  who was killed in action in France in 1944  during World War II.A memorial service will be held in the Boston area on Saturday  April 20; contactIrwin Rosenbergfor further information. A second service will be held in Plymouth  N.H.  at a date still to be determined. The family requests that donations be made either to theNevin Scrimshaw International Nutrition Foundation  or to theInstitute for Tropical Ecology and Conservation.
Pioneering applied mathematician Chia-Chiao Lin dies at 96,Chia-Chiao Lin  an Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT who played a pivotal role in the development of applied mathematics both in the United States and in China  died Sunday in Beijing.He was 96. The cause of death was heart failure  Lin’s family said.Lin’s broad and seminal research  together with his service to the community  were instrumental in the growth of applied mathematics at MIT and elsewhere in the United States. More recently  he had helped build the field in China as a Distinguished Professor at Tsinghua University since 2002.Lin joined MIT as an associate professor of applied mathematics in 1947  becoming a full professor in 1953. In 1966  he was named an Institute Professor — MIT’s most prestigious faculty appointment. He retired from MIT in 1987.Real-world applicationsLin was an applied mathematician whose research initially concentrated on fluid mechanics  focusing on hydrodynamics stability and turbulence  and addressing the aerodynamics of gas turbines  oscillating airfoils and shock waves. His doctoral dissertation solved an outstanding problem  stemming from Werner Heisenberg’s work  concerning the stability of parallel flows. He also resolved a long-standing problem concerning the theory of asymptotic solutions of ordinary differential equations (of higher order than 2)  which are uniformly valid around turning points.With Theodore von Kármán  his thesis advisor  Lin proposed a spectral theory for homogeneous turbulence  further developing von Kármán’s similarity theory and the statistical theory of turbulence. These investigations in hydrodynamic stability and turbulence greatly impacted engineering and science fields dealing with fluid flow  including geophysical fluid dynamics. In 1955  Lin published a monograph titled “The Theory of Hydrodynamic Stability ” the first such publication in this developing field.Lin’s research interests then turned to problems in the hydrodynamics of superfluid helium and astrophysics. In 1964  in collaboration with Frank Shu of the University of California at Berkeley  Lin advanced the density-wave theory of galaxy formation (based on the earlier work of Bertil Lindblad) to account for sustained spiral structures. He also contributed to related problems in gravitational collapse and star formation.In 1974 Lin co-authored  with his former student L. A. Segel  the now-classic treatise  “Mathematics Applied to Deterministic Problems in the Natural Sciences.” More recently  in 1996  with Giuseppe Bertin  he published another monograph  “Spiral Structure in Galaxies: A Density Wave Theory.”Contributions in ChinaFor many years  Lin was interested in the development of science and education in China. In 1972  as the deputy leader of a delegation of Chinese-born American scientists  Lin returned to his homeland  receiving a warm welcome from Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders. He visited China regularly in the ensuing years  inviting many well-known experts to give lectures there. He also facilitated study and research by Chinese scholars at MIT — many of whom have since become leaders in various fields in China.In 2002  Lin returned to his alma mater  Tsinghua University  as Distinguished Professor. He founded the Zhou Pei-Yuan Center for Applied Mathematics — now an active hub of research in quantitative biology  applied partial differential equations  scientific computation  and other interdisciplinary subjects linking mathematics  natural sciences and engineering — and served as its honorary director  undertaking research on protein folding. He worked tirelessly at Tsinghua University to set an example for young researchers  overseeing the research of more than 10 PhD students.Lin was also a visiting professor of mathematics at Florida State University from 1994 to 2011.A celebrated scholarLin was born July 7  1916  in Beijing. He received a BSc in physics from Tsinghua University in 1937 and an MSc in applied mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1941. He then earned his PhD  in aeronautics  from the California Institute of Technology in 1944; Caltech honored Lin with its Distinguished Alumni Award in 1992.Lin did postdoctoral work at the Jet Propulsion Lab before joining the faculty of Brown University in 1945 as an assistant professor of applied mathematics  becoming an associate professor in 1946. He joined MIT’s mathematics faculty the following year.Twice named a Guggenheim Fellow  in 1954 and 1960  Lin received major recognitions from a variety of professional societies  including the Otto Laporte Award of the American Physical Society. In 1975  he received the Timoshenko Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering “for outstanding contributions to fluid mechanics  especially to hydrodynamic stability and turbulence  superfluid helium  aerodynamics and galactic structures.” He received the Award in Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis from the National Academy of Sciences in 1977 and the first Fluid Dynamic Prize of the American Physical Society in 1979.In 1981  the MIT faculty selected Lin for the James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award; he delivered the Killian Lecture to the MIT community in the spring of 1982. Lin’s Killian Award citation noted that he was highly influential in “developing a more comprehensive approach to applied mathematics.”Within MIT’s Department of Mathematics  Lin served as the first faculty chair of the applied mathematics group  from 1961 to 1966. He was president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics from 1973 to 1974  and a member of its board of trustees from 1978 to 1980.Lin held honorary doctorates from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (1973)  Tsinghua University (1987) and Taiwan’s National Tsing Hua University (2005). He was also  his family said  an honorary professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and at Nankai University. His professional honors included selection as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1951)  as academician of Academia Sinica (1958)  as a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1962)  and as a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1994).Lin was twice a member of the Institute for Advanced Study  in 1959 to 1960 and 1965 to 1966. He was also a member or fellow of the American Astronomical Society  the American Mathematical Society  the American Physical Society  the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  and the Institute of Aerospace Sciences.Lin is survived by his wife of 66 years  Shouying Liang Lin  of Beijing and Cambridge  Mass.; daughter Lillian Shengjung Lin and her husband  Alan Stephen Crawford  of Decatur  Ga.; sister Xiaoyuan Lin and her husband  Shukai Li; sister Xiaoying Lin and her husband  Junjie Gu; and brother-in-law Hongmo Dong. He is also survived by stepgrandson Scott Crawford and his wife  Shay  and their children; stepgrandson Joshua Taylor and his wife  Sarah  and their children; stepgranddaughter Yolanda Jones and her husband  Darius  and their children; and numerous cousins  nephews  nieces  great-nephews  and great-nieces.Lin was preceded in death by his son Edward; brother Jiaxin Lin and his wife  Shunzu Huang; brother Jiatian Lin; brother Jiakeng Lin and his wife  Kanghuai Cheng; sister Xiaohua Lin; brother-in-law Shoupan Liang and his wife  He Fu; brother-in-law Shouchu Liang; and sister-in-law Shoubin Liang and her husband  Xiaoshen Chen.

Those who wish to send flowers to the private funeral service on Saturday  Nov. 3  should emailjmwong@mit.edu.
Nuclear physicist Peter T. Demos dies at 94,Peter T. Demos  a nuclear physicist who guided MIT’s Bates Linear Accelerator from a groundbreaking idea in 1961 to a globally renowned center for the study of nuclear structure and reactions  died of coronary artery disease on Sept. 18. A longtime resident of Belmont  Mass.  Demos was 94.Demos was a “remarkable scientific leader ” said Robert Redwine  a professor of physics at MIT and current director of the Bates Center. “His excellent scientific taste  his unquestioned integrity  and his determination to support every user of the laboratory were critical in establishing a style of operation that was a model for laboratories around the world.”The Bates Accelerator “opened up a huge new area of research in nuclear physics. We pioneered studies in high-resolution electron scattering and started a program in coincidence experiments ” said MIT physics professor Stanley Kowalski  Demos’ former student and faculty colleague. Demos and Kowalski worked with a team of MIT physicists to launch the Bates facility.Demos served as director of the Bates Center from 1973 to 1983. During its more-than-30-year life as an international center for the study of nuclear physics  scientists came from around the world to use the facility in Middleton  Mass.Before developing and directing Bates  Demos served as a leader in the design and construction of MIT’s first microwave linear accelerator  completed in 1951. During the 1960s  he was a trustee to the group of nine universities  including MIT  founded to operate the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s proton accelerator.“Those whose passion is to understand the basic nature of matter and energy are in Peter Demos’ debt ” John M. Deutch  Institute Professor of Chemistry and dean emeritus of the School of Science  noted when Demos retired as Bates director. “He gave us essential leadership — a remarkable national resource for physics research  a tool of inestimable value.”The Bates Center now provides critical technical support for MIT researchers and their collaborators in nuclear and particle physics experiments  and houses the largest MIT facility for high-performance computing. Bates staff members also collaborate on applications of accelerator technology to projects in medical physics and in homeland security.Demos’ legacy was honored when the Peter T. Demos Award was established to recognize a graduate student who demonstrates the “spirit  persistence and intellectual qualities” Demos embodied over his long career.Research and a leapAn expert in radiation and applications of radiation  Demos specialized in ballistics and radar studies before coming to MIT with his young family in 1946 as a research associate. He earned his PhD at the Institute in 1951 and joined the MIT physics faculty in 1957  becoming a full professor and director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science (LNS) in 1961. He served as LNS director until 1973.As director of LNS and Bates  Demos “pushed heaven and earth to get good ideas implemented. His efforts were very important toward having LNS recognized as a world leader in nuclear and particle physics ” said William Bertozzi  a professor of physics at MIT and and Demos’ first graduate student.Demos’ early MIT work  concentrating on low-energy physics and photonuclear reactions  might have set him on a conventionally successful academic career. But he made a classic MIT leap: When an innovative  hands-on project arose — building one of the first linear accelerators  a 17-million-electron-volt machine — Demos twice set aside his doctoral research to get the room-sized device working.At that time there were three accelerators on MIT’s campus — a synchrotron in Building 24  a cyclotron in Building 44 and the linear accelerator  or linac  that Demos and his team built in Building 20. “The linac made possible world-leading research ” Kowalski recalled. “It truly was an exciting time to do physics.”Demos’ example and his generosity helped harness those exciting times at MIT. His support was “crucial to success in experimental research. In his quiet but convincing style he helped open many doors of opportunity and recognition for the faculty and research staff ” Bertozzi said. “I shall miss his advice and counsel.”Not surprisingly  Demos advocated breadth in physics education and flexibility with young physicists as they grew  as he did  through experience. A devoted mentor and educator  he once wrote that while he valued a “good undergraduate physics education and direct experience with good experimental work  I have learned the most from teaching others.”In recent years  Demos was interested in energy issues as well as new techniques for cooling hadron beams at high energies. “He was a wise and regular contributor to informal discussions on energy in LNS in the years 2007 to 2010. With his LNS colleagues  he co-authored an article in theMIT Faculty Newsletteron nuclear energy in 2008 ” noted Richard Milner  the current LNS director and a professor of physics.Demos was a member of the American Physical Society and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a former director of the advisory panel to the Center for Radiation Physics Division at the National Bureau of Standards. He also served as chair of the Committee on Radiation of the National Research Council.A native of Toronto  Demos became a U.S. citizen in 1958. His wife of 62 years  Elizabeth (Betty) Jean  died in 2003. He is survived by his sons  Theodore of California and John of Maine; his daughter Ellen of Ireland; his sister Georgia Davies of Calgary  Alberta; six grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and many devoted Canadian and American nieces and nephews.Donations in Demos’ memory can be made to Hospice of the Good Shepherd.
Leonard Lerman  former senior lecturer at MIT  dies at 87,Leonard S. Lerman  a former senior lecturer at MIT and a molecular biologist whose groundbreaking research shaped the way we analyze and manipulate DNA  died Sept. 19 in Cambridge after a long illness.In the early 1960s  Lerman proposed that certain chemicals insert into DNA by intercalation  requiring the DNA double helix to unwind so that the base pairs separate to a certain extent  the degree of separation depending on the intercalator. The unwinding can induce local structural changes in the DNA  which may have serious functional consequences  including the generation of mutations. DNA intercalators  such as aflatoxins and acridines  are often carcinogenic  but can also be potent anticancer agents.On sabbatical leave from the Medical Research Council Laboratories in Cambridge  England  and working with Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick  Lerman generated mutations with DNA-intercalating chemicals; the results were fundamental to the “triplet code” hypothesis for protein synthesis — the way DNA sequences are “read” to specify protein sequences.Lerman also pioneered the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to detect and localize single base changes in genomic DNA and to separate DNA fragments based on their sequence composition. These approaches have had important applications in the screening for variants in human genes  in diagnosing mutations associated with genetic diseases  and in discerning biodiversity in microbial communities.A member of the National Academy of Sciences  Lerman served on the faculties of the University of Colorado School of Medicine  Vanderbilt University  and the State University of New York at Albany. He later worked at the Genetics Institute in Boston and was a senior lecturer at MIT.An inspired gadgeteer  he was known for his creative solutions to everyday problems. He conceived of and built a TV remote control before these were commercially available and  after a visitor accidentally soaked a plaster cast in the guest room shower  he contrived a connection to a vacuum cleaner that dried the cast in a few minutes.Leonard Solomon Lerman was born in 1925 in Pittsburgh  of Ukrainian-Jewish parents. At Taylor Allderdice High School  he studied under Lon Colborn  a legendary chemistry teacher who launched more than 300 students into careers in science. At age 16  Lerman won a science radio show contest in Pittsburgh  and was awarded a scholarship to attend Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). Entering college before he had received a high school diploma  Lerman completed his undergraduate education in five semesters  subsequently working in an experimental weapons research lab during World War II. He did graduate work under Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology and completed a PhD in chemistry in 1950.Lerman mentored two graduate students who went on to win major scientific awards: Sidney Altman (1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) and Tom Maniatis (2012 Lasker-Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science). He is survived by his partner of 20 years  Lisa Steiner  of Cambridge; his former wife  Elizabeth Taylor; three children from his first marriage  to the late Claire Lindegren Lerman  daughters Averil and Lisa and son Alexander; and seven grandchildren.
Leonard A. Gould  EECS emeritus professor  dies at 85,Leonard A. Gould  an alumnus and emeritus professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science died on Saturday  Sept. 8. He was 85.Gould  who received his SB and ScD from MIT in 1948 and 1953 respectively  became a member of the MIT faculty in 1953 and retired in 1997. His research interests included control problems and dynamic modeling in industrial systems (chemical  nuclear  electrical power and rotating machinery)  sampled-data control systems  adaptive estimation and the time series analysis of financial data.Gould worked through the 1940s and '50s in the area of process control as applied to the solution of chemical control problems. His book  "Chemical Process Control " was published in 1969.As associate director of the Electronic Systems Laboratory (ESL)  previously known as the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory  from 1971 to 1976  Gould continued his interest in advanced feedback-control theory. Under Gould's leadership  the ESL provided a new cooperative focus on research and education between staff and students from MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering and his group in electrical engineering.Gould was a fellow of the IEEE since 1973. As a frequent consultant to industry on a wide range of control applications  Gould published many technical articles in that field.He is survived by his wife  Emma  of Dedham; nephew  Neal Spevack  of New York; and Sue Graze of Austin  Texas. Graveside services were held on Tuesday  Sept. 11  at the Beit Olam Cemetery in Wayland  Mass.
Jay K. Lucker  former director of the MIT Libraries  dies at 82,Jay K. Lucker  former director of the MIT Libraries  and nationally known library building and planning consultant  passed away on Sept. 2. He was 82.Lucker was a native of New York City who started his library career at the New York Public Library in 1954  following service in the U.S. Army. He earned an AB degree from Brooklyn College  and an MS degree from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Library Service. While at Brooklyn College he met his wife  Marjorie Stern.Lucker came to the MIT Libraries in 1975 from Princeton University  where he was associate university librarian. During his 20-year career at MIT  he guided the Libraries through the beginning of the transition to many digital library resources and services.“Jay Lucker led the MIT Libraries during a period of exceptional collection growth  as well as in the momentous early years of digital library development. His contributions continue to inspire  and he will be sorely missed ” his successor  MIT Director of Libraries Ann Wolpert  said.While at MIT  Lucker oversaw the award-winning renovation and expansion of MIT’s Rotch Library of Architecture and Planning  completed in 1990. He was active in many library organizations and served as board member and president of the Boston Library Consortium  and as president of the national Association of Research Libraries."Jay Lucker was an outstanding director of the MIT Libraries whom I had the privilege of serving alongside at Academic Council when I was dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences ” Philip Khoury  associate provost and Ford International Professor of History at MIT  said. “He had a fierce intellect and commitment to humanistic learning. He was also vigilant in promoting our libraries as vibrant centers for leading-edge scholarship " Khoury said.Lucker trained and mentored a number of librarians  many of whom would go on to become library directors around the country. Throughout his career  his knowledge and advice on library building and planning was highly sought-after. He served as a consultant to numerous universities  libraries  museums and research organizations  and continued consulting well after his retirement from MIT.“Jay’s legacy extends far beyond Cambridge and the MIT Libraries. His sense of place can be felt in libraries all over the country where he contributed his expertise as an architectural consultant. And his protégés at MIT have gone on to lead the major research libraries and archives of the United States. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his example  counsel  and friendship ” David S. Ferriero  archivist of the United States  and former MIT Libraries associate director for public services under Lucker  said.After his retirement  Lucker would eventually return to his hometown of Brooklyn  where he embarked on a mission to walk through much of Manhattan to explore the architecture of the city. He also volunteered with the nonprofit organization Literacy Partners  teaching a GED math class and getting great satisfaction from watching his students gain confidence in their abilities. Lucker also enjoyed bird watching and reading in his spare time  and was an avid fan of The New York Times crossword puzzle.Lucker is survived by his daughters  Amy and Nancy  son-in-law Joshua  grandson Benjamin  and sister Gloria. He was predeceased by his wife  Marjorie Stern.There are no plans for a public memorial service at this time. Lucker’s family has requested that gifts and donations in his memory be made to the Jay K. Lucker Fund at the MIT Libraries  Planned Parenthood  the Nature Conservancy  ASPCA  and literacy organizations.

Professor emeritus Elias P. Gyftopoulos dies at 84,Elias P. Gyftopoulos  Ford Professor Emeritus of Nuclear  Engineering and Mechanical Engineering  died peacefully at his home in Lincoln   Mass.  on Saturday  June 23. He was 84 years old.Considered by many to be one of the foremost thermodynamicists  of his time  Gyftopoulos was highly regarded for his significant contributions  to the fields of nuclear engineering and mechanical engineering  having held appointments  in both departments at MIT.Born in Greece  Gyftopoulos served in the Greek army while  earning degrees in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering from the  National Technical University of Athens. He left Greece to pursue an ScD in  electrical engineering from MIT  working as both a research assistant and an  instructor in the Department of Electrical Engineering during that time. After  graduating in 1958  he was immediately hired by the department as an assistant professor  and  in 1960  moved to the newly formed Department of Nuclear Engineering. By  1965  he had advanced to the position of professor of nuclear engineering and   from 1968 to 1969  served as acting department head. In 1970  he was named Ford  Professor of Nuclear Engineering and  six years later  Ford Professor of  Nuclear and Mechanical Engineering  a position he held until his retirement in  1996. He served as Chair of the MIT Faculty from 1973 to 1975.Gyftopoulos’s interest in nuclear engineering began with a  survey course on nuclear reactors he took as a doctoral student  in electrical engineering  which in turn led him to develop a new course on  nuclear reactor safety and control. This interest in nuclear reactors caught  the attention of Professor of Mechanical Engineering George Hatsopoulos  who  invited Gyftopoulos to investigate whether nuclear reactors could be used to  convert nuclear energy directly into electricity.In the course of this study  Gyftopoulos identified several  contradictions and inconsistencies that had permeated the understanding of  thermodynamics and physics for decades  and began to direct his research  efforts to reconciling these longstanding issues. The resulting unified quantum  theory of mechanics and thermodynamics formed the basis of a new understanding  of thermodynamics from a non-statistical viewpoint that applies to both  macroscopic and microscopic systems either in a state of thermodynamic  equilibrium or not  providing a self-consistent presentation of thermodynamics.Gyftopoulos was seen by colleagues as a charismatic and  devoted teacher  highly praised and greatly admired by generations of students  for the clarity  depth and rigor of his lectures. For many years  he was the  instructor in charge of a popular core graduate subject  offered jointly by the  mechanical and nuclear engineering departments  that emphasized the  fundamentals as well as applications of thermodynamics. This course led to the  now-classic textbook “Thermodynamics: Foundations and Applications”(co-authored with G.P. Beretta).Gyftopoulos was an outstanding leader of the Greek community  in Boston  and served as a trustee of Anatolia College  the American Farm  School and Hellenic College. He served on the boards of several private  companies and as chairman of the National Energy Council of Greece.For his many extraordinary contributions to the fields of  nuclear and mechanical engineering  Gyftopoulos received numerous awards   including the Ruth and Joel Spira Award of the School of Engineering for  Teaching Excellence  the James Harry Potter Gold Medal of the American Society  of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)  the Edward F. Obvert Award of ASME  the Robert  Henry Thurston Lecture Award of ASME  and the Commander of Order of Merit of  the Republic of Greece.Gyftopoulos was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  and a corresponding member of the Academy of Athens  as well as a fellow of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences  ASME  the American Nuclear Society  and the  American Association for the Advancement of Science.He is survived by his three loving daughters  Vasso  Maro  and Rena Gyftopoulos. His beloved wife Artemis passed away in 2011.The funeral service will be held on Thursday  June 28  at  10:45 a.m. at the Holy Cross Seminary Chapel at Hellenic College-Holy Cross  Orthodox School of Theology  50 Goddard Ave.  Brookline  Mass. Visiting hours will  be held on Wednesday  June 27  from 4 to 8 p.m. A public memorial service for Gyftopoulos will take place from 3-4 p.m. on Tuesday  Oct. 9  at the MIT Chapel. A reception will follow at Twenty Chimneys.In lieu of flowers  gifts in Gyftopoulos' name may be made to MIT for theElias P. Gyftopoulos (1958) Memorial Scholarship Fund(to provide scholarship support for undergraduate students from Greece) or theElias P. Gyftopoulos (1958) Fellowship Fund(to support graduate students in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering). Gifts may also be mailed toBonny Kellermann  MIT Office of Memorial Gifts  600 Memorial Drive  Room W98-514  Cambridge MA 02139.
George Gardner  longtime MIT Corporation member  dies at 94,George Peabody Gardner  a member of the MIT Corporation since 1959  died on Wednesday  May 9. He was 94.Gardner was born in 1917 in Newton  Mass.  and worked for many years in the advertising department at theBoston Heraldand at the Batten  Barton  Durstine  and Osborn Advertising Agency. He graduated from Harvard College in 1939  and served in the U.S. Navy for six years during World War II.Gardner was a director of Arthur D. Little  Kaiman Aircraft Corp.  Barry Controls Inc.  The Wright Line Inc.  Macalaster Scientific Corp.  Instron  Lestoil  W.R. Grace  Oxbow Corp.  and Stanley Home Products Inc. He was chairman of United Fruit Co. and the Wang Center of Boston  and was a trustee of Boston’s Museum of Science  where he was president from 1954 to 1959.In 1959  Gardner was elected to the MIT Corporation  the Institute’s Board of Trustees; he became a life member in 1963. During his Corporation tenure  Gardner served on numerous committees  including the Executive Committee  the Investment Committee  the Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Visiting Committee  and the Ocean Engineering Visiting Committee.He was predeceased by his beloved son  G. Peabody Gardner Jr.  and his wife of 63 years  Tatiana Stepanova Gardner. Gardner leaves behind his two daughters  Alexandra and Tatiana; his daughter-in-law  Susan; his one son-in-law; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  donations may be sent to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston; Escuela Agricola Pan Americana in Washington; or the Museum of Science in Boston. A memorial service will take place at 10:30 a.m. Saturday  June 16  at Trinity Church  Copley Square  Boston. Burial will be private.
George Koster  physics professor emeritus  dies at 85,George Fred Koster  a condensed matter physicist who contributed to advances in research on semi-conductor materials and a devoted MIT educator who challenged students to demand excellence of themselves  died in his Brookline  Mass.  home on May 14. He was 85.
William F. Brace  professor emeritus in EAPS  dies at 86,William F. Brace ‘46  ‘49  PhD ’53  professor emeritus in the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences  died Wednesday  May 2  of complications following heart surgery. He was 86.Brace was born in Littleton  N.H.  and educated in the Boston area  finishing preparatory school in Danvers. He matriculated as an MIT undergraduate in 1943  and  following a tour of duty in the Navy  obtained SB degrees in naval architecture in 1946 and in civil engineering in 1949. In 1953  he earned a PhD from MIT’s Department of Geology and Geophysics.Perhaps motivated  at least in part  by his love of the outdoors  he completed his dissertation in structural geology  studying the fabric and structure of rocks from the Green Mountain anticlinorium near Rutland  Vt. In that study  Brace remarked that interpretations of the field relations were limited by the lack of reliable mechanical data on natural rocks.The academic career that followed was a brilliant and successful attempt to fill that intellectual void. Following a postdoctoral fellowship with Francis Birch at Harvard University  Brace established a rock mechanics laboratory in the geology department at MIT. Using an extremely stiff testing apparatus — which Brace designed using principles gained by studying ship design — he investigated the fracture properties of granite  marble and sandstone.In a watershed study in 1964  Brace demonstrated a causal relationship between shear fracture of rocks and stress-induced micro cracking. Other definitive studies of the dilatancy that occurs during compressive failure have formed a broader basis of understanding of the failure of highly confined materials.With James Byerlee of Stanford University  Brace realized that the stick-slip friction events observed in the laboratory could be used to understand ruptures occurring at much larger scale during destructive earthquakes. In a long and fruitful collaboration with Joseph Walsh of MIT  Brace used careful experiments  thorough mechanical analyses  and thoughtful observations of microstucture to develop a systematic constitutive description of such physical properties of rocks as acoustic wave velocity  electrical resistivity and permeability.Brace’s work can be characterized  colleagues said  by its thoroughness and high standards in both experimental technique and underlying understanding of fundamental physics and mechanics. He often designed and developed new testing apparatus  including the stiff press mentioned above and an internally heated servo-controlled mechanical testing device used to study inelastic behavior of crustal rocks at high temperatures. Brace also pioneered new techniques to study permeability in crystalline rocks  electrical properties of water-saturated rocks under high confining pressure  and the detailed microstructure of ruptured materials using argon-etching techniques. Throughout this remarkable body of work  colleagues said  Brace never lost sight of his ultimate goal: applying the results of these studies to natural deformation.With MIT’s Christopher Goetze and other collaborators  Brace showed that data from mechanical tests could be used to produce a simple  quantitative description of the strength of the Earth’s crust. No one was more aware than Brace of the limits in such a generic description  but Goetze-Brace strength profiles are still used today as starting models in studies of geodynamics and structural geology. Remarkably  Brace’s career started in a succinct statement of an ambitious scientific goal and ended with robust descriptions for a wide variety of physical properties.Brace’s professional contributions were recognized by election to the National Academy of Sciences and by selection as a fellow of the Geological Society of America  the American Geophysical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was presented with the Bucher Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 1987 and with a Distinguished Achievement Award from the U.S. National Committee on Rock Mechanics in the same year.From 1976 to 1988  Brace was the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Geology at MIT; from 1981 to 1988 he served as the head of the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences — a department that arose under his leadership from the merging of MIT’s Course XII  Earth and Planetary Sciences  and Course XIX  Meteorology and Physical Oceanography. Brace’s efforts as department head were essential to ensuring a well-balanced and thorough approach in thinking about the Earth and its processes as part of a unified system.Brace had a deep love for the outdoors  and was an avid hiker  skier  bicyclist and distance runner. He competed in the Boston Marathon and ran up (and down) Pikes Peak and the Grand Canyon. In retirement  he became an accomplished cabinetmaker  combining deep understanding of the mechanical properties of wood with technical joinery and profound artistry.Brace is survived by his wife  Margaret; sons  Nathaniel and Colin' daughter  Sarah; and several grandchildren. A memorial service will be held June 12 at 11 a.m. at the Unitarian Church in Concord  Mass.  where he was a resident.

Lois Craig  former associate dean in the School of Architecture + Planning  dies at 82,Lois Craig  associate dean of the School of Architecture + Planning in the 1980s and early 1990s  died March 23 in Chicago after a long illness. She was 82.A trusted and valued adviser to many architecture students and graduates during her years at MIT  Craig was respected for her intellectual contributions to her field as much as for her understanding of administrative issues. In nominating her to the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1989  the Boston Society of Architects said that Craig had made "an unusually comprehensive contribution to our profession  to the art and science of architecture and to the public."Before coming to MIT in 1978  Craig was director of the Federal  Architecture Project at the National Endowment for the Arts  the U.S.  government’s effort to improve federal building programs. In that  pioneering role she contributed to the development of new  designer-selection procedures  new legislation governing public building  and the first comprehensive history of federal government architecture.The Federal Presence: Architecture  Politics and National Design—  developed with the staff of the Federal Architecture Project — was  published by MIT Press in 1978.Previously  she served as professional staff for the National Urban  Coalition  Housing and Urban Growth Division  interpreting the impact of  legislation  court decision  government programs and local initiatives  on land use and housing opportunities. Before that  she was research  director for the communications division of Urban America  Inc.  and senior editor atCITY Magazine.Read more
Development economist Alice Amsden dies at 68,Alice H. Amsden  an expert in  economic development who served as the Barton L. Weller Professor of Political  Economy in MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning  died suddenly on  March 14 at her home in Cambridge. She was 68.A prolific scholar  Amsden wrote  extensively about the process of industrialization in emerging economies   particularly in Asia. Her work frequently emphasized the importance of the  state as a creator of economic growth  and challenged the idea that  globalization had produced generally uniform conditions in which emerging  economies could find a one-size-fits-all path to prosperity.“She will be  sorely missed ” said Amy K. Glasmeier  professor of geography and regional planning and  head of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and  Planning. “Upon hearing  the news  one student said to me  ‘she was a titan’ in the field of  development. While others took the conventional way  Alice took another path.  She was fearless. By any measure  Alice was one of the most  if notthemost  accomplished heterodox  economist in the world.”Amsden wrote or co-authored seven  books  and dozens of journal articles  essays and chapters in edited volumes.  She also wrote frequently for general-interest publications; her work appeared  in The New York Times  The Nation  Dissent  Boston Review  Technology Review  and others.One of Amsden’s best-known books  was “The Rise of ‘The Rest’: Challenges to the West from Late-Industrializing  Economies ” published by Oxford University Press in 2001. In it  she examined  the way Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had helped produce  growth through state-promoted industrialization. By contrast  Amsden observed   some Latin American countries had accommodated a greater degree of overseas  investment  leaving more economic decisions in the hands of multinational  firms  not state actors.Amsden was a co-winner of the  2002 Leontief Prize  along with Harvard University’s Dani Rodrik  an annual  award granted by Tufts University in recognition of important “contributions to  economic theory that … support just and sustainable societies.” The prize is  named for the prominent late economist Wassily Leontief.In her acceptance remarks for the  Leontief Prize  Amsden stressed the importance of the close study of developing  countries  because “there are a lot of people out there that are disappointed  and that desperately want improved living conditions and social standards.”Amsden was born in New York City   received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1965  and her PhD  from the London School of Economics in 1971. She began her career as an  economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)   and before joining MIT in 1994  taught at the University of California at Los  Angeles  Barnard College  Harvard Business School  and The New School. At MIT   she held the Ellen Swallow Richards Institute Chair from 1994 until 1999  when  she was named the Weller Professor.Beyond her teaching and  scholarship  Amsden served as a consultant to the OECD  the World Bank  and  multiple programs within the United Nations. In 2009  she was appointed by U.N.  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to a three-year seat on the U.N. Committee on  Development Policy  part of the U.N. Economic and Social Council; the committee  provides advice to the council on a wide range of economic development issues.Amsden is  survived by her sister and brother-in-law  Myra Strober and Jay Jackman of  Stanford  Calif.; nephew Jason Strober  his wife  Joanna Strober  and their  children  Sarah  Jared and Ari  of Los Altos Hills  Calif.; niece Elizabeth  Strober  her husband  Bryan Cohen  and their son  Leo Strober Cohen  of Seattle;  nephew Rashi Jackman  his wife Maike Ahrends  and their son  Jasper Ahrends  of  Palo Alto  Calif.; nephew Jason Scott and his wife  Lena Chu  of Mountain View   Calif.; and niece Tenaya Jackman of Oakland  Calif. Amsden was previously  married to John Amsden and to Takhashi Hikino.The Department of Urban Studies and Planning will be hostinga commemorative symposium and memorialfor Amsden on Oct. 19-20 in the new Media Lab building. More details will be available in the fall.
Louis S. Osborne PhD ’50  longtime MIT physicist  dies at 88,Louis S. Osborne  a particle physicist whose cutting-edge research inspired colleagues and students alike  died Jan. 22 of congestive heart failure. A long-time resident of Lexington  Mass  Osborne was 88.Osborne PhD '50 worked as an experimental physicist  using photons  electrons and neutrinos to probe matter. He performed some of the early and seminal experiments to measure the photo-production of mesons from nuclei and developed many of the experimental techniques that are now standard practice in high-energy physics.His research provided experimental data that contributed to the confirmation of the unitary symmetry model  which is the periodic table of the particles affected by the strong force and is an important component of the current model of the fundamental particles and their interactions.Physics Professor and Department Head Edmund Bertschinger described Osborne as a “gentle giant of physics — giant in his capacity to find and develop the best in people. He trained many leaders in physics and industry. We will miss him dearly.”A native of Rome  Italy  Osborne received his BS from the California Institute of Technology  where he studied under Nobel Laureate Robert A. Millikan  famed for his oil drop experiment that measured for the first time the value of the elementary charge. After Caltech  Osborne served in the U.S. Navy  tending radar on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. He arrived at MIT as a graduate student full of enthusiasm for physics  good humor and a love of all things Italian — qualities that never dimmed  according to colleagues.“Lou embodied the joy of discovery. He was curious about everything and deeply committed to the big questions of high-energy physics ” said Frank Taylor  senior research scientist in the Laboratory for Nuclear Science.Pondering pionsOsborne’s MIT career began with conducting research at the Laboratory for Nuclear Science in 1948 and with directing the MIT Synchrotron in 1950  where he carried out pioneering experiments in the photo-production of pions (pi-mesons)  aiming to shed light on how these newly discovered subatomic particles are produced.Later he worked with his students to develop the Differential Cerenkov Counter. Used to identify particles over a wide range of masses  the Cerenkov Counter has had important applications in the field of particle and nuclear physics.Osborne joined the MIT faculty in 1959. In total  he devoted more than 50 years to understanding the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces with which they interact.“Lou was an outstanding hands-on experimental physicist  always at the cutting edge ” said Nobel Laureate Jerome Friedman  an Institute Professor emeritus and Osborne’s physics department colleague.Osborne continued his pion photo-production studies at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA)  which opened in 1962. Osborne welcomed the new facility with warmth  saying  “It was built with a marvelous attitude towards reliability … and with affection.”His CEA experiments  carried out at higher energies  contributed “important information in clarifying a number of physics issues  including providing evidence for two new pion-nucleon resonances that contributed to the confirmation of unitary symmetry ” said Lawrence Rosenson  professor of physics emeritus  and an MIT colleague.Osborne next joined Taylor  Rosenson and Friedman in an experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago  studying deep-inelastic neutrino scattering from the nucleon. Their experiment provided an “important test of the Standard Model  our current model of the fundamental particles and their interactions ” noted Friedman.Collaborations at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) National Laboratory  the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in Texas and at CERN  the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva  followed. Thanks to Osborne  “all these campaigns were great adventures ” Taylor said.David Luckey  a CERN physicist and an MIT colleague for 20 years  said the highlight of his work with Osborne was “trying to build a magnetic detector for e+e-.” Luckey credits Osborne  a scientific associate at CERN for 10 years  with focusing on experiments that would later lead to advances in physics.Fiddling with the knobsOsborne’s ability to zero in on research with implications for the future made him an “ideal colleague and a terrific mentor of graduate students ” Rosenson noted.Osborne served as thesis advisor to  among others  Burton Richter PhD ’56  a Nobel laureate and former SLAC director; Roy Schwitters PhD '70  a former SSC director; and Virgil Elings PhD '66  co-founder of Digital Instruments  which designed and sold scanning probe microscopes.Osborne demanded his students develop confidence and independence — strengths of hand and mind crucial to sustaining world-class research. Elings had a physical encounter with this philosophy when his adviser once tore the wiring out of a device he was working on. “You can figure it out ” Osborne said.“Lou believed in fiddling with the knobs  in doing it yourself. He was the first person to have such confidence in me ” Elings said.Osborne’s lab in Building 24 fostered that "fiddle-with-the-knobs" ethos Elings found so inspiring. Odd but useful pieces of equipment lay about the basement room. It was “easy to do small experiments as well as design and build prototype muon tracking chambers ” Taylor said. “People who worked in that lab were happy to work with Lou.”In addition to carrying out experiments  teaching and advising  Osborne had an excellent command of theory and published a number of phenomenological models. While at MIT  he was granted a Fulbright Award  a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Minna-James-Heineman Fellowship. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Osborne is survived by his wife  Barbara (Schiller); his sons  Marc and Duncan; his son  Brian  and daughter-in-law  Isabelle; his stepchildren  Amy and Michael  and their spouses; two nieces and five grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel on April 3  2012  at 1:30 p.m. with a reception to follow in the Pappalardo Community Room (Building 4-349).Contributions in Osborne’s honor may be sent to the MIT Office of Memorial Gifts.
Robert Whitman  longtime CEE professor  dies at 84,Robert V. Whitman SM ’49  ScD ’51  a world-renowned geotechnical engineer and expert on earthquakes in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)  died on Feb. 25. He was 84.With the exception of two years spent in military service  Whitman was with CEE from 1948 until his retirement in 1993  and he remained an active member of the MIT community for many more years as a professor emeritus.“Bob was a tremendous role model as a faculty member  renowned for his ability to clarify the complexities of soil mechanics and earthquake engineering  and for his commitment to serve society at-large through leadership in professional organizations ” said CEE Department Head Andrew Whittle.Born in Edgewood  Pa.  he majored in civil engineering at Swarthmore College with a concentration in structures and later studied structural dynamics with Professor Charles Norris at MIT. Then  for his ScD research  he chose to work with Professor Donald Taylor on the effects of nuclear explosives on underground structures. While working with Taylor’s group  he met his future wife  Elizabeth “Betsy” Cushman  and the two were married in June 1954.From 1954 to 1956  Whitman served in the Navy as an officer in the Civil Engineer Corps stationed at Pearl Harbor  Hawaii. Afterward  he resumed his research into the effects of weapons and protective construction and served on the Air Force’s advisory panel for the earliest hardened missile complexes. In the 1960s  he worked on developing stable foundations for long-range tracking radars  research that led him to become a leading expert in the new discipline of soil dynamics.Whitman then moved into earthquake engineering  initially through a joint study with Professor Harry Seed of the University of California at Berkeley. Research followed on various aspects of building vulnerability  liquefaction  soil-structure interaction  design of earth-retaining structures and stability of earthen dams and dikes.During his transition from soil dynamics to earthquake engineering  Whitman and MIT Professor Bill Lambe co-wrote the acclaimed textbookSoil Mechanics(John Wiley & Sons  1969). “Of all the things I’ve done  I’m probably proudest of that book ” Whitman said in an oral history published by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) in 2009.Reducing earthquake hazards were a major focus for Whitman during the 1970s  when he helped develop the Massachusetts State Seismic Code and worked on framing the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.Then  in 1979  Whitman took a sabbatical at Cambridge University  where he was drawn to centrifuge research. He subsequently helped to introduce centrifuge testing to the U.S. geotechnical community. Whitman also pioneered the study of risk-based geotechnical engineering; he presented his work on risk analysis at the Terzaghi Lecture in 1981 at the American Society of Civil Engineer’s (ASCE) National Convention.Over the years  Whitman served on many scientific and government advisory boards  including the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and the National Research Council’s Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems. He helped form the Federal Emergency Management Agency's five-year Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Plan and chaired the National Research Council’s committee that produced the influential report Liquefaction of Soils During Earthquakes (1985).He also made significant contributions to the Applied Technology Council’s report Tentative Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for Buildings  which provided the first national earthquake hazard maps. He chaired the National Research Council panel that proposed a methodology for estimating losses from earthquakes and led the committee that developed a nationally applicable standardized methodology (called HAZUS) for estimating potential losses from earthquakes  floods and hurricanes.Whitman received numerous honors for his contributions to the field. The EERI inducted him in 1972  and he later served as the society’s first president from outside California. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1975. The ASCE gave him the Terzaghi Award for outstanding contributions to knowledge in the fields of soil mechanics  subsurface and earthwork engineering  and he received the EERI's George W. Housner Medal for sustained leadership and contributions to earthquake engineering.At MIT  Whitman undertook numerous leadership roles  notably serving as parliamentarian at Institute faculty meetings during the tumultuous Vietnam War-era student uprisings. Known for his devotion to teaching and research  he will also be remembered by many for his personal warmth. He and his wife frequently hosted graduate students for meals and annually celebrated the end of the school year with a party. In his hometown of Lexington  Mass.  Whitman was also known for helping to clarify issues at Town Meeting  where he served as an elected official for decades.In addition to his wife of 57 years  Whitman is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren. Another daughter predeceased him. A memorial service was to be held at the Church of Our Redeemer in Lexington on March 1 at 1 p.m. Donations may be made in his memory to Citizens for Lexington Conservation Inc.  P.O. Box 292  Lexington  MA 02420-0003 or to theChebeague and Cumberland Land Trust.
‘A young man who was so spectacularly gifted’,At Brian G. Anderson’s memorial service in Minnesota on Saturday  friends and family agreed on certain things about the MIT junior: He was fearless and strong. He was brilliant and loved MIT. He was frequently barefoot and in trees — often at the same time.“He was a full-speed-ahead  pedal-to-the-metal type of guy ” his mother  Cecilia Anderson  said at the memorial service. “He was quick as a jackrabbit: both physically and mentally gifted. He loved outwitting people  and he had an indomitable spirit. There was nothing he couldn’t do if he put his mind to it.”Anderson  21  whose body was found Feb. 20 in his Next House dorm room  was a management (Course 15) major and a member of the MIT wrestling team.Brian Gregory Anderson was born Nov. 28  1990  in Redwood Falls  Minn.  the youngest of three sons of Gregory and Cecilia Anderson. Weighing 9 lbs.  6 oz.  at birth  he looked like he “had just gone the distance in a boxing match ” his brother Tom said. “I always knew [he was] going to be tough.”When his two brothers  five and eight years older  invited friends over to play tackle football  Anderson never hesitated to join in. “Although he was the little bro  it soon became clear that there was nothing little or timid about him ” his brother Ray said. “He would get riled up if someone told him he couldn’t accomplish something  particularly if that someone was an older brother.”Silos  skydiving and scubaFrom a young age  Anderson showed a remarkable lack of fear of heights. While still a preschooler  he climbed to the top of a silo on the family’s Minnesota farm  waving and yelling hello to his startled grandmother below. At age 15  he joined his parents and brothers on a rim-to-rim hike of the Grand Canyon.As a child  Anderson “climbed more trees than anyone else I know ” Tom Anderson said. He was particularly fond of doing so barefoot — and of walking barefoot on gravel roads and even through ice and snow. “Your feet were somehow numb to every surface you walked on ” Tom Anderson noted at his brother’s memorial service. “You just were really never a sock person.”Anderson’s interest in heights continued: He was planning to take skydiving lessons this summer  even convincing his father to join him. “He had no fear of anything or anybody ” Cecilia Anderson said.During his many years as a Boy Scout — culminating in earning the rank of Eagle Scout in 2009  and in winning the coveted “Triple Crown” for attending all three of the Boy Scouts’ national camps — Anderson went to a different extreme: He introduced scuba training to Troop 70  leading the troop to participate in 11 deep-sea dives at the National Boy Scout Camp in the Florida Keys.‘The twinkle in his eye’As Anderson grew older  his family and friends observed the blossoming of his intellect and curiosity. At his memorial service  Pastor Pari Bailey of Grace Lutheran Church in Belview  Minn.  described first meeting him as a student in her confirmation class. As Bailey explained various atonement theologies  the high-school sophomore chimed in with a sophisticated question contrasting the views of Lutheran and Eastern Orthodox churches on the matter.“My mouth fell open ” Bailey recalled. “And as I began to respond to this incredibly intelligent question … I caught the twinkle in his eye. Brian had just taken my measure and let me know three things without actually coming right out and saying them. One  he was brilliant. Two  he was doing some serious extracurricular reading. Three  he was not opposed to yanking the pastor’s chain a bit.”By this time  Anderson had already set his sights on MIT. At Saturday’s memorial service  Bailey read from the letter of recommendation that she ultimately wrote on his behalf: “He looks me in the eye. He is kind to children. He has the respect of his peers.”The lure of MITAnderson’s interest in MIT took root early  in seventh grade — although he didn’t confide this to his parents for another three years. He was attracted to the Institute  his father said  by “the level of people he’d be dealing with.”“He knew he needed to get away” from rural Minnesota  his mother added. “He needed a lot of intellectual stimulus.”So determined was Anderson to gain acceptance to MIT that he took the ACT four times  hoping to nudge his scores upward. During this time  Gregory and Cecilia Anderson noted  their son also taught himself German  which wasn’t offered in the schools around Redwood Falls.Anderson was elated upon winning early acceptance to MIT midway through his senior year at Redwood Valley High School  his mother recalled. “That night in December 2008 had him high-fiving everyone in the house; he was so happy ” Cecilia Anderson said.Eager to achieveAnderson entered MIT planning to study brain and cognitive science. He ultimately switched to management  his parents said  because he was driven to achieve things quickly  in a field that wouldn’t require many years of graduate school.At MIT  Anderson was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity  and spent a spring break building houses for Habitat for Humanity in Jacksonville  Fla. He was also a three-year member of MIT’s wrestling team  continuing in the sport he had grown to love in high school — and in which he had persisted following two anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries  during his junior year of high school and his sophomore year at MIT.During his first year at MIT  the team won the 2010 National Collegiate Wrestling Association Division II National Championship. Tom Layte  coach of MIT’s wrestling team — who first encountered Anderson as a high-school sophomore attending a summer wrestling camp at Augsburg College in Minneapolis — described Anderson as having a strong work ethic and a great sense of humor. He was also  Layte said  a team player  dedicated  friendly and polite.“Everyone on the team adored Brian ” Layte said. “He was not the quickest or most technical wrestler  but he was methodical and strong and felt like you were wrestling with a bear.”In January  Anderson’s parents spent several weeks on the East Coast  following him to various wrestling matches.“Brian was so happy ” his father said. “He loved MIT. He worked hard to handle both the tough academics and the physical training for the small but exceptional wrestling program. It didn’t matter how much bigger or how smart someone was  Brian was determined to keep up with them.”Anderson is survived by his parents  Gregory and Cecilia  of Redwood Falls  Minn.; brothers Raymond  of Reedley  Calif.  and Thomas  of Anoka  Minn.; grandparents Betty Prahl of Redwood Falls  Minn.  and George and Nancy Kroening of Brooklyn Park  Minn.; and many aunts  uncles and cousins.NOTE: MIT will hold a memorial service commemorating the life of Brian G. Anderson on Saturday  March 17  at 4 p.m. in the MIT Chapel. A reception will follow in Building W11.
MIT community mourns the death of junior Brian G. Anderson,Around noon today  MIT junior Brian G. Anderson was found deceased in his room in the Next House dormitory. Anderson  21  was a native of Redwood Falls  Minn.The Massachusetts State Police and the Middlesex District Attorney are conducting an investigation  which is standard protocol with a sudden death. The MIT Police are assisting in the investigation  and report that there is no imminent danger to the MIT community. The state Medical Examiner’s office has not yet given its determination of the cause of death; that process typically takes days or weeks.“This is a painful time for the entire MIT community as we grieve for Brian ” said Chancellor Eric Grimson. “Our thoughts are with all those who knew and loved Brian. And as we mourn for him  I want to ask all members of the MIT community to be proactive in seeking and offering help. This is not the first student death of this year  and so it is even more important than usual that we all come together and take care of each other.”Read the letter to students from Chancellor Grimson“Questions will naturally arise about the circumstances of this death ” Grimson continued. “In order to get complete answers  we must allow time for the authorities to conduct their investigation. I encourage everyone to refrain from speculation. At this early stage  there is no strong indication that Brian’s death was the result of suicide.”Anderson was a Course 15 (Management) major at MIT. He was an active member of MIT’s wrestling team and a member of the formerly active Beta Theta Pi fraternity.MIT’s full range of student support and mental health services is being made available to the residents of Next House and all members of the MIT community. Barbara Baker  the senior associate dean for students  says students can also turn to their housemasters and graduate resident tutors (GRTs) for support at this difficult time  as well as resident advisors in the Fraternities  Sororities  and Independent Living Groups (FSILGs).All members of the MIT community who feel affected by this death are encouraged to contact Mental Health Services at 617-253-2916.The News Office will update this piece as more information becomes available.
Historian of science Charles Weiner dies at 80,Charles Weiner  professor emeritus of the history of science and technology at MIT  died Saturday  Jan. 28  in West Cork  Ireland. He was 80 and resided in New York and Yarmouth Port  Mass.Weiner died during an extended stay on Ireland’s Beara Peninsula with his wife  JoAnn Hughes  after struggling with congestive heart failure.Weiner was the pre-eminent historian of his generation focusing on the political  social and ethical dimensions of contemporary science and the responses of scientists to public controversies arising from their work. Educated at the Case Institute of Technology first in metallurgy (BS 1960) and then in the history of science and technology (PhD 1965)  he had a strong generational attachment to the cultural currents of the American working class. He worked for a time as an autoworker  traveled the country  and sought out and knew singers such as Woody Guthrie. He served briefly in the U.S. Army both in Korea and Japan.Upon receiving his PhD  Weiner became director of the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics from 1965 to 1974  and then moved to MIT  serving from 1975 to 1986 as director of the MIT Oral History Program.In response to widespread fears that the then-new technology of recombinant DNA could escape into the world with dire consequences — MIT’s oral history archives include footage of raucous Cambridge City Council hearings in the mid-1970s on the Institute’s request to use recombinant DNA in research — Weiner interviewed a wide array of American molecular biologists and physicists on the issue. For many years he taught the Science  Technology and Society (STS) Program’s largest undergraduate course  “Politics and Ethics in American Science.”When an STS graduate program was established  Weiner taught a key graduate seminar  often with historian of science Lily Kay  on the history of molecular biology with a strong emphasis on ethical questions over patenting  eugenics  privacy  insurance and health policy. A central topic in the course was the self-regulation of molecular biology that had been initiated by the Asilomar Conference in 1975 as part of the debate over recombinant DNA. With Kay  Weiner organized a series of Mellon Foundation-supported workshops at MIT  bringing together leading historians of biology along with Nobel Laureates such as Sydney Brenner.Together with MIT anthropologist Michael Fischer  he taught a course on Superfund toxic cleanup sites in Massachusetts  where he brought together on neutral academic ground environmental regulators  community activists and corporate geologists. Students in the course offered their MIT training in environmental science to communities and wrote about the experience.After his retirement from MIT  Weiner remained active around the country supporting community-based research on the effects of uranium mining in the American Southwest. He was recruited by the University of California at Berkley to initiate a new course on such issues as debates about the migration of genetically engineered corn into surrounding crops in Mexico and the controversy over the denial of tenure to a young professor who had published research on the subject.Weiner was a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  and delivered the 2002 Arthur Miller Lecture on Science and Ethics at MIT. He edited four volumes on the history of science: “Robert Oppenheimer: Letters and Recollections” (with Alice Kimball Smith)  “Exploring the History of Nuclear Physics ” “History of Twentieth Century Physics ” and “The Legacy of George Ellery Hale.”Weiner left unfinished at his death a work on the history of social responsibility in science  from the atomic bomb to contemporary genetic engineering. It uses archival and oral history materials to document scientists’ complicity in and resistance to nuclear and biological weapons  their connections with citizens’ groups affected by environmental toxins and by fallout from nuclear testing  and anticipatory concerns about ethical limits in human genetic manipulation.An aficionado of jazz and good food and a wonderful conversationalist  “Charlie” — as he was known to all — will be sorely missed as the kind of committed historian of science that America needs.Weiner is survived by his wife  artist JoAnn Hughes of Yarmouth Port  Mass.  and his daughter Susan Andrea Weiner and her husband  Scott Underwood  of El Cerrito  Calif.  from his previous marriage to Shirley Marks  of Walnut Creek  Calif.He is also survived by two brothers  Peter Weiner of New York and Jack Weiner of Oriental  N.C.  and by nieces and nephews Rebecca Weiner Tompkins of Brooklyn  N.Y.  Amy W. Miller of Miami  Andrew Weiner of Albany  Calif.  Lexie Holton of Texas  and Josh Weiner of New York.Weiner is also survived by three stepchildren — Jennifer Reif of Brewster  Mass.  Ron Reif of Falmouth  Mass.  and Amelia Hirsch of San Francisco — and by six grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at Cotuit Center for the Arts  4404 Route 28 (Falmouth Rd.)  Cotuit  Mass.  on Saturday  Feb. 4  from 2-4 p.m.

Gene Chamberlain  longtime MIT staff member  dies at 91,Eugene R. “Gene” Chamberlain  who worked in MIT’s International Students Office (ISO) for 32 years  serving as a director for 10 of those years  passed away Thursday  Dec. 8  in Hingham  Mass. He was 91.As a staff member in the ISO  Chamberlain acted as a friend and mentor to many students from abroad  working tirelessly to help them fully integrate into the MIT community.“He was enormously kind  enormously helpful — quite a remarkable man ” says Robert Randolph  Chaplain to the Institute and a former colleague of Chamberlain’s. “He was really the voice for international students at MIT. He demanded that they be given the support they needed to be successful  and laid the foundation for the contemporary approach to how we deal with students from other countries.”Born in Chicago  Chamberlain spent parts of his childhood in London and in his father’s hometown of Prescott  Ontario  Canada. On the advice of his father  he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July 1940  seeing action in Morocco and at the Pacific islands of Truk  Saipan  Palau and Yap and rising to the rank of ensign. He met his wife  Helen  in Hingham while he was on leave visiting family. They married in 1945.Following the war  Gene attended Denison University  where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and was voted friendliest man on campus. He returned to the Boston area and worked a brief stint in business before arriving at MIT  where he worked in the International Students Office  rising to a director’s position in 1976.There  he helped fulfill the mission of the ISO by ensuring all international students’ needs — academic  legal and social — were met. Part of his role was acting as an associate director of admissions  evaluating applications from international students; another part was helping build community for the thousands of international students already on campus as associate dean for student affairs.“At the time when Gene retired from MIT  former students literally came from around the world to express their appreciation for how much he helped them feel at home here ” says Bonny Kellermann  a colleague of Chamberlain’s and the director of special constituencies in the Office of Leadership Giving.Chamberlain’s exceptional service to the community was officially recognized on two occasions. In June 2005  he was made an honorary member of the MIT Alumni Association  an honor bestowed on very select individuals for “outstanding service to the Association or the Institute.” He also received a Billard Award for Special Service in 1985  in recognition of “special service of outstanding merit” for the Institute.Following his retirement in 1986  Chamberlain devoted himself to the community of Hingham  serving as president of the town’s historical society and earning the distinction of Citizen of the Year from the local newspaper.His wife  Helen  predeceased him in 2004. He is survived by two daughters  Betsy C. Habich of North Reading  Mass.  and Anne H. Tuite of Shrub Oak  N.Y.; a son  Richard R. Chamberlain of Hingham  Mass.; and three grandchildren  Christopher “Topher” Howard Chamberlain  Matthew Howard Tuite and John “Jack” Ryan Tuite.A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday  Jan. 14  at the Second Parish Church  685 Main St. (Rte. 228)  Hingham  Mass. Donations may be made in Chamberlain’s memory to the Hingham Historical Society  P.O. Box 434  Hingham  MA 02043 or the Hingham Public Library  66 Leavitt St.  Hingham  MA 02043.
Professor emeritus Adel Sarofim SM ’57  ScD ’62 dies at 77,Adel F. Sarofim  a professor emeritus in the Department of Chemical Engineering  died Dec. 4 in Virginia. He was 77.Focusing on energy efficiency and pollution reduction  Sarofim spent more than 50 years working on combustion science  which led to advances in the reduction of pollutants released from fossil fuel combustion. His research covered radiative heat transfer  furnace design  circulation patterns in glass melts  the freeze process for desalination  nitric oxide formation in combustion systems  combustion-generated aerosols  soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation  and the characterization of carbon structure and reactivity.Working closely with MIT colleague Hoyt C. Hottel  Sarofim made important and lasting contributions to the field of radiation heat transfer  as evidenced by more than 1 200 citations of their book Radiative Heat Transfer published in 1967.A particular focus of Sarofim’s work was on energy and the environment and the interdisciplinary research needed to address these issues. As such  at MIT he served on steering committees for three interdisciplinary research centers: the Hazardous Substances Group  the Energy Laboratory and the Center for Environmental Health Sciences. He was also co-founder and director of MIT’s 10-year EPA Center for Airborne Organics (1992-2002).He received his BA in chemistry from Oxford University in the U.K.  and both his SM and ScD in chemical engineering at MIT. Sarofim was named an instructor at MIT in 1958  became a faculty member in 1961  and was named the Lammot du Pont Professor in 1989. He retired in 1996 to join the University of Utah as Presidential Professor  a ranking “reserved for selected individuals whose achievements exemplify the highest goals of scholarship as demonstrated by recognition accorded to them from peers with national and international stature  and whose record includes evidence of a high dedication to teaching.” He has authored or co-authored more than 350 papers.According to colleagues  Sarofim always said the best indication of scholarship was students and publications. His more than 350 peer-reviewed papers and documents have had almost 5 000 citations. In addition to his teaching responsibilities  he supervised and mentored more than 80 PhD students  many of whom currently hold prestigious academic  industrial and governmental positions.Sarofim received numerous awards for his work including the Kuwait Prize for Petrochemical Engineering (1983); the Sir Alfred Egerton Gold Medal from the Combustion Institute (1984); the Walter Ahlstrom Environmental Prize of the Finnish Academies of Technology (1993); Senior Thermal Engineering and the Towend-BCURA Awards of the Institute of Energy (1994); University of Pittsburgh Award for Innovation in Coal Conversion (1995); U.S. Department of Energy Homer H.

Charles ‘Hank’ Spaulding ’51  longtime MIT Corporation member  dies at 84,Charles “Hank” Spaulding ’51  a devoted alumnus and longtime member of the MIT Corporation  died Thursday  Nov. 24  in Kennebunk Beach  Maine. He was 84.Spaulding’s extensive service to the Corporation began in 1986  when he was elected as a term member; he was elected as a life member in 1991. Spaulding also served on the Corporation’s investment  development and auditing committees  and on visiting committees for the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  the MIT Libraries and the Department of Urban Studies and Planning.“Hank Spaulding … has contributed to and participated in the life of the Institute in just about every capacity one can imagine: student  alumni volunteer  founder of a center  adviser to a dean  Corporation member  visiting committee member and visiting committee chair ” President Emeritus Paul E. Gray said on March 1  2002  when Spaulding became a life member emeritus of the Corporation. “Over the course of 50 years  in one way or another  he has rarely been far from his alma mater.”Spaulding was born in Manchester  N.H.  on March 2  1927. The eldest of three children  he spent much of his free time behind the soda fountain at his father’s pharmacy and restaurant in Derry  N.H.  where he honed his entrepreneurial spirit.After earning his bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from MIT in 1951  Spaulding started his professional career designing and building bridges at Parsons Brinckerhoff. Several years later  he joined Boston-based real estate developer Cabot  Cabot & Forbes  where one of his first projects was developing a 7 000-acre ranch into the residential town of Laguna Niguel  Calif. He went on to become executive vice president and director at CC&F from 1963 to 1966  during which time the firm developed some of Boston’s iconic office towers and suburban industrial parks.In 1966 Spaulding co-founded Spaulding & Slye Corporation  a real estate development  brokerage  construction  property management and advisory services company that developed office properties in Boston; Washington; Charlotte  N.C.; and Oklahoma City. He led the company as president and then chairman until 1982.For the next three years  Spaulding worked closely with Jean de Monchaux  then dean of the School of Architecture and Planning  to establish MIT’s Center for Real Estate (CRE)  a graduate education and research program in real estate. Linking the disciplines of architecture  urban studies and planning  civil engineering  economics  and management  the CRE has become a model for similar programs at other universities. Spaulding served as CRE’s first chairman until 1985  when he stepped down to found Spaulding Investment Company.“Hank was a true visionary in his creation of the Center for Real Estate ” says Tony Ciochetti  Thomas G. Eastman Chair of the Center for Real Estate and professor of the practice of real estate at MIT. “Serious study of the field of real estate development was a unique undertaking that fit the mission of MIT very well. Combining the skills of business  planning  design  construction and economics  the MSRED program has influenced the lives of 780 graduates who have been instrumental in creating a better built environment in 26 countries around the world. Hank’s generosity to the Institute  the School of Architecture and Planning  and the Center for Real Estate demonstrate his fondness for ‘all things MIT.’”MIT paid tribute to Spaulding in 1986 with the Bronze Beaver — the highest honor given by the MIT Alumni Association for distinguished service — and in 1991 with the Marshall B. Dalton Class of 1915 Award  for extraordinary leadership in developing resources for the Institute.In addition to the MIT Corporation  Spaulding served on the boards of the Lahey Clinic  Pinkerton Academy  The Carroll School  the Kennebunk Beach Improvement Association and the Senior Center at Lower Village  which he co-founded with his wife.Spaulding is survived by his wife of 57 years  Ann Emerson Spaulding; sister Jean Rand and husband Dave  of Willimantic  Conn.; brother Richard Spaulding and wife Eleanor  of Lexington  Mass.; sons Rob Spaulding and wife Penny  of Kennebunk Beach  Maine; Scott Spaulding  of Newburyport  Mass.; Andy Spaulding and wife Chris  of Andover  Mass.; Jack Spaulding and wife Suzanne  of Portsmouth  N.H.; and Tom Spaulding and wife Mary  of Kensington  N.H.; daughters Jane Spaulding Breiby and husband E.J.  of Lexington  Mass.; and Sue Spaulding  of California; and eight grandchildren.Memorial contributions may be made to Gosnell Memorial Hospice House  c/o Hospice of Southern Maine  180 U.S. Route 1  Scarborough  ME  04074; or the Senior Center at Lower Village  175 Portland Road  Kennebunk  ME  04043.
David Staelin  longtime professor in EECS and RLE  dies at 73,David H. Staelin ’60  SM ’61  ScD ’65  a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics  died Nov. 10 of cancer. He was 73.Driven by a deeply felt sense of responsibility to MIT  the nation and society as a whole  Staelin dedicated his long career to basic science  technology development  service  education and entrepreneurship. His career  colleagues said  was distinguished by abundant accomplishments and widespread impact.Born and raised in Toledo  Ohio  Staelin came to MIT at age 18 as a freshman  in 1956  and remained at the Institute as a student and faculty member for the rest of his life.Staelin joined the MIT faculty in 1965  conducting research in radio astronomy. Among his first accomplishments  in 1968 he developed a computationally efficient algorithm that enabled him to co-discover the Crab Nebula Pulsar  helping confirm the existence of neutron stars predicted by theoretical physics.Over time  Staelin’s interests expanded to include remote sensing for climate monitoring  a field to which he brought a strong command of electromagnetics  signal-processing methodology and computation trends. Among many examples of his leadership in this field  he was principal investigator in the development of the first two Earth-orbiting microwave imaging spectrometers launched in 1975 for mapping global temperature and humidity through clouds. He was also a co-investigator on the 1977 NASA Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft missions  studying nonthermal radio emission from the outer planets. Starting in 1998  he co-developed techniques using operational millimeter-wave sounding satellites for more frequent and complete mapping of global precipitation.In recent years  Staelin turned his attention to diverse emerging problems requiring sophisticated signal processing and estimation theory. These included the development of practical image- and video-compression technology  advanced methodologies for data-rich manufacturing problems (which he pursued under the MIT Leaders for Manufacturing program)  heterogeneous and wireless communication architectures  and  most recently  neuronal computation models.Staelin was an active member of the MIT community  serving on numerous committees and in many leadership roles. From 1990 to 2001  he was assistant director of MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory  where he focused on enhancing the Laboratory’s long-range focus while strengthening its ties to the main MIT campus. He also served as a member of the U.S. President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003 to 2005.Staelin was a dedicated teacher who helped educate generations of electrical engineers. His focus for many years was the undergraduate electromagnetic curriculum. He co-authored the 1993 Prentice Hall textElectromagnetic Waveswith Ann W. Morgenthaler and Jin Au Kong.Colleagues recall Staelin as a thoughtful and patient mentor who was greatly loved and admired by his students. He supervised many doctoral  master’s and undergraduate student theses — almost 150 graduate theses alone — and a large number of alumni of his group have gone on to distinguished careers in academia and industry as researchers and scientists  entrepreneurs  technical leaders  and executives.Highly entrepreneurial  Staelin helped start and direct three companies with colleagues and students. The first was Environmental Research and Technology (now part of AECOM)  one of the first and largest environmental services companies  specializing initially in air quality and ultimately addressing the full spectrum of environmental issues. The second was PictureTel (now part of Polycom  itself founded by one of Staelin’s former students)  which pioneered cost-effective video-conferencing systems based on sophisticated video-compression technology that ultimately formed the basis for the ubiquitous video-compression standards that today enable the widespread availability of video content over networks. Staelin’s third effort was in the area of personal transportation  where he founded EMPower (purchased by ZAP)  which developed novel electric-scooter technology.Following these experiences  in 1998 Staelin co-founded MIT’s Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) to help early-stage MIT companies and aspiring MIT entrepreneurs benefit from the advice of experienced MIT alumni  and more generally to support entrepreneurial activity within the MIT community. VMS has served more than 1 000 companies to date  helping them raise almost $1 billion in capital  and has become a model for other similarly oriented university and government agencies.Staelin’s last project was a collaboration on neural computation with his son  Carl H. Staelin  which resulted in a monograph  currently in press  titledModels for Neural Spike Computation and Cognition.StaelinFest  an event held at MIT this past July to celebrate Staelin’s career  was attended by faculty  colleagues and former students from around the country. At the event  he also received the distinguished 2011 John Howard Dellinger Medal  awarded to him by the International Union of Radio Science for profound contributions to remote sensing over his career. Staelin was also a fellow of the IEEE and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Staelin’s instinctively self-effacing nature and his tendency to eschew the spotlight were in many ways the secret to his unusual effectiveness  colleagues say. Indeed  they add  he was the living embodiment of the maxim that you can accomplish a great deal in life if you don’t feel the need to take credit.Staelin is survived by his wife  Ellen; children Carl  Katharine and Paul; daughters-in-law Sigal and Jenny; grandchildren Alexander  Adam  Ella  Lauren  Steven and Claire; and siblings Earl  Stephen and Mimi Ferrell.A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday  Dec. 3  at 11 a.m. at the Unitarian-Universalist Society of Wellesley Hills  309 Washington St.  Wellesley  Mass. Visiting hours will be held Friday  Dec. 2  from 2-4 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. at the George F. Doherty & Sons Funeral Home  477 Washington St.  Wellesley  Mass.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to theDavid H. Staelin Fund  which supports graduate students conducting research in RLE.
Gobind Khorana  MIT professor emeritus  dies at 89,H. Gobind Khorana  MIT’s Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Biology and Chemistry emeritus  died of natural causes in Concord  Mass.  Wednesday morning. He was 89.A winner of the 1968 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine  Khorana devoted much of his scientific career to unraveling the genetic code and the mechanisms by which nucleic acids give rise to proteins. “Gobind was a brilliant  path-breaking scientist  a wise and considerate colleague  and a dear friend to many of us at MIT ” said Chris Kaiser  MacVicar Professor of Biology and head of the Department of Biology  in an email announcing the news to the department’s faculty.Khorana was born in India in 1922  in a small village called Raipur  in the region of Punjab that is now part of Pakistan. He was the youngest in a Hindu family of one daughter and four sons; his father was apatwari  an agricultural taxation clerk in the British Indian system of government. In an autobiographical note written upon winning the Nobel Prize  Khorana wrote: “Although poor  my father was dedicated to educating his children and we were practically the only literate family in the village inhabited by about 100 people.”Khorana attended high school in the nearby city of Multan before enrolling in Punjab University  where he received his bachelor’s degree in 1943 and master’s in 1945  both in chemistry and biochemistry. Upon graduating  he received a fellowship from the Indian government to study at the University of Liverpool in the U.K.  where he received his PhD in 1948.He did postdoctoral work at Switzerland’s Federal Institute of Technology  where he met his wife  the late Esther Elizabeth Sibler. Feeling lost in a new country  Khorana later wrote: “Esther brought a consistent sense of purpose in my life at a time when  after six years’ absence from the country of my birth  I felt out of place everywhere and at home nowhere.”After returning to the U.K. for another postdoc position in Cambridge  Khorana and his wife created a new home together in Vancouver  Canada  where he took a job at the British Columbia Research Council in 1952.“Gobind was so excited that he was going to start a lab of his own. He looked at the map of Canada  saw where Vancouver was for the first time  and off he went ” says colleague Uttam Rajbhandary  MIT’s Lester Wolfe Professor of Molecular Biology  recalling Khorana’s telling of how he accepted the position.Khorana stayed in Vancouver for eight years  continuing his pioneering work on proteins and nucleic acids while raising two daughters  Julia Elizabeth and Emily Anne  and a son  Dave Roy. In 1960  he went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison  where he became co-director of the Institute for Enzyme Research.It was at Wisconsin that Khorana and colleagues worked out the mechanisms by which RNA codes for the synthesis of proteins  leading to the Nobel Prize in 1968  which Khorana shared with Robert Holley of Cornell University and Marshall Nirenberg of the National Institutes of Health. Khorana was among the pioneers of the now-familiar series of three-nucleotide codons that signal to the cell which amino acids to use in building proteins — for example  uracil-cytosine-uracil  or UCU  codes for the amino acid serine  while CUC codes for leucine.After discovering this key biological code  Khorana became interested in replicating the process synthetically. In 1970 he joined MIT  where he continued at the forefront of the ballooning field of genetics.Shortly after arriving at the Institute  Khorana — along with colleagues — announced the synthesis of two different genes crucial to protein building. In a major breakthrough in 1976  they managed to complete the synthesis of the first fully functional manmade gene in a living cell. This method of chemically synthesizing genes made possible controlled  systematic studies of how genetic structure influences function.In the decades that followed  Khorana became interested in other cellular components  including biomembranes and  in the visual system  rhodopsin — the pigment on the eye’s retina that is responsible for the first step in the biological perception of light. He retired from the MIT faculty in 2007.In addition to his strong research ethic  Khorana took pride in mentoring younger scientists. “Even while doing all this research  he was always really interested in education  in students and young people ” says his daughter  Julia Khorana ’75. “After he retired  students would come to visit and he loved to talk to them about the work they were doing. He was very loyal to them  and they were very loyal to him  too.”Rajbhandary says he will remember Khorana for his drive and focus  but also his humility. “As good as he was  he was one of the most modest people I have known ” he says. “What he accomplished in his life  coming from where he did  is truly incredible.”In addition to the Nobel  Khorana won many other professional awards  including the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University and the Lasker Foundation Award for Basic Medical Research  both in 1968; the Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago section of the American Chemical Society  in 1974; the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award  in 1980; and the Paul Kayser International Award of Merit in Retina Research  in 1987. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  among other distinguished professional memberships.Khorana is survived by his daughter  Julia  and son  Dave. A memorial service is being planned.
Remembering Satto Tonegawa,Satto Tonegawa  an MIT freshman  passed away two weeks ago in his MacGregor House dorm room. He was 18.Tonegawa  of Chestnut Hill  Mass.  was born on Oct. 30  1992. He attended Milton Academy in Milton  Mass.  graduating cum laude before arriving at the Institute as a first-year student this fall.MIT Chancellor Eric Grimson said of his death  “This is profoundly sad  and the entire MIT community shares a deep sense of loss and grief.”A talented scientist and musician  Tonegawa identified strongly with his Japanese-American heritage. His parents  Susumu and Mayumi Tonegawa  say they will remember their son as a person of “profound intelligence  modesty and elegance  with a gentle and infectious smile and generous sense of humor ” who  in his short life  “deeply touched those around him.”A spirited scientistTonegawa’s mother says teachers remarked that Tonegawa was a happy-go-lucky kid who happened to be an academic superstar. The preschooler who dribbled sugar-cookie crumbs alongside a trail of ants to observe their ensuing behavior grew into a young man fascinated by the workings of the universe  from molecular biology to astrophysics.At Milton Academy  Tonegawa impressed those around him with his intelligence and drive. During his senior year  he fashioned himself an independent study course  using materials from MIT OpenCourseWare to delve into advanced concepts in molecular biology and biochemistry.Arriving at the Institute  Tonegawa was especially excited about pursuing biology coursework  although those who knew him say he had a flair for most any discipline  including physics. His mother remembers a time  as she was driving her 16-year-old son home from school  when he asked her if she knew Maxwell’s equations — the laws that govern electromagnetism and the speed of light. She said she had learned them as a freshman at MIT but had forgotten the details.“Satto then recited all the equations  moving me to say  ‘Wow  you memorized all those — impressive!’” Mayumi Tonegawa recalls. “He said  ‘Mom  it isn’t that. Once you understand well what they mean  you don’t have to memorize them.’” That  she says  was when she realized “his brain belonged to a different category altogether.”Emotion and logicAn accomplished musician in two instruments — piano and cello — Tonegawa resisted pressure to specialize in one or the other as he got older. “We asked him  ‘Why not drop an instrument?’” his mother says. “Satto replied  ‘When I am playing cello  the emotional side of my brain is fully at work. I am very emotional. With piano  I am very cool  and the logical side of my brain is hard at work  no matter how emotional the piece is.’”After taking first place in piano among thousands of students nationwide at the 2009 American Fine Arts Festival  Tonegawa was invited to play at Carnegie Hall  where he performed a Rachmaninoff piece that “elated the entire audience ” his mother recalls.During the summer of 2010  prior to his senior year of high school  Tonegawa worked as an intern in the lab of Alexander van Oudenaarden  MIT’s W.M. Keck Career Development Professor of Physics and Biology  where he took part in a study of a genetic circuit that controls neuronal migration. Van Oudenaarden says Tonegawa displayed an aptitude for research beyond his years.“It was amazing to see how he fit into the lab so smoothly ” van Oudenaarden says. “He was working at a level of an experienced researcher. He was also a very nice guy. Very funny  amazingly talented.”Van Oudenaarden adds  “I was shocked  and the lab was really shocked — and sad — to hear the news.”Tonegawa is survived by his father  Susumu Tonegawa  recipient of the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience at MIT; his mother  Mayumi Tonegawa ’92; two older siblings  brother Hidde ’09 and sister Hanna; and extended family. The family is planning a private memorial service to be held at their home.
Robert Silbey  former MIT dean of science  dies at 71,Robert J. Silbey  who served as dean of MIT’s School of Science from 2000 to 2007  died Thursday  Oct. 27  after a battle with cancer. He was 71.Silbey was known for his leadership and political acumen as dean  his commitment to enhancing MIT’s education and research  and his work in condensed phase theory and quantum biology  fields that he helped to pioneer.“Bob Silbey was a total citizen of MIT ” said Charles Vest  president of MIT from 1990 to 2004. “He was a first-rate scientist  an excellent teacher  a skillful administrator and a caring steward of the MIT student experience. As chemistry department head and dean of science  he built bridges across disciplines and brought a strong sense of humanity as well as a great sense of humor to his work. Although he never sought the limelight  he has left a big legacy at the Institute and will be greatly missed.”Silbey joined the MIT faculty in 1966  becoming head of the chemistry department in 1990 and director of the Center for Materials Science and Engineering in 1998. He took over as interim dean in February 2000 and was named permanent dean the following year.Robert Brown  who appointed Silbey dean while serving as MIT’s provost  said Silbey was “one of the most talented academic leaders I have ever had the honor of working with. He led by example through his own dedication to teaching  research and the success of MIT’s students  and he had the unique ability to work calmly through the most difficult issues and get agreement from strong-willed colleagues on a way forward.”Brown  now president of Boston University  added that Silbey also “brought a sense of optimism and a little levity to the difficult day-to-day work of deans and provosts.”“His way of bringing people together through his humorous stories made him beloved by his colleagues ” said Sylvia Ceyer  the John C. Sheehan Professor of Chemistry and chair of the Department of Chemistry. “He was a generous colleague  personally and scientifically  giving of his time  energy and brilliant mind to us.”An advocate for excellence in teaching  Silbey supported innovative approaches to undergraduate education such as the Technology Enhanced Active Learning program  which changed the way freshman physics is taught. He also oversaw the construction of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Complex  and during his tenure as dean  four Nobel Prizes were awarded to School of Science faculty members.Another of Silbey’s priorities was improving the experiences of women and underrepresented minorities on the faculty.“In producing the historic report  ‘A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT ’” Ceyer said  “Silbey played the critical role in obtaining the empirical data substantiating the women’s concerns and beginning the process of amelioration.”Catherine Drennan  a professor of chemistry  said Silbey offered critical support in creating a welcoming environment for female and minority students.“He was always seeking new opportunities to make MIT and the field of science better for everybody ” Drennan said. He enthusiastically began a new collaboration between chemistry and biological engineering in the teaching of thermodynamics.Silbey was known as a caring mentor  and many of his students have gone on to positions of leadership in academia.“After his remarkable service as dean  Bob Silbey continued to serve the Institute in extraordinary ways ” said MIT President Susan Hockfield. “He saw  in many dimensions  how MIT could grow stronger  and he committed himself to making that vision real  with brilliance  pragmatism and always his light touch.”Silbey was a consummate teacher who received almost every teaching award MIT bestows  including the School of Science Teaching Award  the Graduate Student Council Award for Teaching and the Baker Award for Undergraduate Teaching (voted by the undergraduates). In 1996  he was named a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow  an honor that recognizes outstanding classroom teaching at MIT.Drennan  who co-taught freshman chemistry with Silbey many years ago  said it was impossible to improve on his lectures. “He commanded that room with his voice  his presentation and his personality ” she recalled.A former undergraduate in Silbey’s thermodynamics class  Justin Cohen ’03  wrote  “I still fondly look back on that class  and I can honestly say that although I may have forgotten quite a bit of material  I still remember the joy  energy and excitement that all of us felt when Professor Silbey was teaching … his energy  passion and friendliness made you feel as though you had known him forever.”Silbey made fundamental contributions to the theories of spectroscopy  energy transfer and nonlinear optical properties of glasses  solids and polymers. In the 1980s  Silbey showed how the high conductivity of conjugated polymers arose from chain distortion induced by excitations. This work provided the first quantum calculations of the soliton  polaron and bipolaron entities that dominate polymers' conductivity. His work also provided the first quantum method capable of predicting the redox potentials of these polymers  explaining a large amount of existing experimental data in hole burning  photon echo and single molecule spectroscopies  thereby spurring many new experiments.“It is well known among the scientific community that Silbey was an experimentalist’s theorist ” Ceyer said.Most recently  Silbey’s research focused on energy transfer and quantum dynamics in the context of photosynthesis — the process that plants use to convert the sun’s energy into sugar. His work was particularly relevant to the first step of photosynthesis  which involves the capture of photons by light-harvesting pigments and the subsequent transfer of the photon’s energy to structures within plant cells that convert it to chemical energy.To predict how fast excitation energy could be transferred  Silbey developed a wide range of theoretical methods that have now become the standard techniques for studying photosynthetic energy transfer. One example is the variational polaron transformation  which describes how quantum friction can slow down the motion of excitation energy. A paper by Silbey and Robert Harris of the University of California at Berkeley on this approach  one of most cited in physical chemistry  is a classic  according to Jianshu Cao  MIT professor of chemistry.“With this and other powerful tools  Bob Silbey and his team predicted the dynamics of energy excitations in conjugated polymers and other organic molecules important for solar cells ” Cao said. “These studies laid a solid foundation for the current investigation of quantum biology.”Born in Brooklyn  N.Y.  Silbey received a bachelor of science from Brooklyn College in 1961 and a PhD in theoretical physical chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1965. He then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin for a year before joining the MIT faculty in 1966.He was a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society. He was awarded the Max Planck Research Award of the Humboldt Foundation  and was a Dreyfus Foundation Teacher Scholar  Sloan Foundation Fellow and a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow. He also received  among other awards  honorary degrees from his alma mater  CUNY Brooklyn College  and École Normale Supérieure in Cachan  France.Silbey is survived by his wife  Susan  the Leon and Anne Goldberg Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at MIT; daughters Jessica and Anna; sons-in-law Keith Dresser and Jeffrey Thompson; brother Joel and sister-in-law Rosemary; sister-in-law and brother-in-law Alma and Dick Merians; nieces Victoria Silbey and Diane Merians; nephews David Silbey and Roger Merians; and four grandchildren: Charlotte Silbey Dresser  Harper Silbey Dresser  Henry Hardy Thompson-Silbey and Oliver Harold Thompson-Silbey.A Robert J. Silbey Memorial Fund has been established at MIT in his memory. Donations can be sent to the MIT provost’s office. A memorial celebration will occuron March 17  2012 from 2-4 p.m. in Building 46.
Jane Phillips  employee in Office of Vice President for Finance  dies at 65,Jane Phillips  an employee in accounts payable within the Office of the Vice President for Finance (VPF)  died on Monday  Oct. 10  in Boston  Mass. She was 65.Phillips began working at MIT as a temporary employee in several departments  including the registrar’s office and accounts payable  between 1994 and 1996. She joined accounts payable full time as an accounts payable assistant in 1997 and served in that role until she went on medical leave during spring 2011.Phillips had a bachelor’s degree in economics from Barnard College and held positions in teaching and market research prior to joining MIT.She was a loving wife and mother and a valued colleague and friend to many across the Institute. She will be deeply missed.
Lee Davenport  researcher at the Radiation Laboratory during World War II  dies at 95,Lee L. Davenport  who worked at MIT’s Radiation Laboratory during World War II and has been credited with helping to bring an end to the war  died of cancer on Sept. 30 at the Nathaniel Witherell Nursing Center. He was 95.Davenport received a BS from Union College in 1937  and an MS in 1940 and his PhD in physics in 1946 from the University of Pittsburgh. From 1940 to the end of World War II  Davenport was a research fellow at theRadiation Laboratoryat MIT  developing the revolutionary antiaircraft system known as microwave radar or SCR-584 (Signal Corp Radio #584)  which helped save England from V1 buzz bombs. The SCR-584 went on to play an important part on the battlefields of both the European and Pacific theaters.After the war  Davenport received his doctorate for his design for remote controling a missile over a radar beam without being taken over by an enemy  which was effectively the first guided missile and precursor of today's drones.From 1946-1950  Davenport served as research fellow at Harvard University with responsibility for the nuclear lab and building of a 92-inch cyclotron that was then the second largest atom smasher in the world. He also taught physics at Radcliffe College during his time at Harvard. He later went on to work for Perkin-Elmer Corp  where he would retire from in 1980.He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1973 for his original contribution to the development of radar  infrared analytical instrumentation  and his leadership in the development of communications technology. He was also a member of the American Physics SocietyA memorial service to celebrate the life of Lee Davenport will be held on Oct. 22  at 2 p.m. at the First Congregational Church  108 Sound Beach Avenue in Old Greenwich  CT 06870. In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the First Congregational Church or to The Nathaniel Witherell Rehabilitation and Nursing Center  70 Parsonage Road  Greenwich  CT 06830. Funeral arrangements are by Fred D. Knapp & Son Funeral Home.
Sir William R. Hawthorne  former professor of mechanical engineering  dies at 98,Sir William R. Hawthorne  a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT from the mid-1940s to the early 1950s who was a pioneer of jet engine technology  died of pneumonia in Cambridge  England  on Friday  Sept. 16. He was 98.Deemed a “sparkling” personality by students and colleagues alike  Hawthorne  who was knighted in 1970 by Queen Elizabeth II  made numerous contributions in advancing jet-engine and gas-turbine technology. Throughout his career  Hawthorne  who was born in Benton  England  made a point of forging ties between his two alma maters  the University of Cambridge and MIT  a collaboration that still exists today.Hawthorne graduated from Cambridge in 1934 with a Bachelor of Arts degree  and spent a year as an apprentice at the manufacturing firm Babcock and Wilcox Ltd.  before heading across the Atlantic to MIT.It was here  in “the other Cambridge ” where Hawthorne received an ScD in chemical engineering and worked up a thesis  “The Mixing of Gas and Air in Flames ” in which he studied burning jets of combustible gas. While most researchers assumed gas would burn completely as long as there was enough free oxygen  Hawthorne found that in fast-burning fires  the flames contained eddies of unburned  gaseous fuel along with free oxygen.Hawthorne’s work at MIT proved useful after graduation  as he was called back to England during World War II. There  as he liked to say  Hawthorne “was loaned” to Sir Frank Whittle  known as the father of jet propulsion. Hawthorne and Whittle worked on the country’s development of jet aircraft; Hawthorne drew from his thesis work at MIT to design a fuel mixture for fast combustion. Together  he and Whittle engineered the combustion chambers for the first British jet engine ever to fly.Cambridge-to-CambridgeAfter the war  Hawthorne jumped back across the Atlantic — something he would continue to do throughout his career — returning to MIT first as an associate professor  then as the George Westinghouse Professor of Mechanical Engineering.From 1946 to 1951  Hawthorne devoted his research to gas turbines. Specifically  he identified an effect called secondary flow  a phenomenon in gas turbines in which air flows in a different direction from the primary flow  particularly at bends or turns in the system. Hawthorne’s observations ultimately helped engineers increase the efficiency of airflow within gas turbines.In 1951  Hawthorne accepted a position at Cambridge as a professor of applied thermodynamics  though his ties with MIT remained. In 1955  MIT made Hawthorne the first Hunsacker Professor of Aeronautics  a visiting professorship established in honor of Jerome Hunsacker  then an MIT professor of aeronautics.In subsequent years  Hawthorne made frequent trips to MIT as a visiting Institute Professor and as a visitor to the MIT Gas Turbine Laboratory  where he had a major role in guiding the work of a number of students  faculty and research staff.In the late 1950s  spurred by the oil shortage following the Suez Crisis  Hawthorne turned his attention to designing an alternative fuel-transportation system. Instead of conventional  hulking oil tankers  Hawthorne proposed collapsible barges — long  sausage-shaped tubes that could be filled with fuel and dragged by a small boat. He coined the vessels “dracones ” Greek for “dragon” or “sea serpent.” Today  dracone barges are used to transport fuel to locations that lack deepwater docks  as well as to clean up oil spills.In recognition of his many contributions  Hawthorne was elected a member of the Royal Society and a foreign associate of both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences.Hawthorne’s strong ties to MIT extended beyond academia. He married Barbara Runkle  the granddaughter of John Daniel Runkle  who served as MIT’s second president from 1870 to 1878; his grandson  Charles Amick  recently graduated from the Institute.Keeping the connectionEd Greitzer  the H.N. Slater Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics  remembers one of Hawthorne’s particularly pivotal visits to MIT  when Greitzer was himself a graduate student at Harvard University. At the time  Greitzer was deciding whether to pursue a career in industry. A conversation with Hawthorne  then a consultant to Pratt & Whitney  convinced him to join the company.A number of years later  further interactions with Hawthorne led Greitzer to rejoin academia  first for a year at Cambridge and then at MIT  where he continued to seek counsel from Hawthorne  who urged him to reach out and work with partners at Cambridge. “He said that MIT and Cambridge working together offered opportunities and advantages for both  and that we should keep the tradition going ” Greitzer says. “And so we did  from the 1970s to the present.”A high point of that effort came in 2006  when researchers from MIT and Cambridge reported their work on the Silent Aircraft Initiative  a project to design an airplane that would be virtually noiseless outside the perimeter of an urban airport.“Sir William was an example of what being a professional is all about ” Greitzer adds. “He was really rigorous in going about technical work.”Into thin airThe same could be said for Hawthorne’s approach to one of his favorite pastimes: the art of conjuring. A longtime fan of magic  Hawthorne always had a trick up his sleeve; Greitzer remembers many occasions when Hawthorne would perform such illusions with flourish and style. In fact  Hawthorne was elected president of the Pentacle Club at Cambridge  one of the oldest magician societies in the world  holding the post from 1970 to 1990. After years of practice  he finally achieved a long-sought illusion: that of sawing a woman in half.In 1993  Greitzer and his colleagues held an 80th birthday party for Hawthorne at MIT  where the guest of honor humored his friends with several magic tricks.  “I remember sitting in the first row and watching very carefully to see how he did it ” Greitzer recalls. “And I just couldn’t. He did it that well.”A funeral will take place at 2 p.m. on Sept. 29 in Cambridge  England  at The Chapel at Churchill College  with a reception following at Trinity College.A memorial service will take place at the MIT Chapel  48 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139  on Saturday  March 24  2012  at 2 p.m. A reception will follow at the MIT Student Center  next door to the Chapel  in Room W20-307.

Celebrating the life of Nicolas E. Del Castillo,Nicolas E. Del Castillo  an MIT sophomore  was found deceased last weekend in his East Campus dorm room. He was 18.MIT Chancellor Eric Grimson called Del Castillo’s death “a tragedy for the MIT community.” A memorial Mass will be held Sunday  Sept. 11  at 5 p.m. in the MIT Chapel.Del Castillo  a native of Bogotá  Colombia  was born Aug. 13  1993  and attended the Colegio Calasanz de Bogotá before arriving at the Institute as a freshman in fall 2010. His parents  Henry Del Castillo and Sandra Muñoz  say that in his relatively short life  their son “left footprints” in the lives of many people both at home and abroad.“He was a good son  a good brother  a good student  a good teacher ” Muñoz says. “Everyone who knew him had a great deal of respect for him.”Del Castillo had been planning to major in math at MIT  where he excelled in his freshman year courses. His family and friends say he was a kind  self-motivated young man who held himself to high standards and lived his life with an exceptional degree of integrity.“He didn’t care much about style or external appearances ” says Maria Paula Quiroga  a cousin of Del Castillo’s. “He never did anything for any kind of reward — he just did it because he loved it.”A multitalented mathematicianFor his part  Henry Del Castillo recalls a scene as he was driving his son  then 8 years old  to a karate lesson: “He asked me  ‘Papi  is there a mathematical way to determine all the prime numbers?’ I told him that’s a problem that mathematicians have been working on for years and years. And he said  ‘I’m going to solve it.’”“He was always a scientist ” Muñoz adds. “When he was a little boy  he was always out on the patio doing experiments with water  soil  bottles  whatever he could get his hands on.”Del Castillo began competing in math Olympiads in elementary school  quickly rising to the top of whatever level he was placed in. He traveled to Argentina  Mexico and Germany with the Colombian national team. But for all his accolades  teammates  coaches and competitors knew Del Castillo as an extremely humble  giving person.“He wanted to help others. If someone didn’t understand  he would say  ‘Come here  I’ll explain it to you ’” his father recalls. “He believed that science belonged to everyone.”For all his intellectual gifts  Del Castillo actively pursued hobbies outside mathematics and the sciences. In addition to karate  he was an artist who enjoyed origami and music. His family says he taught himself to play keyboard simply by reading the sheet music  joining his school’s orchestra without ever taking a single lesson.“He could have done anything  because he was good at all of it ” Quiroga says.‘The launching point’Muñoz says the day her son learned of his acceptance to MIT was an extremely proud moment for the entire community. “Nicolas was the launching point for so many other students at his school — he was like a springboard ” she says. “Other kids saw him do it and they wanted to do it  too.”What’s more  Del Castillo wanted to help them. Most recently  he spent his summer at home in Bogotá  training aspiring mathematicians to represent Colombia at the International Math Olympiad.At the Institute  Del Castillo was known as a considerate  hard-working member of the East Campus community. Though he was often reserved  he nevertheless impressed his professors and peers with his intellect and perspicacity.“He was less outspoken than some students. He was a bit shy  but whenever he spoke people would listen  because they knew he really had something to say ” says Diana Henderson  a professor in MIT’s literature section who taught Del Castillo in her Writing with Shakespeare class last fall.When Henderson surveyed Del Castillo’s classmates from the course  many remembered an occasion in which he was thrust unexpectedly into the spotlight and impressed them with his talent. While acting out scenes  a student who was supposed to play a crucial role backed out at the last minute; Del Castillo stepped in to take over the part. “He memorized the speech so well and performed it with such passion that they all said he was the best actor in the class ” Henderson recalls.“Everyone is shocked and very sad to lose him ” Henderson adds. “He will be sorely missed.”In addition to his parents  Del Castillo is survived by a 13-year-old sister  Cindy Lorena  and other members of his extended family.
MIT professor emeritus Yao Tzu Li dies at 97,Yao Tzu Li  professor emeritus in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and co-founder of the MIT Man-Vehicle Laboratory  passed away suddenly Sunday  Aug. 14  of an aortic aneurysm. He was 97.An energetic innovator and educator  Li encouraged students to explore their entrepreneurial spirit. In 1973  Li established the MIT Innovation Center  a program designed to shepherd students through the process of innovation  from developing an idea to engineering a prototype to marketing a product.“It is a common belief that inventors and [entrepreneurs] are self-made men  born with that talent. Edison  the Wright brothers — none attended college ” Li told The Associated Press in 1973  shortly after launching the program. “But with limits on natural resources  environmental concern and the shrinking U.S. share of the world market  we simply cannot rely upon the self-breeding process of a few innovators to keep the rest of the educated engineers employed. What we need is an organized training ground for innovators and entrepreneurs.”Li was born in Peking on Feb. 1  1914. After earning a bachelor’s degree from Peking University and a master’s degree from Central University in China  Li continued his studies in aeronautical engineering at MIT  where he received a master’s degree in 1938 and an ScD in 1939.Shortly after earning his doctorate  Li returned to China  where he joined the Chinese Air Force as a chief engineer. In this capacity  Li oversaw the construction and operation of an airplane-engine manufacturing plant in Guizhou Province that was then being built underground. From 1945 to 1946  Li worked with the Chinese government to further advance aircraft technology  heading up development of the country’s first homegrown aircraft engine.In 1947  Li made his way back to MIT  where he became a research associate in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. From 1953 to 1957  Li directed the MIT Cruise Control Project in the Aerophysics Laboratory  where he worked with Charles Stark Draper to develop an automatic optimization system for the B-52 bomber.Li became a full professor at MIT in 1961; around that time Draper paired him with a newly appointed assistant professor  Larry Young  to launch the Man-Vehicle Laboratory. Together  the two investigated the effects of air and space travel on human passengers  winning a grant from NASA to study the phenomenon of space sickness — particularly for astronauts in the early Apollo program.Young  now the Apollo Program Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics  remembers Li as a generous mentor and friend  and a born inventor. Young recalls a particular weekend in the 1960s when the two took a break from work to go skiing; Li had asked Young  an avid skier  for a lesson.“We went up to Mount Sunapee … on a Friday ” Young says. By Monday  “he had gotten a pair of skis and had modified them by attaching an I-bolt to the back of the ski  and a little steel cable that went from the back of the ski up to a kind of harness up around his lower leg  so when he would lean forward  the ski would bend.”The invention made turning easier: A skier would otherwise have to hop to switch directions  to prevent the back of the skis from catching in the snow. With Li’s contraption  a skier would simply have to lean into the turn.“Only in the ’90s did the ski racers and ski manufacturers discover the ease and grace  as well as the speed  of the turn-by-leaning technique ” Young says. Li’s design “was foretelling the evolution of skis by a decade or more.”Throughout his career  Li was a prolific inventor  with more than 60 patents to his name. In addition to patents for aircraft optimization systems and pressure indicators for rocket engines  Li patented designs for an archery bow and a tennis racket with flexibly anchored strings.In 1972  shortly before launching the MIT Innovation Center  Li made national headlines with a particularly entrepreneurial idea: a scheme  as aBoston Globearticle put it  to “tackle the tilt” of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The idea started as a joke — Li made light of the tower’s tilt with his children  after hearing about the problem in the news. The joke turned into a project during a European tour  when Li dined with a professor then in charge of saving the tower.Li came up with a blueprint to keep the tower from toppling  involving a ring of concrete pads surrounding the base of the tower to redistribute pressure and support the tower’s weight. The plan never gained traction  but Li  ever the entrepreneur  was unfazed. He simply moved on to his next project.“He had an incredible way of looking at complex mechanical problems and getting to the heart of them ” Young recalls. “He was not inhibited by the conventional way of doing things.”Li was predeceased in 2004 by his wife of 56 years  Nancy Tung Tuan Lin. He is survived by four children — Winifred and her husband William Oliver of Weston Mass.; Karl and his wife Wei Xu of Millwood  N.Y.; Kenneth and his wife Valerie Ng of Piedmont  Calif.; and Wendy and her husband Jonathan Spector of Weston  Mass. — and 11 grandchildren: Jeffries  Parker and Alisan Oliver-Li; Lindsay  Nicholas  Jason and Jasmine Li; and Daniel  Michael  William and Benjamin Spector. He is also survived by his brother S.Y. and sister-in-law Lena Lee  as well as numerous cousins  in-laws  nieces and nephews.A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday  Sept. 3  in the MIT Memorial Chapel. In lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to the Yao T. Li (1938) Fellowship Fund  care of Bonny Kellermann  MIT Director of Memorial Gifts  600 Memorial Drive (W98-500)  Cambridge  Mass.  02139.

Robert Rathbone  MIT professor emeritus  dies at 95,Robert R. Rathbone  MIT professor emeritus in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies  passed away in Brunswick  Maine  on Feb. 23. He was 95.RRR  as he was fondly known in the former Department of Humanities  was a prolific author of communication textbooks and articles  and helped develop the field of professional communication studies in the 1950s. He was one of the founders and the first director of MIT's writing program in 1976  and he worked extensively with faculty throughout the Institute to integrate communication instruction into the undergraduate science and engineering curriculum.A 1939 graduate of Middlebury College  Rathbone was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve  where he served as a communications officer from 1942-46 in the Commander  Destroyers  Atlantic Fleet at Casco Bay  Maine  eventually becoming the director of the Officers Communication School. In 1948  after earning a master's in English at Harvard University  he was hired by then-professor Jay Forrester as a technical writer in the Digital Computer Laboratory for Project Whirlwind at MIT. There  he edited research papers  developed a speaking clinic and wrote public information notes  including co-authoring a script on the digital computer that served as the basis for a feature on Edward R. Murrow's “See It Now” television series.Along with fellow writer-editor Joseph Ulman  Rathbone inaugurated the teaching of professional engineering communication in the Department of Humanities and collaborative communication instruction in the School of Engineering. He was appointed assistant professor of English in the Department of Humanities in 1953  promoted to associate professor in 1957  and then to professor of technical writing in 1969. He was the head of publications for Division 6 of Lincoln Laboratory from 1953-56 and the writer/editor for MIT’s Division of Sponsored Research from 1956-67. From 1953-78  he also served as the director of a popular summer program  Communicating Technical Information  which drew an international attendance.Rathbone was the author and co-author of several volumes on professional communication  includingA Writer's Guide for Engineers and Scientists(1962) and the popularCommunicating Technical Information(1972). He retired in 1979 and lived for many years in New Hampshire and then Maine  where he devoted himself to his pastimes of working in local historical societies  bird watching  painting and ham radio operation.
Jerome Lettvin  MIT professor emeritus  dies at 91,Jerome Lettvin  an MIT professor emeritus of electrical and bioengineering and communications physiology known for his revolutionary paper “What the frog’s eye tells the frog’s brain ” died in Hingham  Mass.  on April 23. He was 91.After its publication in 1959  while Lettvin was a researcher at MIT  “What the frog’s eye tells the frog’s brain” quickly became one of the most cited papers in the Science Citation Index. In it  Lettvin and his co-authors made the first demonstration of “feature detectors” — the idea that specific neurons respond to specific features of a visual stimulus  including edges and contrast  curvature  movement and changes in light levels. They went so far as to describe certain frog retinal fibers as “bug detectors ” groups of cells that respond preferentially to small  dark objects that enter the visual field  stop  and then move around intermittently. Though it met with skepticism at first  the idea has had a profound and lasting impact on the fields of neuroscience  physiology and cognition.In addition to his work on vision  Lettvin carried out many important studies of the neurophysiology of the spinal cord and information processing in nerve cell axons. Though he is best known for his work in neurology and physiology  he also published on philosophy  politics and poetry.Early life and educationLettvin  popularly known as “Jerry ” was born in Chicago on Feb. 23  1920  to Ukrainian immigrant parents. In an autobiography written for the Society for Neuroscience  he called his Humboldt Park surroundings “materially poor but culturally rich” — indeed  Lettvin had his heart set on being a poet before his mother made the “irrevocable decision” that he was to be a doctor.After high school  he began taking classes at the Lewis Institute before spending a year at the University of Chicago  where he met his longtime friend and collaborator  mathematician Walter Pitts. He earned both a BS and MD in 1943 from the University of Illinois  where he trained as a neurologist and psychiatrist.After serving as a doctor in World War II  Lettvin had appointments at the University of Rochester and the Manteno State Hospital in Illinois  gradually transitioning from clinical practice to physiology research. He came to MIT in 1951 under Jerry Wiesner  then-director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics  who later served as MIT president. Along with Lettvin  Wiesner also hired Pitts and Warren McCulloch  and in doing so  assembled what would become a prolific team of neurophysiology researchers.A master of debateLettvin was known for his remarkable debate skills  and would engage in well-reasoned argumentation with anyone on any topic  often extemporaneously. He would take any side  and believed that “if you can’t argue your opponent’s position  you have no right to your own argument ” his son  Jonathan  recalls.In 1967  Lettvin took on powerful pro-drug figure Timothy Leary in a famous debate on the merits of LSD. In response to Leary’s claim that LSD offered its users a needed escape and gave rise to visionary and religious experiences  Lettvin argued that LSD was immoral because unlike lighter drugs  its users were more likely to be sucked in against their will  unable to break the cycle of living in an altered reality. He said: “The kick is cheap. The ecstasy is cheap. And you are settling for a permanently second-rate world by the complete abrogation of the intellect.”Incredibly  Lettvin entered the debate with no advance preparation  as the professor originally scheduled to debate Leary had cancelled at the last minute  and the organizers struggled to find a replacement. “They came to his office as a last resort; he was up to his shirtsleeves in an experiment  but he walked right over and did it ” Jonathan Lettvin says.The event received much attention from television and the press; The Boston Globe and many other sources extolled Lettvin‘s performance. Replays were used in high school anti-drug programs across the country.In a tribute to Lettvin on his 60th birthday  William Pickard  a postdoc working with Lettvin in the 1950s  wrote: “Jerry has an unparalleled and unperturbable ability to think on his feet; and  having thought  to mesmerize an audience with his conclusions.”Science and service at MITAt MIT  Lettvin was renowned for being an outstanding mentor and a very energetic lecturer. Of his history of science class  his wife  Maggie  recalled: “He’d go in there and talk for three or four hours and the kids would bring their girlfriends  lunches  and just sit there forever.”He and Maggie served as housemasters of the Bexley Hall dorm in the late 1960s and early 1970s  a time that was “both enlivening and exhausting” for them  he wrote in his autobiography. He was also one of the early directors of the Concourse Program  a freshman learning community that bridges the humanities and the sciences by exploring connections between disciplines such as literature and physics  or history and mathematics.His approach to science often involved making observations that challenged key theoretical assumptions. In a 2007 interview  Lettvin said: “I’m a garbage picker-upper as a mode of science: I focus on the garbage truck. I look at the parts that others choose not to pay attention to.” He encouraged his students to ask difficult questions  to “tear apart what is already accepted.”Lettvin is survived by his wife  Maggie; his three children  David  Ruth and Jonathan; and his six grandchildren. A memorial service is being planned; for more information contactGill Pratt’83  SM ’87  PhD ’89  a former MIT associate professor and former graduate student of Lettvin’s.
Longtime Corporation member John Haas  SM ’42  dies at 92,John Haas SM ’42  who for 24 years was an active member of the MIT Corporation and still retained the status of life member emeritus  died Saturday  April 2  at his home in Villanova  Pa. He was 92.After graduating from Amherst College  Haas earned a master’s degree in chemical engineering at MIT. Having enlisted in the Naval Reserves  he worked briefly for the chemical company his father had co-founded  Rohm and Haas  before being called to active duty in 1942. Discharged from the Navy in 1946  he returned to Rohm and Haas as a process engineer and  later  as an assistant plant manager in Knoxville  Tenn.  and Houston  Texas. Although he met Chara Cooper  his future wife  at a dinner party in Houston  she  like him  was a native of the Philadelphia area.According to his profile on the Rohm and Haas website  Haas felt that during his four years in the Navy  he had fallen behind on the rapid advances in the field of chemical engineering  so he moved into what he described as the “people side of the business.” In 1953  the year after he and Cooper married  he was named vice president of personnel at Rohm and Haas. In 1959  he became vice chairman of the board and in 1974 chairman.Haas joined the MIT Corporation as a term member in 1965  and during two five-year terms  he chaired both the Chemistry and the Chemical Engineering Committees. He became a life member in 1975  and in 1987  one of his family trusts endowed the Haas Family Fellowship in the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice. Two years later  he stepped down from active service to the Corporation  becoming a life member emeritus.Throughout his life  Haas was a noted philanthropist. In 1960  when his father died  he began a 32-year tenure as chair of the charitable foundation — now the William Penn Foundation — that his parents had established in 1945. In 2009  when Dow Chemical bought Rohm and Haas for more than $15 billion  the family shifted $747 million to the Penn Foundation  as part of $1.25 billion in bequests to four charitable trusts.Haas was also a major supporter of the United Way and the Boys and Girls Clubs  among other organizations. In 2009  he converted a 160-acre property that had been in his family since 1928 into a nature conservancy  the Brandywine Conservancy  augmenting the bequest with another 200-acre property he and his wife had bought in 1968.After Haas’s death  Ed Rendell  the two-term governor of Pennsylvania  was quoted in the digital edition ofThe Philadelphia Inquireras calling Haas “a gentle  extraordinarily decent and honorable man.” “If you met him for the first time  you would never have guessed he was extremely successful ” Rendell continued. “He didn't care much for the trappings of wealth or success. He only cared about using his resources to help others.” Indeed  according to the5  Haas was known to his neighbors as “the spry old man who roamed the local roads picking up litter.”In addition to his wife  Haas is survived by a daughter  Barbara; four sons  David  Leonard  Frederick and Duncan; and 10 grandchildren. A public memorial service is being planned.Contributions in his memory may be made to the Boys and Girls Club of Philadelphia  attn. Development Dept.  1518 Walnut St.  Suite 605  Philadelphia PA 19102  or to the United Way of Southeastern Pennsylvania  1709 Benjamin Franklin Parkway  Philadelphia PA 19103.
Pioneering filmmaker Richard Leacock  former MIT professor  dies at age 89,Innovative documentary filmmaker Richard Leacock  who helped create the cinéma vérité style and was a driving force behind the film program at MIT  died on March 23 at his home in Paris. He was 89.Leacock was best known for expanding the possibilities of documentary film through the use of small  mobile  hand-held cameras  which provided documentaries with greater immediacy and opened up the range of subjects and scenes that could be filmed. He also helped devise some of the technical innovations necessary to provide high-quality sound for hand-held cameras.Leacock's first well-known film was 1954'sToby and the Tall Corn  about a traveling theater troupe in Missouri. He served as the cinematographer for Robert Drew's milestone documentary Primary  about John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign  and formed a working partnership with D. A. Pennebaker  for whom he served as cinematographer onMonterey Pop  from 1967  about the celebrated music festival.In 1968  Leacock joined MIT  at the invitation of then-provost Jerome Wiesner (later the Institute's president)  in the Documentary Film Section  a part of the School of Architecture and Planning  and later housed within the Media Lab. Leacock stayed until 1989  when he retired and moved to Paris."Ricky's humanity in his films and in his life taught all of us to be better people " said Glorianna Davenport  a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab  former head of the Media Lab's Media Fabrics research group  and a long-time colleague of Leacock.Bananas for filmLeacock was born in London on July 18  1921  and grew up on his father's banana plantation in the Canary Islands  before attending boarding schools in England. He made his first documentary at age 14 Canary Bananas  a 10-minute film about the plantation  using equipment his father had bought. Leacock went to college at Harvard and studied physics  with an eye toward understanding the technology of filmmaking  but dropped out to serve in World War II  as a combat photographer in Burma and China.After the war  Leacock had the opportunity to work on a 1948 film about the oil industry Louisiana Story  made by the well-known documentarist Robert Flaherty  which helped spur on his career. "I saw when we were using small cameras  we had tremendous flexibility  we could do anything we wanted and get a wonderful sense of cinema " Leacock later reflected about the experience.By the 1950s  Leacock had started collaborating with another innovator in documentaries  Robert Drew  with whom he developed a light camera with a tape recorder that would record sound simultaneously. Leacock and Drew called the style deriving from this method Living Camera  but it became better known as cinéma vérité or  sometimes  "direct cinema." Leacock  Drew and other collaborators applied the style to a wide variety of subjects; the results includedNehru(1962)  about the Indian prime minister;The Chair(1962)  on the struggle of a Chicago lawyer to save a client from the death penalty; andChiefs(1969)  about a police-chief convention in Hawaii.Building the film program at MITBy the late 1960s  Leacock was at MIT  where the program had been founded one year earlier by another filmmaker  Ed Pincus. The Documentary Film Section focused at first on students interested in making 16 mm films  then later expanded to 8 mm films and video projects. In 1974  MIT approved a Master of Science in Visual Studies degree and the program began taking graduate students. In 1985  the program became housed in the newly opened Media Lab.Hewing to Leacock's philosophy of filmmaking  MIT students typically worked on all aspects of a production — from directing to filming  recording sound  editing and more — rather than being limited to one part of a project.While the pace at which Leacock made documentaries slowed while he taught at MIT  he still pursued a wide range of projects  from filming student protesters on campus in the late 1960s to a "MovieMap" project in the 1970s with MIT's Architecture Machine Group  which allowed viewers to interactively "drive" through streets in Colorado. His footage of student protests became the 1969 filmNovember Actions. Leacock also pursued efforts to record musical performances at MIT  and created documentaries on diverse subjects from local painters to the legacy of physicist Niels Bohr."Ricky taught the world that being in front of the lens or being behind it was the same place " said Nicholas Negroponte  co-founder and chairman emeritus of the MIT Media Lab Leacock's memoir Richard Leacock: The Feeling of being There  will be released this summer  along with a compilation of his more than 40 documentaries and short films.
EAPS  physics professor James Elliot dies at 67,James Ludlow Elliot  a professor of planetary astronomy and physics at MIT who discovered the rings of Uranus in 1977  died on March 3 from cancer-related complications. He was 67.Elliot was known as one of the great observational planetary astronomers of the modern era. Among his accomplishments were leading the team that discovered the ring system of Uranus  and discovery of the atmosphere of Pluto. He was committed to excellence in teaching and mentoring  and was a staunch advocate for women in science.Elliot was born on June 17  1943  in Columbus  Ohio. He received an undergraduate degree in physics from MIT in 1965 and a PhD in astronomy from Harvard University in 1972. While a graduate student at Harvard  Elliot was an avid observer on the 60-inch telescope at the Agassiz Station in Harvard  Mass. He held a postdoctoral position at Cornell University  and joined the faculty of Cornell’s Astronomy Department in 1977. He returned to MIT in 1978  after he discovered Uranus's rings alongside Edward Dunham and Douglas Mink. He was also the director of MIT’s Wallace Astrophysical Observatory.Elliot was one of the pioneers in the technique of stellar occultations: watching a star as a planetary object moves in front of it  and studying the planetary object from the effect on the star’s light. Elliot used occultations to probe planetary atmospheres as well as the physical properties of small bodies in the outer solar system.But catching occultations can be challenging  since the events themselves might last only seconds and there are no second chances. To record them electronically  a team must be completely prepared.Elliot  however  excelled in coordination and preparation. When the planet Uranus was about to cross in front of a star in 1977  he and his team were flying in the Kuiper Airborne Observatory  telescopic equipment trained on the star  waiting. Because of the uncertainty in the event’s timing  they turned their equipment on about an hour in advance. To their surprise  the starlight disappeared briefly several times before the planet moved in; after the planet had moved on  the star winked out again several times. They realized that the symmetric dips in the star's brightness — before Uranus itself hid the star and after the star re-emerged — were caused by a ring system around the planet. Their discovery was confirmed by several more occultation events  and eventually with direct imaging from the Voyager 2 spacecraft  the Hubble Space Telescope and otherwise. Elliot received a NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement for this discovery.With the same occultation technique  Elliot and colleagues observed Pluto as it crossed in front of a star in 1988. The gradual manner in which the star disappeared allowed them to deduce that Pluto had an atmosphere  since in the absence of an atmosphere the star would have disappeared abruptly. Subsequent occultations have revealed that the atmosphere changes with time. The next such occultations will occur in June  and Elliot’s colleagues and students have observations planned.Elliot was especially supportive of women in astronomy. At a science celebration at MIT held in his honor in June 2010 (called the “Jimboree”)  nearly two dozen of his former and current students — more than half of them women — spoke about their research  as well as life lessons learned from Elliot. One common theme was his gift for engaging his students deeply in his research  and then sending them off on their own with his utter trust that they could do the research themselves. He also conveyed to all his students a strong work ethic  admonitions to always be prepared and reminders to always trust the data. At the Jimboree  notes of remembrance were captured on white index cards  because Elliot was never caught without one in his pocket.Jim Elliot is survived by his wife  Elaine; his daughters  Lyn and Martha; son-in-law  Lute Breuer; his granddaughter  Bella Breuer; a brother  Tom Elliot; and sisters  Suzanne Elliot and Martha Bureau.The family plans a private memorial service  and requests that no flowers be sent. Gifts may be made to the Wallace Observatory Fund via mail (Attn: Bonny Kellermann  MIT Office of Memorial Gifts  600 Memorial Drive  MIT Room W98-516  Cambridge  MA 02139-4822) oronline(be sure to indicate that this is a gift in memory of Jim Elliot).
Earl Miners Harvey  former MIT architect  dies at 93,Earl Miners Harvey  an architect who worked at MIT for more than 15 years  died on Tuesday  Feb. 15. He was 93.Harvey left the U.S. in 1936 and became a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1947  he returned and attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design  where he studied under Walter Gropius and graduated with a master’s in architecture in 1949.Harvey joined MIT in 1967  and retired in 1983 as a staff architect and principal structural engineer in the Department of Facilities.Donations in Harvey's memory can be made to Alzheimer’s Association  311 Arsenal St.  Watertown  MA 02472. Services and reception will be held at St. Peter’s Church on April 16  at 10:30 a.m.
Frank McClintock  professor emeritus  alumnus  dies at 90,Frank Ambrose McClintock ’43  SM ’43  professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering  died on Feb. 20  in the Briarwood Health Care facility in Needham  Mass. He was 90.McClintock was born in 1921 in St. Paul  Minn.  and earned his SB and SM degrees from MIT in 1943  and his PhD from the California Institute of Technology in 1950. He was named assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT in 1949; he was promoted to associate professor in 1955; and to full professor in 1959. He retired from the Institute in 1990  becoming a professor emeritus.McClintock was a pioneer in melding of applied mechanics and materials science  and taught the material to MIT undergraduates. In 1966  he co-authored a book — still in print — on the subject  titled Mechanical Behavior of Materials  with Ali Argon. The book paralleled with McClintock's laboratory practice for students  where they explored the aspects of mechanical behavior phenomena through self-chosen projects.His professional contributions revolutionized the understanding of the fracture process in engineering practice  by introducing a physical and mechanistic perspective emphasizing the plasticity aspects of ductile fracture and fatigue crack propagation.His trendsetting publications — which continued strong until recent years — were recognized by a series of prestigious awards  including the James Clayton Prize in 1956 of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers of Britain; the Nadai Award and the Drucker Medal of the ASME; the Howe Medal of the ASM; the Griffith Medal of the European Structural Integrity Society; as well as numerous special recognitions for best papers.

Anne Mayes  former materials science professor  dies at 46,Anne Mayes ’86  a materials science and engineering professor who established a fellowship for students after leaving the Institute for health reasons in 2006  died on Tuesday  Jan. 25. She was 46.Mayes  the first woman to rise from assistant professor to tenured professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DSME)  had battled breast cancer since 1994. When three surgeries and intense chemotherapy failed to cure the disease  she underwent a clinical trial in 1997 that eradicated the disease but left her immune system susceptible and with her lung capacity slowly degenerating.She ultimately left the Institute in 2006 because of her illness  but made sure to leave something behind.With almost $300 000 in available funds in her discretionary account  and with additional funds from the provost's office  the dean of the School of Engineering's office and community members' donations  Mayesformed a fellowship  which the department named in her honor and which Mayes called "a wonderful way to be remembered." The fellowship currently supports one student each year."I wished to leave the funds to the department to spend in any way they were most needed " Mayes told the MIT News Office in 2008  adding that she hoped the fellowship would aid in "attracting the very best students to our graduate program."Mayes was a polymer expert  and her research at MIT focused on lithium polymer batteries and the role of polymers in environmental issues. One of her major developments was “baroplastics ” a plastic that becomes soft under pressure  which allowed for recycling with less energy and without degradation.However  Mayes' focus was always on students  and in 2001 she was named aMacVicar faculty fellow— an honor given for outstanding  undergraduate teaching  mentoring and educational innovation."She was fiercely dedicated to MIT students  not only to her advisees and UROPs  but also to the students in her classroom and to all the Course III majors " said DMSE Head Edwin "Ned" Thomas. "This dedication led her to head up the drive to introduce biomaterials to the curriculum and to redesign the laboratory subjects to be the types of subjects that she would have wanted to take as a student."Plans are underway for a memorial service at MIT in the spring.

Richard L. Cartwright  emeritus professor of philosophy  dies at age 85,Richard Cartwright  a founding figure of philosophy at MIT and a member of the faculty for nearly 30 years  died on Dec. 19. He was 85.A formidable critic  of his own work as well as others'  he was known for a small number of classic papers in metaphysics and philosophy of language  but especially for his influence on colleagues and students. Skeptical of easy solutions  but at the same time deeply respectful of common sense  much of his endeavor was to see questions clearly enough to be able to begin answering them. Where the territory is ill-defined  he held  "difference of opinion is premature."Born in 1925  Cartwright took his BA from Oberlin College in 1945 and his PhD from Brown in 1954. He then taught at Michigan  where he met his future wife  Helen Morris  herself a philosopher  and then at Wayne State. In 1967 he moved to MIT  where he was appointed to strengthen the new graduate program  and where he continued to teach until his retirement in 1996.Cartwright's impact on philosophy at MIT  and on the graduate program in particular  was enormous. Impressed by the intensive training offered to scientists and engineers  with their frequent problem sets  Cartwright set out to offer something similar to the incoming philosophy graduate students. The result was the proseminar  a three-hour twice-weekly class in which the students discussed philosophical problem sets and gave presentations on key philosophical texts under the eye of Cartwright and his colleagues. The rigor and clarity that he required left its mark on many generations of MIT students and  indirectly  on many other graduate students at institutions where the proseminar has been emulated.Cartwright was also a forthright administrator  serving twice as head of philosophy  and also as head of the humanities department. Here again his intolerance of cant and intellectual laziness made him a force in the administration of the humanities in general and of philosophy in particular.The Department of Linguistics and Philosophy will organize an event in his memory at a later date.
Austin Petzke  former manager of Building Services at MIT  dies at age 67,Austin Petzke  who served for many years as the manager of Building Services in Physical Plant  died on Nov. 23 in Saugus  Mass. He was 67 years old.Petzke was born in East Boston and later moved to Saugus where he and his wife of 46 years  Geraldine (Venuti)  raised two sons. His son  David  works at MIT as a driver for Copy Technology Center.Petzke started out in Facilities  then Physical Plant  as a supervisor on the night shift and after seven years moved to evenings before ultimately working the day shift. As manager of Building Services  he was responsible for the mail and shipping areas as well as grounds and custodial services.He was also a training supervisor and created and taught a custodial training program. “I always told the custodians that they are a very important part of MIT ” he said. Before the building facility control systems were put in place the custodians served as a security force on campus. They would watch for floods or for trespassers on campus. “We’d put the night shift workers on the first floor so that they could see who was entering a building ” he recalled.“Austin was such a marvelous individual ” said former Chief Facilities Officer Vicky Sirianni. “He filled our days at MIT with laughter  but also with great wisdom  excellence and good will. He was a very special person to me and so many others.”Upon his retirement in 2004  Petzke said  “I consider MIT home and everyone here is my friend.” He came back to the Institute in 2007 and worked part time in the Property Office’s satellite area in WW15.He had a passion for hunting and enjoyed spending time in Maine where he had a second home.A memorial service was held at the Blessed Sacrament Church in Saugus.In addition to his wife  Petzke is survived by David Petzke of Melrose; Brian Petzke of Saugus; two grandchildren  Kasandra and Andrew Petzke; and a brother  Steven Petzke  of East Boston.
MIT Sloan Professor Emeritus Eli Shapiro dies at 94,Professor Emeritus Eli Shapiro  the bow-tie-bedecked economist who helped to develop the MIT Sloan School of Management’s academic character  died Saturday  Dec. 4  after a short illness. He was 94.Shapiro was professor of finance at MIT Sloan from 1952 until 1962  before leaving to teach at Harvard Business School. He returned to MIT Sloan in 1976 as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Management  a position he held until his retirement in 1984.MIT Sloan’s first associate dean  Shapiro was known for his finance-appropriate dictum “Don’t forget the cash!” In addition to his work at MIT and Harvard  he taught at the University of Chicago  chaired the finance committee of the board of directors of Travelers Insurance Companies  and was president of the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1982 until 1984.Shapiro arrived at MIT Sloan just as it was being established as a new school of management (it had previously been known as Course XV at MIT). He would become the school’s first associate dean  as well as chairman of the Sloan Fellows executive education program.“Professor Shapiro had an extraordinarily distinguished career ” said John C. Head III Dean David Schmittlein. “More than anyone  he was instrumental in charting the future academic direction of the school in the 1950s.”Trained in finance  Shapiro took to the culture and plurality of MIT  seeking out competitive advantage for the management school in the halls of the Institute.“When I came to the school  it was my view that management education was a synthetic product  the application of various disciplines to the management of an enterprise ” Shapiro said in a 2000 interview. “You build a faculty by taking people from various disciplines who have an interest in applying those disciplines to solve management problems. MIT was science and engineering  so that’s where we turned.”“In the 21st century  most of the big issues of industry are technological ” Shapiro said. “The more technical management becomes  the greater Sloan has an advantage by being part of MIT.”Shapiro was also known for his devotion to bow ties. Students in one of his last Program for Senior Executive sessions surprised the retiring professor by wearing bow ties in his honor and leaving the neckwear on his desk at the end of class.Shapiro is survived by his daughter  Laura Dowling  her husband  Neal Dowling  and granddaughters  Julia and Sarah Dowling  all of Sudbury  Mass. Burial will be private. A memorial service is planned for the spring. Donations to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute  44 Binney St.  Boston  MA  02115  are requested in lieu of flowers.

Aerospace engineer Joseph Gavin ‘41  SM ‘42 dies at 90,Joseph G. Gavin Jr.  former president of Grumman Corp. who led the company’s development of the Lunar Module for the Apollo program  died this week in Amherst  Mass. at the age of 90. Gavin was a life member of the MIT Corporation.Gavin  who earned SB and SM degrees in aeronautical engineering from MIT in 1941 and 1942  served in the U.S. Navy during World War II  where he worked on early jet-powered fighter aircraft. He then joined Grumman  where he worked for 39 years. For 10 years  he was Grumman’s Director of the Lunar Module Program for Apollo  and in 1972 became the company’s president. He retired from Grumman in 1985  and since then lived in Amherst  Mass.In an interview last year withTechnology Review  Gavin recalled his experiences with the Apollo program  saying “There’s a certain exuberance that comes from being out on the edge of technology  where things are not certain  where there is some risk  and where you make something work.”That risk became very real in April 1970 when the Apollo 13 mission was rocked by an explosion that severely damaged the spacecraft. NASA and Grumman engineers scrambled to improvise an emergency procedure to save the crew by using the Lunar Module  which Grumman had developed  as a kind of lifeboat. “That was the tensest episode in my career ” Gavin said. “The team at Grumman developed a personal relationship with every one of the astronauts in the Apollo era. We were building machines that our friends would operate — not some faceless individuals unknown to us.”Richard Battin  a senior lecturer in MIT’s Aeronautics and Astronautics department who worked extensively with Gavin on the Apollo lander project  whose guidance and navigation system Battin directed in what was then the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory  says that Gavin remained passionately interested in education and appeared regularly in a freshman seminar that Battin taught. “He was really good with the freshmen ” Battin says. “I didn’t even have to ask” him to participate in the seminar  he says. “He would call me up” to ask to take part.Carl Mueller  a fellow member of MIT’s class of ’41  in remarks delivered in 1995 when Gavin was made a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation  said that “his generosity and abiding concern have strengthened this institution immeasurably ” and called him “a modest  gentle man whose powerful intellect and effective leadership have literally put men on the moon and returned them safely to Earth.”Gavin received the NASA Distinguished Public Medal In 1971 and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1974. He was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.“There are probably people who would say I was a workaholic ” he said in the Technology Review interview. “But when I was at Grumman I was doing something I would have preferred to do over anything else. When you’re in that situation  the hours don’t mean much. You do whatever is necessary.”He is survived by his wife of 67 years  Dorothy  his sons  Joseph III and Donald  and four grandchildren. A daughter  Tay Anne Gavin Erickscon  died in 1998.
Harry P. Portnoy  former campus architect  dies at age 88,Harry P. Portnoy  who served for many years as campus architect in MIT’s Department of Facilities  died on Sept. 25 in Canton  Mass. He was 88.Portnoy was born in 1922 in New York to immigrant parents. He joined the Army and served for four years  during which time he was deployed in North Africa. He attended Wentworth Institute  where he studied architectural construction. In 1948  he traveled to Israel  where  with colleagues in the Zionist movement and joined by his wife and young daughter  he took part in the founding of a kibbutz in the Galilee.He returned to the United States several years later and realized his dream of becoming an architect. After receiving his degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953  he worked in several architectural offices  including that of Hugh Stubbins  Samuel Glazer  Herman Herrey and F.A. Stahl. His projects included the Berlin Congress Hall in Berlin  the master plan for the Hellenic University and several large housing projects.Portnoy joined the planning office at MIT in 1967 and eventually became campus architect. In this role  he was responsible for design  building programming  design review and construction administration for new buildings and renovation work. During this period  approximately 25 new buildings were built  and 25 major renovations occurred as part of an expansion of the Institute’s research  teaching  athletic and residential facilties. Prominent among these projects was the Media Lab building  an especially innovative project in which Portnoy worked with I.M. Pei ’40 and partners  and with three artists who became integral to the design.After retiring from MIT in 1985  Portnoy consulted with various architectural firms  served as guest lecturer in the Department of Architecture  and continued work with the Boston Architectural Center.He had a passion for the Renaissance and pursued graduate work in art at Boston University and also stayed for extended periods of time in Florence  Italy. He spent much time in his retirement at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston  and contributions to that institution can be made in his memory.A memorial service was held at the Newton Cemetery  where family  friends and colleagues spoke about their memories of this vibrant and creative man.Portnoy is survived by his wife  Frances  four children  five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Scientist-astronaut and former MIT professor William B. Lenoir dies at 71,William B. Lenoir ’61  SM ’62  PhD ’65  a former MIT professor and scientist-astronaut who flew as a mission specialist on the fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle  died on Aug. 26 in Florida as a result of head injuries sustained during a bicycle accident. He was 71.“He was a model for what the science astronaut should be ” said Laurence Young  the Apollo Professor of Astronautics at MIT and a former member of the astronaut corps  who knew Lenoir from his days at NASA.MIT has always been a major source of astronauts  but Young noted that Lenoir was “the only one to have gone from active faculty status to become a flown astronaut — and he brought with him the mature analytical judgment of an MIT ‘lifer.’” (Two other MIT faculty have served in the astronaut office: Young was a payload specialist but served only as flight alternate  and Professor of the Practice Jeffrey Hoffman  who made five space shuttle flights  joined MIT’s academic instructional staff after he left NASA.)From 1964 to 1965  Lenoir was an instructor at MIT  and in 1965  he was named assistant professor of electrical engineering. His work at MIT included teaching electromagnetic theory and systems theory as well as performing research in remote sensing. He was an investigator in several satellite experiments and continued research in this area while fulfilling his astronaut assignments. He was a Sloan Scholar and winner of the Carleton E. Tucker Award for Teaching Excellence at MIT.Lenoir was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967. He was backup science pilot for Skylab 3 and Skylab 4  the second and third manned missions in the Skylab Program. During Skylab 4  he was co-leader of the visual observations project and coordinator between the flight crew and the principal investigators for the solar science experiments.From September 1974 to July 1976  Lenoir worked as leader of the NASA Satellite Power Team. This team was formed to investigate the potential of large-scale satellite power systems for terrestrial utility consumption. Lenoir supported the space shuttle program in the areas of orbit operations  training  extravehicular activity  and payload deployment and retrieval.In 1982  Lenoir logged more than 122 hours in space as a mission specialist on the shuttle mission STS-5  the first flight to deploy commercial satellites. Following STS-5  Lenoir was responsible for the direction and management of mission development within the Astronaut Office.Lenoir left NASA in September 1984  to assume a position with management and technology consulting firm Booz  Allen & Hamilton Inc. He returned to NASA in June 1989 as the associate administrator for space flight  responsible for the development  operating and implementation of the necessary policy for the space shuttle and all U.S. government civil launch activities. He left NASA again in April 1992 for Booz Allen.“When he returned to NASA as associate administrator for space flight  during the critical formative years of the International Space Station  he continued to show his technical acumen and good-natured leadership ” Young said of Lenoir. “During that period  when he was overseeing all of the human flight programs  he once remarked to me ‘When you find out who is in charge of the Space Station  be sure to let me know.’”As an alumnus  Lenoir remained active with MIT through various volunteer efforts. Beginning right after his graduation  Lenoir took an annual fund role in the second century fund campaign; recently he was vice president of the Alumni Association's Board of Directors and a member of the Committee on Nominations for Corporation Visiting Committees. He also served as a leader in the Class of 1961  and was working on his 50th reunion and reunion gift at the time of his passing. He was a leader with the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) alumni group  hosting reunions of his fraternity brothers and working on SAE’s recolonization.

Roger W. Sudbury  former executive officer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory  dies at age 72,Longtime MIT Lincoln Laboratory employee Roger W. Sudbury SM '63  EE '64  who rose from a technical staff member researching solid-state devices for modern radars to become the Laboratory’s executive officer  serving within the Director’s Office  passed away on Aug. 22. He was 72 years old.Sudbury was nationally recognized as a visionary leader in the development of gallium-arsenide monolithic circuits for applications in electronically scanned radars. The work that he led at the Laboratory encouraged and influenced efforts at a number of major electronic firms  leading to the United States’ world leadership in military solid-state radars for missile and air defense. These advances are evident in the radars for the new fighters  the F-22 and F-35  as well as in a number of missile-defense radars.He served a tour from 1976 to 1978 at the Lincoln Laboratory Kwajalein Field Site in the Marshall Islands  where he was appointed the associate site manager. He also led the fielding and operation of the Cobra Eye System  an airborne infrared data collection platform. Through his 41-year career at Lincoln Laboratory  he served as a knowledgeable adviser  a wise mentor  and a friendly confidant to many staff and managers.He was active in a leadership role in the IEEE  the world's leading professional society for electrical and electronic engineers. He served on the IEEE board and chaired its Employee Benefits and Compensation Committee. He was President of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society in 2000  and in 2010 was the recipient of the Society’s Distinguished Service Award “for outstanding and dedicated service to the society.” He received the IEEE’s prestigious award with his election to Fellow of the IEEE in 2004 for his contributions to “leadership in gallium-arsenide integrated circuits.”Early in his career  he served in the U.S. Army  attaining the rank of captain  and was responsible for the Lightweight Observation Helicopter avionics package  which became the Army’s standard avionics.He was valedictorian of his high school class in 1956 and was one of the initial National Merit Scholars. In 1960  he graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in electrical engineering with highest honors and did his graduate work at MIT.Sudbury was the second of three sons born to Judge J. Graham and Avis Sudbury of Blytheville  Ark. He married the former Margaret Hobbs in 1965  and they have two sons  Jonathan and Andrew.A 40-year resident of Winchester  Mass.

James Keck  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering  dies at 86,James C. Keck  a professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering who began working at MIT in the mid-1960s  died on Aug. 9. He was 86.Keck joined MIT in 1965 as the Ford Professor of Engineering and developed teaching and research programs in thermodynamics  kinetics and mechanics related to energy generation and air pollution. Keck was the author of dozens of papers  and his research at MIT focused on atomic and molecular kinetics  thermodynamics and high-temperature gas dynamics. He was recognized by the National Academy of Engineering for “developing innovative  widely used concepts for modeling coupled chemical and physical phenomena in engine combustion and high-temperature flow.”“Few of Professor Keck’s students and colleagues will ever forget seeing him walking around MIT with a sharp pencil and a pad of paper filled with equations and diagrams  ready to engage us in deep technical conversations filled with sharp intuition and insight few others possess ” said Ahmed Ghoniem  Ronald C. Crane professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and a colleague of Keck’s for 27 years. “His child-like enthusiasm for science and engineering was contagious and led to significant and long-lasting contributions in engine development and energy sciences. Jim always maintained that complex systems are governed by few parameters and that their behavior can be quantified accurately using ‘simplified’ models built around the Second Law of Thermodynamics. He always asked  ‘What is your model?’ insisting that conceptualization is the essence of engineering science.”Keck was born in New York City in 1924. In 1944  when he was studying physics at Cornell University  he was put into the U.S. Army Special Engineering Detachment and sent to Los Alamos to work on the atomic bomb. There he met Margaret Ramsey  who was also working at Los Alamos as a physicist: the two would marry in 1947.After the war  Keck returned to Cornell  where he received a BA in 1947 and a PhD in 1951. His early interests included high-energy particle physics: Keck carried out pioneering research in photo-nuclear reactions and in spectral radiation from high-temperature shock-heated air.In 1952  after serving as a research associate at Cornell  Keck left for the California Institute of Technology  where he served as a research fellow until 1955. That year  he joined the Avco Everett Research Laboratory  where he researched the reentry of missiles and spacecraft into the atmosphere. At the time of his departure from AERL in 1965  he served as its deputy director.After joining the MIT faculty in 1965  he began researching the problem of burning rates and pollutant formation in internal combustion engines. His experiments and theoretical studies showed many things about such engines: how nitric oxide is formed in them  the nature of turbulent flame propagation  and the nature of “knock.” His work is widely used in the automotive industry in the design of efficient and clean engines.After retiring from MIT  Keck advised graduate students at Northeastern University.Until his death  Keck worked to develop basic theoretical models to describe elementary atomic and molecular excitation  thermally induced chemical-reaction rates  rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium  flame theory and engine combustion.Ronald Probstein  Ford Professor of Engineering  Emeritus  was responsible for getting Keck to come to MIT. Probstein met Keck in 1955 at AERL  where Probstein was a consultant. The two remained close friends until Keck’s death. “Jim was a remarkable person  having continued to produce outstanding research right up to his last days ” Probstein said. “Despite his outpouring of work throughout his life  which made him an outstanding scientist esteemed throughout the scientific world  I always remember a remark he once made to me  that ‘I'd rather be loved than famous.’”Keck was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Physical Society.He is survived by his wife  Margaret Ramsey Keck; his son  Robert Keck of Rochester  N.Y.; his daughter  Patricia Keck of Andover  Mass.; and his brother  Charles Keck of Andover  Vt.Memorial contributions may be made to Massachusetts General Hospital Leukemia and Lymphoma Fund  165 Cambridge St.  Suite 600  Boston  MA 02114  or to the charity of one's choice.
George J. Devlin Jr.  an MIT power plant maintenance mechanic  dies at 50,George J. Devlin Jr.  a power plant maintenance mechanic in MIT’s Department of Facilities  died suddenly on Monday  Aug. 9. He was 50.In his five years of service to MIT  Devlin performed maintenance at the William R. Dickson Cogeneration Plant on Vassar Street. Among his duties were the repair and inspection of boilers  the alignment of motors  and the cleaning of chillers.“In the time I was his supervisor ” said Larry Kelley  maintenance manager at MIT’s Central Utility Plant  “I never heard George say a bad word about anyone. I also never heard anyone utter a bad word about George. MIT is all the better for having had George in its employ  even if only for five years. He had a great sense of humor and was a good worker. George  we will miss you. God bless.”Devlin was born in Jamaica Plain  Mass. He graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in the North End of Boston and attended Northeastern University for two years. Prior to coming to work for MIT  he worked for Boston Edison for 22 years as a power plant mechanic. When the South Boston plant he worked for closed  he and four coworkers all came to work together at MIT. Devlin was a member of the Service Employees International Union  Local 615.Devlin  who lived in South Boston  had a passion for golf. Family members describe him as a very easy-going person well-liked by those who knew and met him.

Charles Freed  pioneer of laser technologies  dies at age 84,Charles Freed SM ’54  EE ’58  who survived a Russian prison camp during World War II  escaped from behind the Iron Curtain and became a pioneer in laser technologies during a 32-year career at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory  died Aug. 4 of a brain tumor. He was 84.“Charles Freed was extraordinary  escaping from severe persecution in Russia and contributing very importantly to laser science ” said Nobel laureate Charles Townes  with whom Freed collaborated for decades. “His carbon-dioxide lasers have been critical for my measurements of the sizes  changes  and dynamics of stars  as well as for many other important applications.”Born Karoly Fried in 1926 in Budapest  Hungary  Freed showed early signs of the vibrant curiosity that would later come to define his career: As a child  he took apart the family phonograph several times to find the “little people” inside.During World War II  he was sent to the ghetto with the other Jews of Miskolc  then taken into the Hungarian army as a laborer  and then captured and held as a prisoner of war and laborer in Russia for 3-1/2 years. He returned to Hungary only to learn that nearly all of his family had perished. He was accepted as a student at New York University  but the Hungarians denied him an exit visa. Eventually he escaped in 1949  and wrote in a letter: “I appreciate freedom above all. Without that the whole life is only an imprisonment and fear”.He immigrated to New York  and received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from NYU in 1952. He enrolled as a graduate student at MIT that same year. As an MIT graduate student  he lived at Ashdown House and worked in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) on high-energy electron beam sources and vacuum systems compatible with electron beams. He considered himself very fortunate to have been a member of Professor Louis Smullin’s laboratory: “The graduate students and visiting scientists came from all over the world but fast became a remarkably close-knit family where differences in nationality  race  and religion actually enriched our daily lives ” he recalled years later.In 1954  he met and fell in love with Florence Wallach  then a Harvard graduate student; they married in 1956. From 1958 to 1962  he worked at Raytheon Company as a senior engineer in the research division and as a group leader for special microwave device operations. In 1959  he become a U.S. citizen and changed his name from Fried to Freed.In February 1962  he joined the staff of MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory and began a career in laser research after completing a summer course on the newly invented laser (then called an optical maser). In 1966  he developed the first stable carbon dioxide laser  and shortly thereafter developed a second generation “ultra-stable” carbon dioxide laser  with 1 000-fold improvement in frequency stability. Subsequently  he developed a third-generation laser that was highly modular and therefore simpler to construct  easier to operate and less expensive. In 1978  he was promoted to the rank of senior staff at Lincoln Laboratory; he retired in 1994 but continued to do consulting work. For example  in 2009-10 he worked on applying carbon dioxide lasers to the problem of global warming.Freed’s lasers are still in use today for diverse applications  ranging from wind-shear detection at airports to high-resolution imaging laser radars for missile defense to basic research problems  such as determining secondary frequency standards and studies of the universe. Two lasers he designed and built are part of the MIT Museum’s Science and Technology collection.In all  Freed published 61 original research articles  technical reports and book chapters on a variety of topics  and presented his work at scientific conferences around the world. He received numerous awards and honors  including being named a Life Fellow of the IEEE in 1979 for “Contributions to gas lasers and the pioneering development of ultra-stable lasers”. In 1999  he was named a Fellow of the National Military Sensors Symposia for his contributions to missile guidance radar  laser radar and imaging of space objects. When asked recently to describe his professional strengths  he replied: “A knack for engineering that is very practical  and always having on-hand plenty of parts”.Family members describe Freed  who lived in Lincoln  Mass.  as a loving and unfailingly devoted husband  father and grandfather. He also loved music  skating  and swimming. He is survived by his wife  Florence  daughters Josie and Lisa E. Freed '82  SM '82  PhD '88  son-in-law Theodore D. Sussman PhD '87  and granddaughters Sara and Rachel Freed Sussman  whom he treasured and helped to take care of since they were born.Burial will be private.

Bill Mitchell  former dean of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning  dies at age 65,William J. Mitchell  the former dean of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning  who pioneered urban designs for networked  "smart" cities and helped oversee an ambitious building program that transformed MIT's physical campus  died on June 11 after a long battle with cancer. He was 65.Mitchell was considered one of the world's leading urban theorists. Through the work of his Smart Cities research group at the MIT Media Lab  he pioneered new approaches to integrating design and technology to make cities more responsive to their citizens and more efficient in their use of resources. He likened tomorrow's cities to living organisms or very-large-scale robots  with nervous systems that enable them to sense changes in the needs of their inhabitants and external conditions  and respond to these needs. A major portion of this new urban infrastructure focused on revamping urban transportation as we know it  and included the development of theCityCar  a light-weight  electric  shared vehicle that folds and stacks like supermarket shopping carts at convenient locations and has all essential mechanical systems housed in the car's wheels. Other Smart City innovations include the folding electric RoboScooter  and GreenWheel  which turns an ordinary bicycle into an electric-assisted one.Mitchell  who was the Alexander W. Dreyfoos  Jr. (1954) Professor of Architecture and Professor of Media Arts and Science  joined MIT in 1992 and over the next 18 years contributed handsomely to the Institute's intellectual life and campus spirit. As dean of architecture and planning  he championed the importance of the visual arts to MIT and concentrated on infusing new energy and visibility into the school by recruiting a number of innovative young faculty members. As a professor in the MIT Media Lab  Mitchell explored the new forms and functions of cities in the digital era  and suggested design and planning directions for the future. He was particularly interested in the relationship between real space  virtual space and human communities.But it was as architectural advisor to then-President Charles M. Vest that Mitchell left what was arguably his most visible and lasting mark on the Institute's campus. In that role  Mitchell guided one of the most ambitious building programs in U.S. higher education  a metamorphosis that added nearly one million square feet to MIT's 154-acre campus."One of my greatest pleasures at MIT was to work with Bill in his role as architectural advisor to the president. His guidance was essential in the transformation of our physical campus " said Vest. "He was a wonderful friend and colleague who brightened MIT and respected and advanced the human experience of our faculty  students and staff."Central to the $1 billion building program were five innovative architectural projects by world-renowned designers: Frank Gehry's Stata Center  Kevin Roche's Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center  Steven Holl's Simmons Hall  Charles Correa's Brain and Cognitive Sciences Complex and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Complex  which formally opened this spring. Mitchell attached a deep significance to the new buildings  which he said gave meaning to MIT's existence and represented its hopes and values. "Leading intellectual institutions  such as MIT  carry a particular responsibility to conceive of architectural projects not just as the rational allocation of resources to achieve quantifiable management goals  but also as inventive  critical contributions to our evolving culture " he said at the dedication of the Stata Center in 2004. "Anything less is as scandalous a betrayal of their advertised principles as pedestrian scholarship or mediocre science."Mitchell clearly relished the transformation of MIT's physical campus and his role in it  and it was not uncommon to see him leading community members and campus visitors on tours of the various construction sites. While each building was clearly unique  Mitchell wanted them all to be seen as part of a coherent landscape fabric; accordingly  he pushed for new "connective tissue" around campus — pedestrian routes  landscaping and commons facilities  for instance — to ensure that the whole be greater than the sum of its parts. "The fundamental idea is to weave everything together in a vibrant  residential community " Mitchell said in a 2001 campus talk.Mitchell offered an insider's look at the conceptualization  design and construction of the five buildings in his 2007 book Imagining MIT (MIT Press)  which he drafted in one long weekend at a Dublin hotel. "The behind-the-scenes story about how architecture gets done — a rarely told story  a hard-to-tell story — needed to be written " Mitchell said at the time.'A pioneer of the future'Born in 1944 and raised in rural Australia  Mitchell received a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Melbourne  a Master of Environmental Design from Yale and a Master of Arts from Cambridge. He was a Fellow of both the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and a recipient of six honorary doctorates. In 1997 he was awarded the annual Appreciation Prize of the Architectural Institute of Japan; he also chaired the National Academies Committee on Information Technology and Creativity.Before coming to MIT  Mitchell was the G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture and director of the Master in Design Studies Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He also served as head of the Architecture/Urban Design Program at UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning and taught at Yale  Carnegie-Mellon and Cambridge Universities.Mitchell was a prolific author. In his most recent book Reinventing the Automobile  co-authored with Christopher Borroni-Bird and Lawrence Burns (MIT Press  2010)  Mitchell reimagines the automobile for the 21st century  proposing that today's cars follow the same basic design principles as the Model T: they are well suited for conveying multiple passengers over long distances at high speeds  but inefficient for providing personal mobility within cities  where most of the world's people now live.Other publications includeWorld's Greatest Architect: Making  Meaning and Network Culture(2008);Placing Words: Symbols  Space  and the City(2005) Me++: The Cyborg Self and the Networked City(2003);e-topia: Urban Life  Jim-But Not As We Know It(1999);High Technology and Low-Income Communities  with Donald A. Schön and Bish Sanyal (1999);City of Bits: Space  Place  and the Infobahn(1995);The Reconfigured Eye: Visual Truth in the Post-Photographic Era(1992);The Logic of Architecture: Design  Computation  and Cognition(1990); andComputer-Aided Architectural Design(1977). He also served as chair of the Editorial Board at the MIT Press since 1994 and had been a member of the publisher's Management Board since 2000."Bill Mitchell was a very important thinker  truly a pioneer of the future " said Adèle Naudé Santos  current dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. "He was one of the first to understand the profound effects of computation on the architecture profession and of the Internet on everyday life. He also played an important role in research at the Media Lab and because he was such a prolific writer  his significant ideas will be with us for all time. His passing is an enormous loss. His contributions were unique.""Bill's highly unorthodox approach to re-thinking and re-framing daunting societal problems was the essence of his brilliance " said Frank Moss  director of the Media Lab. "It has significantly impacted my thinking about how one changes the world for the better."Mitchell is survived by his wife  Jane Wolfson; a daughter  Emily and son-in-law  Seth Rooder of Brooklyn Heights  NY; a son  Billy of Cambridge; his mother  Joyce of Berwick  Australia; a sister  Mary Close and brother-in-law John Close of Kallista  Australia; his previous wife  Elizabeth Asmis of Chicago; and a loving extended family.Donations in his memory may be made to the Learning Prep School at 1507 Washington St.  West Newton  MA 02465  where a technology fund will be established in his memory.A memorial service will be held at MIT at the new Media Lab Complex  75 Amherst Street  Cambridge  MA  on Wednesday  June 16 at 10 a.m. Private burial services will follow at Mt. Auburn Cemetery.Additional reporting by Scott Campbell and Ellen Hoffman

Art Smith  former dean and EECS professor  dies,Former Dean for Undergraduate Education and Student Affairs Arthur C. Smith  an electrical engineering professor who made meaningful contributions to student life and learning during nearly a half-century of dedicated service to MIT  died on Friday  April 23. He was 80.“He was very much someone who was in [the] students’ corner ” said Robert Randolph  who was senior associate dean for students before becoming MIT’s first Institute chaplain in 2007. “Art was a fierce protector of students and wanted them to be treated as adults.”The second of Smith’s three daughters  Amy '84  SM '95  ENG '95  a MacArthur fellow who created and teaches MIT’s influential D-Lab class  agreed. “The trust that Dad had in students is something that I see in my work  in that MIT trusts that students can do good things before they graduate ” Amy said. “That’s one of the things that he really personified.”Smith received a BS in physics from the University of Kansas in 1951  an MA in physics from Harvard University in 1954 and a PhD in applied physics from Harvard in 1958. He came to MIT as an assistant professor of electrical engineering in 1959  became associate professor in 1963 and was promoted to professor in 1968. His work included studies in thermoelectric energy conversion and semiconductor research. He co-authored two textbooks on electronic conduction in solids.He served as chairman of the Committee on Academic Performance (1972-74)  the Committee on Privacy (1975-77)  the Committee on Student Affairs (1979-81) and the Committee on Educational Policy (1983-85). He also was a member of the Minority Student Issues group.Smith agreed to serve as acting dean for student affairs in July 1990  succeeding Shirley McBay. The next year  he was appointed to a two-year term as dean for student affairs. A subsequent administrative reorganization added undergraduate education responsibilities after the death of Margaret MacVicar  who served as MIT's first dean of undergraduate education.Before becoming acting dean  Smith had involved himself deeply in student matters  chairing several committees dealing with student affairs and academic policy. When he appointed Smith acting dean  former Provost John M. Deutch  now an Institute Professor  referred to "his deep understanding of the institution and of the concerns of the students  developed over more than 30 years as a teacher  faculty leader  advisor and father of two graduates."According to Amy  Smith was just as deeply engaged with his community in Lexington  Mass. “He was a town-meeting member for years and most recently was on the board of appeals ” Amy says. Smith was also  she said  a “stalwart member of the trumpet section” of the Lexington band  where for some time Amy had joined him  as a saxophone player. Smith previously served as the band’s president and was still its librarian at the time of his death. “One of the things we had to do yesterday was make sure that the program got Xeroxed  because they have a concert coming up this weekend ” Amy said.At Lexington’s Follen Church  Amy said  Smith “ran the Christmas tree sales there; he was an avid supporter of the youth group; he cooked soup and baked bread; he was in the church government — a lot of things.”Baked goods played a prominent role in yet another of Smith’s roles: sports dad. When  as an undergrad  Amy played on the MIT volleyball game  her father would attend all her games  dragging along the man with whom he had shared an office when he first arrived at MIT: President Paul Gray. “There were hardly any fans there at all ” Amy says. “It was Dad  Paul Gray  Constantine [Simonides  an MIT vice president]  and maybe two other roommates  or something.” Smith got in the habit of bringing chocolate-chip cookies and granola to the games. If one of Amy’s teammates complained that there weren’t enough cookies to go around  she would get her own personal batch of cookies the next week. “By the end  my father would come with two shopping bags full of ziplocked bags of cookies specifically labeled for different people on the team ” Amy says  “if they wanted different things in them.”Gray recalled that Smith was a formidable opponent on the squash court. "Art and I took squash lessons together at MIT in 1961  and we played squash together for the next 49 years ” Gray said. “Each of our matches was tough  and the day's winner was always difficult to predict in advance."Smith was chairman of the faculty from 1983 to 1985 and received the Gordon Y Billard Award for distinguished service to the Institute in 1987. In 1996  when he stepped down as dean  the Institute honored him with the creation of the Arthur C. Smith Award  which recognizes a member of the MIT community “for meaningful contributions and devotion to undergraduate student life at MIT.”Smith is survived by his wife  Wilma Ronco; his daughters  Abby SM ’84  Amy and Tracy; and two stepsons  Will and Dan Ronco.Every year  Smith used to walk inProject Bread’s Walk for Hunger. In this year’s walk  which takes place on May 2  Smith’s family will be walking in his name. Anyone who wishes to sponsor them should contact Amy atabs@mit.edu. Amy is also fielding inquiries about a fund that the family is establishing in Art’s name at MIT. Donations in Art’s name may also be made toFollen Churchin Lexington.The family will be holding an open house from 6 to 8 p.m. on Monday  April 26  at their home in Lexington (131 Worthen Road). Friends and colleagues from MIT are invited to attend. A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday  April 28  at the Follen Church Sanctuary at 755 Massachusetts Ave. in East Lexington. There will be a reception following the service in the Community Center.
Scientist  engineer and presidential adviser H. Guyford Stever dies at 93,H. Guyford Stever  who served as the chief science adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford  died on April 9 at his home in Gaithersburg  Md. He was 93. During his long and illustrious career  Stever also headed two MIT departments and was professor in another  was president of Carnegie-Mellon University  headed the National Science Foundation  and led the committee that brought about the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958 and the committee that redesigned the space shuttle’s boosters after the Challenger accident in 1986.Stever was born on Oct. 24  1916  in Corning  N.Y. He graduated from Colgate in 1938 and received his doctorate in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1941  and then  within weeks  went to work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. He joined the MIT faculty in 1946  eventually directing the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering while holding a professorship in aeronautical engineering. He left MIT in 1965 when he became president of Carnegie-Mellon.Stever's presidency of Carnegie Mellon University was marked by significant change and growth in the institution  including the merger of Carnegie Institute of Technology and Mellon Institute to form CMU  the establishment of a College of Humanities and Social Studies  the addition of the School of Urban and Public Affairs  the formation of a Department of Computer Science and a Statistics Department  and a Transportation Research Center. His work at CMU  combined with his earlier work at MIT  prepared him for the Directorship of the National Science Foundation.As director of the NSF  he strengthened NSF's highest priority mission as supporter of basic research  primarily conducted in universities by peer-reviewed principal investigators. This was  and still is  NSF's most important contribution to the nation's strength and well-being. A secondary NSF role emerged  resulting from the OPEC oil embargo of 1973. He rapidly increased NSF's non-fossil and renewable energy sources research  later transferred to ERDA and DOE.Following his work in the Nixon and Ford administrations  Stever served as an independent corporate board member  a non-profit organization trustee and a science and technology consultant. He contributed to management  research  manufacturing technology  and product development at a dozen corporations  including TRW  Goodyear and Schering Plough. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering and the Carnegie Commission on Science  Technology and Government.Ronald Probstein  the Ford Professor Emeritus of Engineering at MIT  knew Stever for 60 years. He says Stever “was a superlative administrator who was always quick to understand a problem at hand  and just as quick to bring in the right people to solve it. I saw him on many occasions in the midst of exceedingly contentious situations  but he never ruffled.” In hiring and working with people  Probstein says  Stever “asked for the best  and was convincing enough to get just that.”Stever is survived by his sister  Margarette Johnson; sons Guy Jr. and Roy; daughters Sarah Stever and Margarette Weed; and seven grandchildren. His wife of 58 years  the former Louise Risley  died in 2004.
Agnes N. Morrice  44-year MIT employee  dies at age 95,Agnes N. “Nancy” Morrice  who worked at MIT for more than four decades in various telecommunications roles  died on April 2. She was 95.Morrice began working at MIT in 1936 as an elevator operator in Building 10. It was there that she came to the attention of Carleton Tucker  an electrical engineering professor who was in charge of MIT’s telecommunications operations at the time. He encouraged Morrice to become a telephone operator — a job she had previously held when she lived on Martha’s Vineyard.In those days  telephone calls were routed through long banks of plug-in switchboards  and operators connected the calls manually. Morrice was promoted from operator to shift supervisor to chief operator  and eventually she became the assistant to the director of telecommunications.In that role  Morrice oversaw the operators  customer service representatives and billing. She directed various technology changes  such as MIT’s transition in 1972 to New England Telephone’s Centrex system  which allowed for direct calls.Morrice retired in 1980 after 44 years at MIT. Morton Berlan  her manager at the time  remembered Morrice “as a wonderful person who was a great help to me and to all at MIT.” Diane Catalano  who reported to Morrice and still works part-time as an operator at MIT  called Morrice “very diligent  and a good person to work for.”Morrice leaves her sister  Margaret Reuters of Yarmouthport; many nephews and nieces; and her close friends  the Irving family of Marlborough  Mass.  with whom she made her home.A memorial service will be held for Morrice at 2 p.m. on Sept. 27 at theFirst Congregational Churchin Natick  Mass.

Michael S. Feld  physics professor  dies at age 69,MIT Professor of Physics Michael S. Feld  who made fundamental contributions in the field of laser science and later applied physics to solving biomedical problems  died on Saturday  April 10  after an eight-year struggle with multiple myeloma. Feld  who directed the MIT George R. Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory since 1976  was 69.Feld first came to MIT in 1958 as an undergraduate. He went on to do his PhD at MIT under the supervision of Professor Ali Javan  and in 1968 he became a member of the MIT faculty. During his 52 years at MIT he was an active contributor to the Institute community; he was particularly proud of his work helping to develop a welcoming ambience for minority students  staff and faculty.“He had an amazing track record of mentoring African-American scientists  including astronaut Ronald McNair  who received his PhD under Michael’s supervision. In turn  Ron became Michael’s karate master. Michael delighted in illustrating the physics of karate with classroom demonstrations like breaking a wooden board with a swift blow. And when Michael stopped advancing at the brown belt  he encouraged his sons to persist to obtain black belts  showing that the true master is the one who helps others to achieve their best ” said Edmund Bertschinger  head of MIT’s Department of Physics.Feld's research interests ranged from fundamental physics — superradiance and innovations in laser spectroscopy — to biomedicine and biomedical engineering  new kinds of microscopy  spectroscopic identification of cancer cells  and novel uses of the electric field to study cell behavior. In 1973  Feld made the first experimental observation of superradiance  the collective spontaneous emission of an assembly of excited atoms. In 1987  he began a series of experiments to study the radiation of a single  isolated atom in an optical resonator  which led to the first demonstration of enhanced and suppressed spontaneous emission and radiative level shifts in an open optical resonator and  in 1994  to the development of the single atom laser.Feld's more recent research activities dealt with laser biomedicine. He directed the Laser Biomedical Research Center at MIT  where he worked on the use of fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy to diagnose biological tissues and image disease via endoscopy and optical tomography.Feld was a hard worker who inspired his students to follow his example  said Ramachandra Dasari  associate director of the Spectroscopy Lab  who has been a friend and colleague of Feld’s since 1980. At the time  Feld was trying to persuade Dasari to leave a job in India to come to MIT  which he was reluctant to do. “I told him to give me a 10-month appointment and then I would go back ” Dasari said. But Feld’s friendship and willingness to let Dasari work on whatever he liked convinced him to stay. “Both professionally and personally my life has been intertwined with Michael’s for so many years we have become members of each other’s families ” said Dasari.Feld supervised more than 50 PhD students during his career  and even in the past few months  as he was in and out of the hospital  he continued coming into the lab and working with his graduate students.He also enjoyed singing and started a group called the Spectratones  which performed at Spectroscopy Lab events. Many of the group’s songs were based on poems that Feld composed about his students and colleagues  said Dasari. Last summer  the Spectratones performed at “Feld Fest ” a symposium held to honor Feld’s 50 years at MIT and 33 years as director of the Spectroscopy Lab.Feld received the Thompson Award in 1991 for the development of biomedical Raman spectroscopy  and the Vinci of Excellence (France) in 1995 for development of the single atom laser. In 1992  he was the Wolk Visitor and Lecturer at Colgate University. He was 1996 Distinguished Baetjer Colloquium speaker at Princeton University. He was a research member of the joint faculty of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health  Science and Technology  and an adjunct staff member in the Department of Cardiovascular Research of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. In 2003  he received the Lamb Medal of the Physics of Quantum Electronics Conference for the first experimental demonstrations of superradiance and the microlaser and for pioneering applications of optics to biological physics. In 2008  the Optical Society of America gave him its prestigious William F. Meggers Award in recognition of his major contributions to the foundations of laser spectroscopy and his pioneering developments in the application of spectroscopy to biomedicine.He is survived by his wife  Alison Hearn  and his three children  Alexandra  Jonathan and David.A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday  April 12  at the Levine Funeral Chapel  470 Harvard St in Brookline  Mass. Interment will be on Tuesday  April 13  in the family plot in Wellwood Cemetery  Pinelawn  N.Y. (Long Island). There will be a memorial service at MIT later this spring.A memorial service will be held at 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday  June 16  in the MIT Chapel.
Charles Batterman  longtime MIT diving coach  dies at age 87,Charles Julius Batterman  a former national diving champion and longtime MIT diving coach who was among the first to take a scientific approach to the sport  died March 31 in Peterborough  N.H. He was 87.Batterman was the subject of some of Harold Eugene “Doc” Edgerton’s strikingly beautiful stroboscopic photographs  which captured the diver at various points as he twirled through the air on his way to the water. But Batterman was best known professionally for authoringThe Techniques of Springboard Diving(MIT Press  1968)  the first book to apply physics principles to the analysis of dives. The book is illustrated both with Edgerton’s photographs and with Batterman’s own pen-and-ink drawings.“From the standpoint of mechanical analysis and the scientific approach  the book has no equal ” said Bob Webster  winner of gold medals at the 1960 and 1964 Olympics. Diver Bob Clotworthy wrote in the foreword to the book  “In 1956  I had the opportunity to be coached by Charlie Batterman. I was already a National Champion  and an Olympian  but in a few weekends I found out how little I really knew about diving. Charlie was the first one to stress the importance of the scientific approach.”Batterman was born June 10  1922  in Brooklyn  N.Y.  to parents who had emigrated as children from Eastern Europe. He attended Ohio State University  where he was a member of the school’s national-championship swimming teams in 1942 and 1943.He and his future wife  Ruth Lester Fink  met as teenage counselors at summer camp; they married in 1944. That same year  while he was earning his MA part-time at Columbia University  Batterman was National Inter-Collegiate and National AAU diving champion in both the high board and the low board. He was named to the honorary 1944 Olympic team (there were no Olympic games that year because of the war).Batterman  his wife and his infant daughter spent the summer at New York’s Jones Beach  where Batterman performed in diving shows in order to support his family. That and several jobs coaching high-school basketball disqualified him from competing in the 1948 Olympic games  on the grounds that he was a professional.In 1949  Batterman went to Harvard University as an assistant coach. In 1956 he was appointed assistant professor of physical education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  where he also coached swimming  diving  soccer  lacrosse and water polo.In 1968  he wrote a children’s book How to Star in Swimming and Diving. It was widely distributed through Scholastic Book Services and reprinted several times by Four Winds Press.In the summers of 1967 and 1968  under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State  Batterman traveled to Poland to set up training camps to prepare young Polish swimmers and divers for international competition. During his stay  the swimmers he coached broke between 15 and 20 Polish national records.Batterman officially retired from MIT in 1987. His New England colleagues in the diving and swimming community honored him by creating the Charles Batterman Men’s and Women’s Diving Coach of the Year awards and the annual Charlie Batterman Relays.In addition to being a teacher and an athlete  Batterman was an accomplished amateur artist and enjoyed painting watercolors. Among Batterman’s friends was American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein  his roommate at Ohio State; in 1942  Lichtenstein created an oil painting of Batterman’s feet soaking in a basin.“Charlie loved music  sang and danced and was the life of any party he attended. He was a true ‘lebenskunstler’ — an artist of life ” said longtime friend Ethan Bolker  noting that Batterman designed his icosahedral house in Hancock  N.H.  where he and Ruth lived after Batterman retired.His wife suffered a stroke  and for years afterward  Batterman cared for her himself in their Hancock house  despite the well-meant advice of friends and family who were sure the two of them could manage only in a retirement home. They were married for 60 years before her death in 2004.Batterman was also preceded in death by a daughter  Amy Beissel. He is survived by his son  Henry Batterman of Florence  Italy; his daughter  Nora Campbell  of Cambridge  Mass.; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

He was 57.Davine came to MIT in 1976 as a senior clerk in Service Process; beginning in 2006  Davine worked as an administrative officer in the Nuclear Reactor Laboratory.A native of Newton  Mass.  Davine graduated from Framingham State College in 1976 and attended the University of London  earning an MA degree in international relations in 1979. He earned an MBA from Bentley College in 1991.During his career at MIT  Davine also worked as an administrative officer in the Sea Grant College Program and the Center for International Studies. He also served as a senior business consultant in the MIT Administrative Computing Area  where he was known as a gifted teacher and for co-developing a financial management course for administrators. He was a member of MIT's Quarter Century Club.Known for his intelligence  good humor and comedic timing  Davine was well-read and passionate about politics. He also enjoyed golf  and was a founding member of the Duffers Tour of the north and south shores. He traveled to Canada and Britain to follow events on the PGA Tour.Services were held in early March. In lieu of flowers  expressions of sympathy in his memory may be made to the American Cancer Society  30 Speen St.  Framingham  MA 01701.
Nuclear engineer Thomas Pigford  former MIT professor  dies at age 87,Former MIT Professor Thomas Harrington Pigford SM ’48  ScD ‘52  who helped launch the Institute’s graduate program in nuclear engineering  died Sunday  Feb. 28  at his home in Oakland  Calif.  from complications of Parkinson's disease. He was 87.Pigford’s five-decade career in nuclear engineering spanned nuclear reactor design  nuclear safety  nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste management. He championed nuclear power  but not at the expense of appropriate safeguards for health and the environment. He was respected among scientists and environmentalists alike for his technical expertise and objectivity  and was appointed to numerous advisory commissions on nuclear reactor safety  including the Expert Consultant Group to Evaluate the Chernobyl Accident and the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island (TMI).Pigford was born April 21  1922  in Meridian  Miss.  where he attended school before leaving for college. He received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology  where he graduated magna cum laude in 1943. His graduate studies at MIT were interrupted when he joined the U.S. Navy  where he served in the Pacific during the last stages of World War II. He was discharged with the rank of lieutenant junior grade at the end of the war and returned to MIT to continue his studies.While still completing his doctorate  Pigford was asked to join the MIT faculty — he became associate professor of nuclear and chemical engineering in 1955 — and his career there included a two-year stint as director of the MIT Graduate School of Engineering Practice at Oak Ridge  Tenn. Pigford transferred back to MIT from Oak Ridge in 1952  the same year he helped Benedict inaugurate MIT's new graduate program in nuclear engineering.At the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  Pigford also held a position as senior development engineer with the Aqueous Homogenous Nuclear Reactor Project. From 1957-1959  he was a founding staff member at General Atomic  now called General Atomics  at the time a nuclear technology research and development firm based in La Jolla  Calif.In 1959  Pigford was recruited to the UC Berkeley faculty as a full professor by Nobel Laureate Glenn Seaborg  who was UC Berkeley chancellor at the time. Pigford became the first permanent chair of the nuclear engineering department  which had just been elevated to a full department from a graduate studies program. He also held a position as a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Pigford retired from UC Berkeley in 1991 and became professor emeritus.Pigford's first wife  Catherine Pigford  died in 1992. He is survived by his second wife  Elizabeth Pigford of Oakland  Calif.; his daughters from his first marriage  Cynthia Pigford Naylor of Durham  Calif.  and Julie Pigford Earnest of Portland  Ore.; and his step-daughters from his second marriage  Janvrin Demler of Dedham  Mass.  and Laura Weekes of Los Angeles  Calif.

Professor Emeritus Norman D. Ham  helicopter rotor design expert  dies at age 80,MIT Professor Emeritus Norman D. Ham SM ’52  AE ’57  ScD ‘68  an aeronautical engineer who was internationally recognized for his expertise in helicopter rotor design  died at home on Feb. 13  2010. The Brookline  Mass.  resident was 80 years old.Known to many in the aeronautical industry as the “father of individual-blade-control ” Ham contributed extensively to the rotorcraft community. A 1951 graduate of the University of Toronto  he received advanced degrees in aeronautics from MIT. After nearly a decade of work in the aircraft industry in Canada  he continued his career in the United Kingdom as senior engineer for the Fairey Aviation Co.  focusing on the design of the Rotodyne compound helicopter.He returned to the United States  where he was employed by Doman Helicopters in Danbury  Conn.  to assist in certification of the Model LZ-5 helicopter  a particularly unique design that was advanced for its time and was later incorporated into the V-22 Osprey. At Doman  he contributed to the design of the Doman-Fleet DF-7 for the Royal Canadian Navy. Ham joined the faculty of the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1962. At MIT  he founded and directed the VTOL Technology Laboratory  and conducted pioneering research on dynamic stall  stall flutter  individual blade control and gust response for helicopter rotors. His skill as a lecturer at MIT was reflected in the warm and longstanding relationships he held with many of his former students up to the time of his death.Before and after Ham’s retirement  industry leaders and litigators regularly solicited his technical knowledge. He consulted extensively for NASA and for aircraft companies including Boeing  Honeywell and Raytheon  and regularly presented papers for AHS International  a Vertical Flight Society.Ham wrote more than 40 scholarly papers and received numerous industry awards. In 1953  he won the Cierva Memorial Prize from the Helicopter Association of Great Britain. In 1995  he was recognized with a Certificate of Appreciation by the NASA Ames Research Center  and in 2001  he was honored by the American Helicopter Society for his outstanding achievements and contributions to vertical flight technology. In 2002  he was selected as an Honorary Member of the Society’s Education Committee.A natural athlete  Ham played tennis regularly for most of his life and was a skilled competitive curler.

Services were private.
Carl Kaysen  MIT professor emeritus and national security expert  dies at age 89,National security expert Carl Kaysen  MIT’s David W. Skinner Professor of Political Economy  Emeritus  and former director of the Institute’s Program in Science  Technology  and Society  died on Feb. 8 at his home in Cambridge. He was 89.A trained economist  Kaysen broadened his interests early in his career and participated in significant national-security initiatives as a high-level official in the Kennedy administration. Later Kaysen spent a decade as director of theInstitute for Advanced Studyin Princeton  N.J.  and  having joined MIT in 1976  served as director of the Institute’s Program in Science  Technology  and Society during the 1980s.A native of Philadelphia  Kaysen received his BA from the University of Pennsylvania in 1940. During World War II  he worked as an economist for the United States Office of Strategic Services  then in intelligence matters for the U.S. Army Air Force. After the war  Kaysen resumed his studies  earning an MA from Harvard in 1947  and then a PhD from Harvard in economics in 1954. Harvard named him a professor of economics in 1957.One of many scholars recruited from Cambridge to join the Kennedy administration  Kaysen served from 1961 to 1963 as deputy special assistant for national security affairs. In a 2008 interview with MIT’s Center for International Studies  Kaysen stated that his work on the team negotiating the Limited Test Ban Treaty between the United States  the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom was among the proudest moments of his career. Signed in 1963  the treaty prohibited all nuclear test detonations except those underground. “I treasure a photo of the president  [Averell] Harriman  and me in Hyannis Port when we got back from Moscow ” Kaysen said.After leaving Washington  Kaysen returned to Harvard  before leaving once again to become director of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study from 1966 to 1976. While at the institute  he founded its School of Social Science.When he once again returned to Cambridge  he joined MIT and directed the Institute’s new program on Science  Technology  and Society from 1981 to 1987. In retirement  Kaysen remained an active scholar  affiliated with the MIT Center for International Studies; he was also co-chair of the Study Committee on International Security Studies for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  of which he was a fellow.In recent years  Kaysen was a critic of U.S. foreign policy  saying the war in Iraq was “invented for a perfectly implausible purpose.” In 2002  Kaysen helped produce a study for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  “War with Iraq: Costs  Consequences  and Alternatives ” which weighed the implications of war in Iraq; he also remained committed to an internationalist view of policymaking. “To the extent that there is an international rule of law which constrains both others and us  we’ll live in a more orderly and peaceful world ” Kaysen asserted.In his 2008 interview with CIS  when asked to cite career highlights  Kaysen also recalled “a certain thrill” after publishing his first book  in 1957 — an economic analysis of an anti-trust case between the government and the United Shoe Machinery Corporation. “I didn’t expect it to become a bestseller  and it didn’t ” he quipped. In all  Kaysen wrote  co-authored or edited several books or reports  including “Antitrust policy: an economic and legal analysis” (with Donald F. Turner  1959)  a lecture series titled  “The higher learning  the universities  and the public” (1969)  and “Emerging norms of justified intervention ” (1993) a look at military engagements.Colleagues remember Kaysen as a conscientious intellectual who analyzed issues thoroughly before arriving at his conclusions. “Carl was a very soft-spoken  solid person ” said Professor of Political Science Emeritus Eugene Skolnikoff. “He obviously thought before he talked  and always made a lot of sense.”Kaysen was preceded in death by his first wife of 50 years  Annette Neutra Kaysen. He is survived by his wife  Ruth Butler; and his daughters  Susanna Kaysen  of Cambridge  and Jesse Kaysen  of Madison  Wisc.In lieu of flowers  donations in Kaysen's memory may be made to the John F. Kennedy Kennedy Library or to the Cambridge Public Library.A memorial service at a date yet to be announced will be held in Cambridge. The MIT News Office will release details when they become available.
Zipporah Levinson  Department of Mathematics’ ‘den mother ’ dies at age 93,Zipporah “Fagi” Levinson  the wife of the late Institute Professor Norman Levinson ’34  SM ’34  SCD ’35  died on Dec. 11  2009  at the age of 93 after numerous strokes and pneumonia.In the bookRecountings: Conversations with MIT Mathematicians  editor Joel Segel described Levinson as “the unquestioned ‘den mother’” for decades to the likes of Norbert Weiner and John Nash ” and “a vibrant and irreplaceable part of the Mathematics Department’s institutional memory and perhaps the person best qualified to put a human face on the period when the department was coming into its own as a full-fledged research entity.”Levinson was particularly effective as the moral and social historian of the department  and was frequently called upon to remind them of the Institute’s history  including its anti-Semitism and sexism  and how it had overcome them.Levinson was born in 1916 in what she described as a tough Jewish ghetto in Brooklyn  the daughter of a dentist and dental technician. She was educated at City College of New York and was awarded her masters in education by Columbia. In 1938 she met Norman Levinson  who was then a young instructor in the MIT Department of Mathematics  and he proposed to her two days later. They married after knowing each other for only a week  and the department acknowledged the wedding by presenting her with a copy ofCalculus Made Easy  signed by all members of the faculty.Levinson often opened up her house to other mathematicians  providing a congenial and supportive environment  which was greatly appreciated by the rapidly expanding department. After her husband became head of the department and an Institute Professor  Fagi continued to act as the department’s social glue. After his death in 1975  she remained an active participant in the social life of several generations of the department  ultimately becoming the department’s oral historian.She spent the last nine years of her life at Lasell Village in Newton. Until shortly before her death she stayed in touch with numerous friends from the mathematical world. She is survived by two daughters  Sylvia and Joan (Zorza) ’62  four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.Donations may be made to MIT noting they are in memory of Fagi Levinson (and/or Norman Levinson) and sent to Bonny Kellermann  MIT director of memorial gifts  600 Memorial Drive  Room W98-516  Cambridge  MA 02139. Donations will fund opportunities for undergraduate research in applied mathematics.
Professor Emeritus of Architecture Eduardo Catalano dies at age 92,MIT Professor Emeritus of Architecture Eduardo Catalano  who designed numerous buildings around the world including a 1954 North Carolina modernist home that was hailed as the “House of the Decade ” died Thursday in Cambridge. He was 92.Born in Buenos Aires  Argentina  Catalano taught at MIT from 1956 to 1977 and designed the Institute’s Stratton Student Center. Prior to working at MIT  he pioneered the architectural development of shell structures  beginning with his own home  Raleigh House  built in 1954 after he arrived to teach at the School of Design in Raleigh  N.C.The three-bedroom house  set on a wooded lot at the end of a quiet street  featured a 4 000 square-foot hyperbolic paraboloid as its roof. Sheltered beneath the shoehorn-shaped roof was a square interior enclosed entirely in glass. The undulation of the roof provided openness in some areas and privacy in others.“It is refreshing to see that the shelter  that is the most important element in domestic architecture  has been so imaginatively and skillfully treated as in this house by Eduardo Catalano ” Frank Lloyd Wright said of Raleigh House in the August 1956 issue ofHouse and Home Magazine  which named it the “House of the Decade.”Catalano sold the house when he moved to Cambridge to teach at MIT. Years of neglect culminated in the house's demolition in 2001  an event mourned by preservationists.Catalano sought harmony in science  technology and the visual arts. He designed the U.S. embassies in Buenos Aires and in Pretoria  and the Juilliard School of Music at New York City's Lincoln Center. In addition to his buildings  Catalano designed and donated a stainless steel sculpture to the city of Buenos Aires in 2002. The 75-foot high Floralis Generica  which has since become a city landmark  has petals that open and close at dawn and dusk.He is survived by his son and daughter.

Jack Wozencraft  information theorist at MIT  1925-2009,John M. “Jack” Wozencraft  former professor emeritus in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  died peacefully on Aug. 31  2009  at his home in Redmond  Wash.Born in Dallas  on Sept. 30  1925  Wozencraft was considered one of the pioneers of coding theory. He developed the sequential decoding techniques for convolutional codes that made error-free communication possible with relatively low computing power — enabling the subsequent development of modern strategies used by the Internet  cellular phones  and deep-space transmissions.Wozencraft attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point  N.Y. Following graduation in 1946  he joined the Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory. He received his ScD at MIT in 1957. From 1957 to 1976  when he retired  he served on the MIT Electrical Engineering Department faculty.In addition to teaching and research  Wozencraft authored numerous articles  consulted for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the Defense Communications Agency  and was appointed to the President’s Science Advisory Council. During the years 1966-69  Wozencraft became interested in the area of programming languages as documented in various editions of course notes entitled "Notes on Programming Linguistics" (with Arthur Evans Jr.) issued to undergraduate students in computer science at MIT during that period.His 1967 book co-authored with Irwin Jacobs  SM ’57  PhD ’59  "Principles of Communication Engineering " was regarded as the definitive text in communications theory for more than 20 years and remains widely used today.While on a leave of absence from MIT (1972–1974)  he served as Dean of Research at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey  Calif. Following his retirement from MIT in 1976  he returned to the Naval Postgraduate School as professor of electrical engineering and the founding chairman of a new interdisciplinary command  control  and communications academic group. He was appointed distinguished professor in 1985  and he retired in 1987.In 2006  Wozencraft was awarded the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal.Despite these many accomplishments  Wozencraft invariably claimed that the high point of his life was marrying Frances Trask in 1963 during an eclipse of the sun. “We entered the church in the dark ” he wrote  “and came out into sparkling sunlight which has stayed with us ever since.”Wozencraft is survived by his wife Fran; their three children  John  Colin  and Katie; and two grandchildren.Contributions in memory of Wozencraft may be made either to the Sunriver Christian Fellowship (PMB 18160 Cottonwood Road  Sunriver  OR 97707) or the Redmond Presbyterian Church (10020 166th Ave. NE  Redmond  WA 98052.)More information

Letter from President Hockfield on the death of Howard Johnson,Dear members of the MIT community With the death last Saturday of Howard Johnson  MIT's president from 1966 to 1971  the Institute has lost an extraordinary leader  and a devoted advisor and friend. Howard Johnson's presidency coincided with a period of unprecedented upheaval on college campuses across the country.  With empathy  optimism and unwavering confidence in the core values of MIT  President Johnson guided the Institute through the profound political storms of the period.As his obituary conveys  he was both a strikingly effective leader and a deeply wise human being.In his memory  the flags in Killian Court have been lowered to half-staff. In the coming months  a memorial service will publicly honor the life and accomplishments of this great servant to MIT.I know you join me extending our deepest sympathies to the Johnson family.Sincerely Susan HockfieldPresident  Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Former MIT President Howard W. Johnson dies at age 87,Former MIT President Howard Wesley Johnson  who drew upon his management acumen to guide the Institute during the tumultuous late 1960s  died Saturday. He was 87.Johnson  who also served as chair of the MIT Corporation  became the 12th president of MIT in 1966 after serving seven years as dean of the Sloan School of Management.“Howard Johnson’s combination of buoyant optimism  extraordinary integrity and deep wisdom enabled him to steer a course well beyond the daily fray. Drawing on these remarkable qualities  he guided MIT through its most turbulent chapter ” said MIT President Susan Hockfield. “He continued to serve the Institute as a loyal friend and advisor all his life  and I was a most fortunate beneficiary. MIT is extraordinarily lucky to have had the benefit of his leadership and his devotion.”At the Institute’s helm from 1966 until 1971  a tumultuous period for universities around the nation  Johnson gained respect for listening to all sides and for combining progressive views on issues such as Vietnam and the environment with expertise in management. Johnson described those times in his book Holding the Center: Memoirs of a Life in Higher Education  published in 1999.“Students have told me  and I agree with them  that they found the institute to be academically vibrant during that time despite the uproar ” he wrote. “Much that was positive emerged from the upheaval  and  as in the aftermath of every revolution  it is important to build upon the good results and minimize the damage. That is what we tried to do at MIT  sometimes with success.”Kathryn Willmore  former vice president and secretary of the Corporation  described working with Johnson an “extraordinary experience.”"He was a humanist in the broadest sense of the word  appreciating and fostering the many disciplines that give richness and meaning to an education and to a life " Willmore said. "Calm in the midst of the storm  unfailingly good humored  with a sparkling wit and intelligence  he had a keen sense of what to do in virtually any difficult situation - no matter how big or small. In the midst of the most serious campus confrontations in the late sixties  including the takeover of his office  he refused to act with force  choosing to rely on patience and discussion instead. And it worked."MIT President Emeritus Paul Gray said  “Johnson’s great contributions could not have been done by his predecessor or his successor. He kept the Institute from flying apart when there was so much concern  so much noisy demonstration and so much division on the point of view of how the Institute should respond to claims it was helping the war effort.”“It was an enormous contribution that he made  and in my view  it has made all the difference to MIT in the years since because there was no fracture in the faculty or lingering resentment in the way things were handled ” Gray said.That Johnson knew many members of the faculty was a great help  but it was his ability to be a good listener that made Johnson a true leader  according to Gray.“He had this touch at just the right moment with a little humor that took the tension out of things ” Gray recalled. “Not everyone had it. I certainly didn’t have it  and that right touch was part of his personality and management style.”Gray recalled a number of long-lasting changes that were accomplished during Johnson’s administration  including the creation of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and the Independent Activities Period (IAP). The change from full-letter grades to pass-no credit for freshmen was also introduced during his administration.Johnson oversaw such major initiatives as the opening of several new residence halls (Eastgate in 1967  Random Hall and the east wing of McCormick Hall in 1968 and MacGregor House in 1970). MIT faculty members also received Nobel Prizes in three consecutive years during his tenure: Har Gobind Khorana in 1968  Salvador E. Luria in 1969 and Paul A. Samuelson in 1970.He said of his presidency upon resigning  “They have been the best years of my life. They have been years of strength for MIT as well.”He went on to serve as chair of the MIT Corporation from 1971 to 1983 and served on numerous governmental panels and as a trustee or director of such institutions as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  Radcliffe College  the Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was a Corporation Life Member Emeritus since 1997."Howard Johnson was a man we all thought was ageless " said MIT President Emeritus Charles M. Vest. "I frequently sought Howard's counsel  and always found him to be calm  thoughtful and incisive. He was an active participant in MIT Corporation meetings during my presidency. He brought to the Corporation a precise and important 'corporate memory ' yet was very much on top of issues of the day."Born to a Scandinavian family in Chicago in 1922  Johnson received his BA from Central College in Chicago in 1943 and his MA from the University of Chicago in 1947. He was on the faculty of the University of Chicago from 1948 to 1955  when he came to MIT as associate professor of management and director of the Sloan Fellowship Program. He became professor and dean of the Sloan School of Management in 1959  serving until 1966.His public service includes membership on the National Commission on Productivity  the National Manpower Advisory Committee  the (U.S.) President's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy  and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital.Johnson is survived by his wife  Elizabeth (Weed) Johnson  and three children: Stephen Johnson  of Medford  Mass.; Laura Johnson  of Concord  Mass.; and Bruce Johnson  of Mendocino  Calif. He is also survived by three grandchildren: Luke Johnson Rogers  James Lion Johnson and Oliver Lion Johnson.Memorial gifts may be made to the Howard W. and Elizabeth W. Johnson Fund at MIT.
Nobel-winning economist Paul A. Samuelson dies at age 94,MIT economist Paul A. Samuelson  the Nobel laureate whose mathematical analysis provided the foundation on which modern economics is built and whose textbook influenced generations of students  died today at his home in Belmont  Mass. He was 94.Samuelson  an Institute Professor Emeritus and Gordon Y Billard Fellow at MIT  was one of the world’s leading economists for more than half a century. When he became the first American to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics in 1970  a year after the prize was created  the Swedish Royal Academy said that he “has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory.”Twenty-six years later  in 1996  when he was awarded a National Medal of Science  America’s top science honor  President Bill Clinton praised his “fundamental contributions to economic science  specifically general equilibrium theory and macroeconomics  and to economic education and policy over a period of 60 years.”Samuelson’s contributions to the field were so numerous and fundamental that they lend themselves to description in more general terms. "If you did a time and motion study of what any modern economist does at work  you would find that an enormous proportion of standard mental devices trace back to Paul Samuelson's long lifetime of research ” said MIT Institute Professor Emeritus Robert Solow. “What I can add about my beloved friend of 60 years is that he had a marvelous intuition about how a market economy had to be. 'It must work like this ' he would say. 'Now all we have to do is prove it.' There was no one like him."Samuelson was instrumental in bringing the MIT Department of Economics  which did not train graduate students when he joined it in 1940  to its current stature as a world-renowned research and teaching institution. Reflecting on this at a dinner in 1991 celebrating the establishment of the department’s Samuelson Chair in Economics  Samuelson referred to the department’s development as a “scientific miracle.” Admonishing the audience not to believe “that this was my handiwork alone ” he said that the department  from 1941 to 1960  “went from being a mediocre service department to becoming No. 1 on all foundations’ ranking of departments.” In fact  he quipped  by the mid-1960s the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division was starting to fret about MIT's garnering of most of the National Science Foundation fellowships awarded in economics.“Two factors explain our success ” Samuelson wrote in 2000. “One  MIT's renaissance after World War II as a federally supported research resource. Two  the mathematical revolution in macro- and micro-economic theory and statistics: this was overdue and inevitable — MIT was the logical place for it to flourish.”As MIT President Susan Hockfield framed it  “Paul Samuelson transformed everything he touched: the theoretical foundations of his field  the way economics was taught around the world  the ethos and stature of his department  the investment practices of MIT  and the lives of his colleagues and students. Intellectually and personally  his vision created the intensely collaborative culture of MIT's Department of Economics  and in everything he did  he represented the very best of MIT.”‘One of the giants’Samuelson produced the best-selling economics text of all time  Economics: An Introductory Analysis. First published in 1948 and originally prepared for MIT’s then-mandatory undergraduate economics course  Samuelson’s textbook was the first to explain the principles of Keynesian economics to beginning economics students. It has been translated into 40 languages  and is now in its 19th edition in English. The textbook has sold nearly four million copies over a span of 60 years.Samuelson’s textbook influenced generations of students  said James Poterba  MIT’s Mitsui Professor of Economics and former head of MIT’s Department of Economics. He noted that for decades  future scholars  policy-makers  and business executives were introduced to contemporary economics by Samuelson’s book. “He leaves an immense legacy  as a researcher and a teacher  as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands ” Poterba said.In the area of policy  Samuelson never held a major government post but  true to his belief that economists should be involved in social issues  he served as an adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and was a consultant to government  foundations and companies. He also commented frequently on economic policy matters and for years made his views known to the public through a column inNewsweekmagazine.Often referred to as an economist’s economist  Samuelson once wrote: “In this age of specialization  I sometimes think of myself as the last ‘generalist’ in economics. My interests range from mathematical economics to current financial journalism.”Samuelson continued to work long after his official retirement in 1985  arriving at his office at MIT regularly and remaining an active member of the department. Displaying his well-known wit  he told the gathering celebrating the Samuelson Chair  “That’s what I would like to do until the end of time — to go on scribbling my articles on the third floor of the Sloan Building  in between playing tennis and drinking coffee at my other study in the Concord Avenue branch of Burger King.”Ricardo Caballero  the Ford International Professor of Economics and head of MIT’s Department of Economics  said Samuelson remained a central figure in all the department’s gatherings until the very end.“He always had the last — and the first — word  and deservedly so ” Caballero said. “We will miss him and his unmatched wit very much  but his intellectual legacy is enormous and perennial. The world is different today because he was with us for many years."International acclaimPaul Anthony Samuelson was born in Gary  Ind.  on May 15  1915. He received a BS from the University of Chicago in 1935  an MA in 1936 from Harvard University and the PhD  with a David A. Wells Prize  from Harvard in 1941. He was an early Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows.He was appointed an assistant professor of economics at MIT in 1940  associate professor in 1944  and full professor in 1947. In 1966  he was named Institute Professor  MIT’s highest faculty honor.Even as a graduate student at Harvard  Samuelson won international acclaim and made significant contributions to economic theory. Confronted by contradictions  overlaps and fallacies in the classical language of economics  he sought unification — and clarification — in mathematics.In his first major work  Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947)  which was also his PhD thesis  he told economists that they had been practicing “mental gymnastics of a particularly depraved type ” and were like “highly trained athletes who never ran a race.” He did not claim mathematics would cure the ills of economic analysis  but he did insist that mathematics was essential.The Swedish Royal Academy said in its Nobel citation that in this first book and in a large number of articles as well  Samuelson had “rewritten considerable parts of central economic theory and has in several areas achieved results which now rank among the classical theories of economics.”In his work on the theory of balance between prices and supply and demand  the academy said  Samuelson had succeeded in “formulating the theory in mathematical terms. The matter of approach  how to handle this problem  is what his contribution was.”As an adviser to Kennedy and Johnson  Samuelson advocated tax cuts and the war on poverty. In 1974  he was one of 21 economists to attend President Gerald Ford’s two-day “inflation summit conference.” There  he said America had been stricken with a bad case of “stagflation” — the toxic mix of high unemployment and high inflation over long periods of time.In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize and National Medal of Science  Samuelson was the inaugural winner of the John Bates Clark Medal  the American Economic Association's award for the best American economist under the age of 40  in 1947. He served as president of the American Economic Association and the Econometric Society. He was the author of hundreds of articles in professional journals and magazines  and served as associate editor and a member of the advisory and editorial boards of several professional journals. The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson have been published in five volumes  containing about 400 articles  by the MIT Press. Another 200 papers will be published in volumes 6 and 7  now in progress.His memberships and fellowships included the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the British Academy  Phi Beta Kappa  the International Economic Association (president  1965-68 and lifetime honorary president)  the National Academy of Sciences  where he served on the Finance Committee from 1977 until 2009  and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Samuelson was a distinguished lecturer at more than 20 colleges  universities and professional societies  and received 35 honorary degrees.He is survived by his wife of 28 years  Risha Samuelson; six children from his first marriage to the late Marion Crawford Samuelson: Jane Samuelson Raybould  of London; Marnie Crawford Samuelson  of Brookline  Mass.; William Samuelson and his wife  Susan  of Belmont  Mass.; Robert Samuelson and his wife  Kristin  of Boston; John Samuelson and his wife  Gail  of Sherborn  Mass.; and Paul Samuelson and his wife  Martha  of Newton  Mass; and a stepdaughter  Susan Miller  of Lexington  Mass. He is also survived by 15 grandchildren.In lieu of flowers  the family requests that donations be made to the Massachusetts Audubon Society  208 South Great Road  Lincoln  MA 01793.Funeral arrangements will be private. Amemorial servicefor Samuelson is scheduled for Saturday  April 10  at 11 a.m.
Memorial service for Leo Osgood to be held Dec. 11,A memorial service for Leo Osgood will be held at 10 a.m. on Friday  Dec. 11  in the MIT Chapel.Osgood  who in his many roles at MIT had a profound impact on the students  faculty and staff with whom he worked  died Nov. 11 after a long illness. In the course of his career at MIT  Osgood served as an associate dean and director of the Office of Minority Education  dean on call  associate professor  and coach of the MIT men's basketball team.The memorial service will be followed by a reception in W11.
Leo Osgood  former basketball coach  dean and OME director  dies,Leo Osgood  who in his many roles at MIT had a profound impact on the students  faculty and staff with whom he worked  died Nov. 11 after a long illness.During the course of his career  Osgood served as an associate dean and director of the Office of Minority Education  dean on call  associate professor  and coach of the MIT men's basketball team; his legacy has many dimensions through which run consistent themes of leadership  caring  tenacity and inspiration. In reflecting on his passing  one of his coworkers described him as "welcoming  demanding  and caring. He encouraged you to do your best and wanted to help you achieve your dreams."Osgood began his career at MIT in 1977 as an assistant basketball coach and became head coach in 1986  a position he would hold for the next nine years. In 1983  while his coaching responsibilities grew to associate coach  Osgood's role was expanded to assistant dean in the counseling section of the Office of the Dean for Student Affairs. For the next 12 years  he was the sole dean on call  helping students work through academic and personal emergencies after hours. In this role  he personally touched the lives of many students often in their most desperate time of need.In 1986  Osgood added assistant professor in athletics to his broad range of responsibilities and contributions. Once again  his drive for excellence and his ability to connect with students shone through. A faculty member who worked with Osgood in Athletics described him as "a caring and excellent teacher. He was always prepared and sought to have the students get to know each other  rather than just come to class. I really admired that about Leo. He truly cared about the students  their learning process  and developing community at MIT. "During the next decade  Osgood was active and thoroughly engaged in fostering the development of underrepresented students  faculty and staff at MIT. He was on the faculty advisory board of the Office of Minority Education (OME) and was a significant contributor to OME's Interphase  a summer program that provides academic enrichment  confidence and community building for newly admitted freshmen. At the same time  he co-chaired MIT's Martin Luther King Jr. Committee as it conceived and initiated the Martin Luther King Jr. Visiting Scholars Program  and he co-chaired a presidential task force for career development of underrepresented minority administrators at the Institute. His demonstrated leadership  commitment and ability to connect with students led to his appointment as associate dean and director of the Office of Minority Education in 1995. He served in this role until he retired from MIT in 2006.In 1990  the late Constantine Simonides  vice president and secretary of the Corporation  praised Osgood's leadership at MIT: "He is someone that young people can look up to for his accomplishments " Simonides said. "He is a disciplined coach who is both kind and tough  a combination that may be a requirement for success at MIT  but represents a balance very difficult to achieve."A native of Charleston  S.C.  Osgood came to Boston as a young boy. He earned a BS in business administration and an MS in education from Northeastern  where he was a highly successful basketball player. When he graduated in 1970  he was Northeastern's fifth all-time leading scorer with more than 1 000 career points. Osgood was inducted into the Northeastern's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989.Osgood was one of a core group of administrative leaders who contributed to the personal and professional successes of many MIT graduates. In the words of MIT President Emeritus Charles M. Vest  this group "enabled the MIT student body to become remarkably diverse." For several generations of underrepresented students  Osgood provided guidance and support; at times he was a lifeline. In "Technology and the Dream " Dr. Clarence Williams' book of personal reflections on the Black experience at MIT  former students cited Osgood as "one of the most influential people in (my) MIT years" in terms of their adjustment to and perseverance at MIT. For them  Osgood was a consistent and essential mentor who  "whatever foolishness I might have been going through " was "still willing to listen and help me out."Osgood is survived by his mother  Sara Mitchell Osgood; his daughter  Pia Briscoe  of North Haven  Conn.; and numerous other relatives.Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday  Nov. 18  at Twelfth Baptist Church  150 Warren Street in Boston. Visitation will take place the night before  from 5 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at Davis Funeral Home  654 Cummins Highway in Mattapan.Condolences can be offerd on theDavis Funeral Home web site. In lieu of flowers  the family asks that donations be made to The Leo Osgood Education Scholarship Fund Bank of America-BaySide Mall  1104 Massachusetts Ave.  Dorchester  MA 02125.A memorial service is being organized for the MIT community.

Inventor  lawyer and lecturer Robert H. Rines dies aged 87,Robert H. Rines  an internationally recognized patent lawyer  inventor  musical composer and Loch Ness monster hunter who lectured at MIT from 1963 until his retirement last year  died on Sunday  Nov. 1. He was 87.Born in 1922 in Boston  Rines received his bachelor’s degree in physics from MIT in 1942. At the Institute  he developed his first contributions to the emerging technology of high-resolution image-scanning radar. After serving as a radar officer in World War II in both the European and Pacific theaters  Rines received a law degree from Georgetown University while serving as a patent examiner in the United States Patent Office.He returned to New England after law school  joined his father’s law practice  and began lecturing on patent law at Harvard. While at Harvard  Rines wrote “Create or Perish ” a book that would later became the cornerstone text for two classes — 6.901 and 6.931 —that he would teach at MIT.At the encouragement of EECS Professor Lan Jen Chu and several other professors under whom he studied at MIT  Rines transferred his teaching to the Institute in 1963. His two classes focused on using intellectual property to start new companies and nurturing entrepreneurship and innovation. He taught his final class in the spring of 2008.“We've lost a tremendous advocate for those who have deep technical training as a first base  and go on to shape law and policy around the globe ” Dedric Carter  assistant dean of engineering at MIT  said this week.During his 45 years of teaching at MIT  Rines continued his active research and inventing  earning more than 100 patents — many for electronic apparatus to improve the resolution of radar and sonar scanning. The scanning systems used to locate the wrecks of the Titanic and the Bismarck were dependent on Rines’ prototypes  as were medical ultrasound imaging systems.In 1963  Rines founded the Academy of Applied Science  a private  non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology education at all levels. In 1973  he founded the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord  N.H.— now among the country’s foremost institutes for the study of intellectual property law. In 1994  Rines was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.Beyond teaching  mentoring  inventing and running an award-winning patent practice  Rines pursued scientific knowledge and discovery throughout his life. As documented by Public Television’s Nova series  Rines joined MIT’s Harold “Doc” Edgerton in the 1970s in a bid to provide evidence of the Loch Ness creature in Scotland.Using Rines’ inventions in radar and sonar imaging and Edgerton’s stroboscopic photography  they were able to produce a partial image of the Ness creature’s outline and size  but the findings were not conclusive. Still  Rines maintained that he had  in fact  caught a glimpse of the creature. “I had the misfortune of seeing one of these things with my own eyes ” he told The Boston Globe in 2008.Rines also wrote music for more than 10 Broadway and off-Broadway shows. He shared an Emmy in 1987 for his composition for the television production of “Hizzoner The Mayor.”In addition to his wife  Joanne Hayes-Rines  Rines leaves two sons  Justice of New York and Robert of Concord  N.H.; a daughter  Suzi Rines Toth of Duxbury  Mass.; a stepdaughter  Laura Hayes-Heuer of Washington; and four grandchildren.A Memorial Service will be held at 4 p.m. Saturday  Nov. 7  in the Palm Garden Room of the Boston Marriott Long Wharf.
Remembering David Schauer,After finishing her MIT PhD in 2007  Megan McBee ’02 stayed on as a postdoctoral associate in David Schauer’s lab. She was having trouble deciding what she wanted to do next  and debating whether she wanted to pursue an academic career.Finally Schauer told her  in his usual gentle way  “You need to move on  Megan. There’s nothing more I have to teach you.” Soon after  McBee realized the reason she didn’t want to leave MIT was her fond attachment to Schauer’s lab  which she called her “academic family.”That academic family gathered Friday afternoon  along with many members of Schauer’s actual family  for a symposium to celebrate his life and many contributions to MIT. Schauer  a professor in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and Division of Comparative Medicine  died on June 7 at the age of 48 after a sudden illness.Speakers from every stage of Schauer’s academic life recalled a youthful and eager scientist with a constant smile and a devotion to scientific rigor. His scientific career was devoted to studying disease-causing microbes  but his impact also extended to MIT’s curriculum  where he was committed to creating the best possible education for students  said Douglas Lauffenburger  head of MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering.As one of the first faculty members in that department  Schauer proved to be a “voice of integration and unity” that was vital to the department’s merging of engineers and scientists  Lauffenburger said. “He was universally loved  and that’s not a trivial statement — especially in academia.”Colleagues often sought out Schauer not only to soothe the friction that can often arise in academic departments  but also for his wise counsel. “Even now  when complicated issues come up  I think  ‘what would David do  what would he say about this?’” said MIT biology professor Alan Grossman  who worked with Schauer to set up a new graduate program in microbiology.Professor Peter Dedon  who planned the symposium with James Fox and Steve Tannenbaum  declared at the outset that it was “a happy event ” devoted to a celebration of Schauer’s life and carrying on his legacy.“Just as I hear myself channeling my parents when I talk to my own kids  when I talk to my own graduate students and postdocs I realize I’m channeling David ” said Vincent Young ’85  an assistant professor at University of Michigan Medical School  who was Schauer’s first postdoc at MIT.And McBee  who recalled that she was so nervous before asking Schauer if she could work in his lab that she downed a grande quadruple iced Americano to fortify herself for the meeting  said she is devoted to passing on what she has learned from her adviser.“He was my academic father  and I am going to try to be a mentor to other students the way he was to me ” McBee said.
Of Note: Symposium this Friday to celebrate the life of David Schauer,The Department of Biological Engineering will hold a symposium this Friday  Oct. 30  in honor of Professor David Schauer who died in June.The symposium  "Gut Microbes and Cancer - A Pioneer's Passion " will celebrate Schauer's professional life  with a focus on microbial disease.Schauer researched the development of bacterial diseases  with a particular focus on understanding how bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract leads to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease  hepatitis and cancer.

Schauer  a professor of biological engineering and comparative medicine  had been a member of the MIT faculty for 16 years when he died June 7  2009  at the age of 48.Schauer was widely respected for his clear and calm approach to problem solving  both in and out of the lab  and was highly rated as a teacher.

The symposium will be held in Killian Hall (14W-111)  from 1 to 5 p.m. A reception will follow at 5 p.m.

Richard Yamamoto  physics professor  dies at 74,Richard Yamamoto  a physicist whose work revealed the interactions of subatomic particles  died today at the age of 74 from complications of lung cancer.Yamamoto  who was born and raised in Hawaii  came to MIT as a freshman in 1953 and spent his entire career at the Institute. He was known for his love of working with his hands as well as his contributions to understanding elementary particles  according to colleagues."He loved to work with students  making things " says Peter Fisher  division head of particle and nuclear experimental physics  who began working with Yamamoto in 1994. "He was happiest when he had his hands on some knob  adjusting a mirror  and looking at an oscilloscope."Yamamoto worked for many years on experiments at Fermilab and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center  where his team showed that a type of particular interaction called a weak interaction appeared differently if viewed in a mirror - a phenomenon known as a parity violation  not seen in any other particle interactions. As part of that work  he devised a way to use a laser to accurately count the number of left-handed and right-handed electrons in a beam of electrons. They used this method to measure the interaction strength of a particle called the Z boson  a heavy elementary particle first discovered in 1983.Fisher recalled that Yamamoto's team at Stanford had some difficulty figuring out why two different electron-counting methods were producing different results  but the director of the accelerator center was pressuring the team to publish their results. Yamamoto insisted on waiting until they figured out why their numbers were off  which they eventually did."Dick was a mild-mannered guy  but when push came to shove  he stood up to the system " Fisher says.Yamamoto's research team also carried out very precise studies of how particles containing heavy quarks would decay if time flowed backward.Yamamoto earned his bachelor's degree and PhD  both in physics  from MIT in 1957 and 1963  respectively. He joined MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science in 1963 and became an instructor of physics in 1964. He joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1965 and became a full professor in 1972."Dick was a wonderful colleague  teacher  and friend to many faculty  staff and students " says Edmund Bertschinger  head of the physics department. "His kindness and gentle enthusiasm helped make the department an exciting and supportive place for everyone in physics. Although he will be greatly missed  his values and spirit persist in the culture of our community."Yamamoto is survived by his wife  Kathleen Yamamoto; his former wife  Lily Yamamoto; three daughters  Cara-Jean Donaghey  Lani Yamamoto and Sharon Yamamoto; and eight grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday  Oct. 29  with a reception in the Pappalardo Room (4-349)  from approximately 2:30 to 4 p.m. Burial will be in Hawaii Memorial Park on Oahu  Hawaii.Donations may be made to the Cancer Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Graduate student Peter N. Curtin  23  passes away while running Baltimore Marathon,On Saturday  Oct. 10  MIT graduate student Peter N. Curtin passed away while running the Baltimore Marathon.Curtin  a graduate student in inorganic chemistry  was in his second year in the research group of Daniel Nocera  the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy and Professor of Chemistry  and was recently selected to receive a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.As part of a collaboration with the lab of Moungi Bawendi  the Lester Wolfe Professor in Chemistry  Curtin conducted research on sensors designed to assess the health of a tumor visually. Curtin attached chemicals to quantum dots to change the colors they emit and absorb; depending on the health of the tumor  the color of the quantum dots would change. In a collaborative effort with Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital  he was using the sensors to assess how well chemotherapy drugs were affecting a given tumor.Curtin earned his AB in Chemistry with Highest Honors from Princeton in 2008. At Princeton  Curtin played goalie for the men's club lacrosse team  was a member of the Tiger Inn eating club  and was fondly referred to by friends as Dapper. Curtin attended East Chapel Hill High School in Chapel Hill  N.C.“Peter made MIT a better place to live and do science ” said Nocera. “Here was a typical interaction between Peter and me: I would bounce an idea off of Peter  he would listen to me with thorough concentration  digest what I had to say  and then respond with something better than I could have ever imagined. All too often  we professors at MIT forget to mention to our students how special they are to us. Peter was special  he was a joy to have in my life  and I will miss him dearly. I ask the MIT community to please keep Peter’s mother  dad and family in their thoughts.”Andrew Horning  a fellow second-year graduate student in Nocera’s lab  remembers Curtin fondly. “He was a super guy ” said Horning. “Everybody loved Peter. Though he had only been here a short time  he seemed to know people everywhere in Boston. He was a brilliant chemist  but he’d never brag to anyone about it. You’d hang with him on a Friday night  and he’d be a normal guy  and on Monday morning  you’d see him in the lab and he’d know all the answers.”“This is truly a tragedy ” said Marc Kastner  dean of the School of Science. “Peter was a gifted member of the MIT community  and our thoughts are now with his family.”MIT is making counseling services available. Those who feel affected by the tragedy are encouraged to contact Mental Health Service for assistance at 617-253-2916.A memorial service for Curtin will take place at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday  Oct. 25  at the Princeton University Chapel.Peter’s family has established the Peter N. Curtin  Class of 2008  Memorial Fund in his memory to support undergraduates in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.

Theodore Pian  former AeroAstro professor  90,Theodore H.H. Pian  who taught in MIT's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics for more than 40 years and was a pioneer in the stress analysis of materials in aircraft and other stuctures  died on June 20 in Cambridge after a long illness. He was 90."To me he exemplified a professor's professor " said James Mar  professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics. "He counseled students  he did research that contributed to the  theoretical underpinnings for the massive computer programs that are routinely used for structural analysis  he created subjects for undergraduates and graduate students  he was respected by his peers and his deportment was always self-effacing."Pian was born in Shanghai  China in 1919  and earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from Tsing Hua University in Beijing. After working in the Chinese aircraft industry in the early years of World War II  he moved to the United States in 1943  and earned an SM from MIT's AeroAstro department in 1944 and a ScD in 1948.Pian quickly progressed at MIT from AeroAstro teaching assistant and research associate to become a full professor of aeronautics and astronautics in 1966. He also gave lectures at 46 universities in the United States and at 55 universities in China  Japan  India  Israel  Germany  the United Kingdom  Canada  and other countries. He retired in 1990.Always interested in foreign aerospace industry developments and his foreign students at MIT  Pian was also a visiting professor at 10 universities overseas during his career. He was an honorary professor at several leading engineering schools and aeronautical institutes in China."Ted Pian was a pioneer in the field of computational methods for structural analysis " said Paul Lagace  professor of aeronautics and astronautics  who was Pian's student before becoming one of his colleagues in the department. "His work helped lay the foundations on which many of today's operational techniques are built.Â A number of his thesis students who worked directly with him on this development work are key contributors to this field throughout the world today."Pian wrote more than 200 professional papers and wrote or edited several books in the field of finite element method  a problem-solving technique that  among other things  allows engineers to create simulations that show in great detail where a structure might bend or twist. He pioneered analytical techniques that are used for many types of mechanical calculation  such as deformation  stresses and strains  and fracture in aircraft and other mechanical structures. These methods are now used in the design  evaluation  and testing of metals and other materials to predict accurately their strength and performance. The applications of these methods range from bridges and large aircraft to precision-engineered optical  mechanical and electronic equipment.
Thomas Lyons  longtime LNS employee  70,Thomas F. Lyons  a longtime employee of the MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science (LNS)  died on Sunday  May 3  in Flagler Beach  Fla.  He was 70.Lyons started work at the LNS in 1957  at the MIT Synchrotron Lab and continued at the LNS for almost 50 years. He worked on many high-energy physics projects  most notably at MIT  Brookhaven National Laboratory  Fermilab  SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).Those who worked with him spoke of his sharp wit and political acumen and said he could solve any problem involving the design and construction of equipment. He left his mark on all the experiments he worked on -- often with some clever solution to a tough mechanical problem. In collaborating with him  there was never any distinction between physicists and engineers."Everyone at BNL  from the telephone operator to the director  knew Tom " said Richard Yamamoto  a professor of physics who started his career at MIT at the same time as Lyons. "Tom was not just an engineer for the group  but at times he negotiated important plans and policies with the technical groups at BNL. Much of his success at these negotiations had nothing to do with political skills  but just good old commonsense  which Tom was full of. He was quick at convincing someone of the right thing  without churning the waters."Preceding him in death was his son  Matthew Cory Lyons  on April 9  2009. Surviving are his wife of 35 years  Suzanne O. Lyons; two daughters  Mildred Lyons and Susan Welch; six sons  Scott Lyons  Brett Lyons  Thomas Lyons  David Lyons  Mark Fitzpatrick and Kevin Fitzpatrick; two sisters  Joan Lyons and Joyce Swanson; a brother  John Lyons; and his mother-in-law  Constance Scott.
Louis Smullin  former electrical engineering department head  93,Louis D. Smullin  former head of the electrical engineering department who helped to create MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)  died peacefully at his residence at Lasell House on Thursday  June 4. He was 93."Lou was an enormous force at MIT  one of the people who championed the values that make this place great. That kind of insight and wisdom is needed now more than ever " said Hal Abelson  the Class of 1922 Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.Born on Feb. 5  1916  Smullin received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan  Ann Arbor  in 1936  and an SM from MIT in 1939.Early in his career  Smullin made his mark at several industrial companies. From 1936 to 1938  he worked in the high voltage laboratory of the Ohio Brass Company  Barbertown  Ohio. Upon graduating from MIT in 1939  he went to the Farnsworth Television Company  Fort Wayne  Ind.  to develop the design and testing of photomultiplier tubes.In 1941  Smullin joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory as head of the Radiation Laboratory Transmit-Receive (TR) and Duplexer section. There he supervised the development of methods for testing microwave TR tubes  work which was crucial in the successful development of airborne radar used during World War II. The development saved many lives and had a positive influence on turning the tide in the war.After a stint with the Federal Telecommunications Laboratory  Smullin returned to the Institute in 1947 to organize and head the Microwave Tube Laboratory of the Research Laboratory of Electronics. He helped plan and set up MIT's Lincoln Laboratory  and in 1952 became head of the Radar and Weapons Division at Lincoln Lab. In 1955  he returned to the Cambridge campus as associate professor of electrical engineering and was made professor in 1960. He was the head of the Active Plasma Systems Group of the Research Laboratory of Electronics.Smullin was named the electrical engineering department head in 1966  serving through February 1974  when he stepped down to focus on teaching. In the 1970s and 1980s  with Smullin's help  the electrical engineering department evolved into EECS."Lou Smullin had the great foresight of building up the computer science wing of the EE department  including the appointment of the first two associate department heads  one for computer science and engineering and one for electrical science and engineering " said Institute Professor Joel Moses.An experiment for which Smullin is widely remembered occurred in 1962  soon after the first laser was invented. He and Giorgio Fiocco transmitted laser pulses to the moon for the first time  and detected their return in an experiment they called "LunaSee."Smullin retired from MIT in 1986 and as emeritus professor continued to ride his bike daily to the Institute  continuing his work on cold fusion research until suffering a stroke in 2001.He is the co-author of a book titled "Microwave Duplexers " and has published numerous technical articles and reports. Smullin was a member of the American Physical Society  the American Society of Arts and Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering  Eta Kappa Nu and Sigma Xi. He was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and the American Physical Society.Smullin is survived by his sparkling wife of 69 years  Ruth Frankel; three children  Susan Jones of Belmont  Mass.  Joseph Smullin of Swampscott  Mass.  and David Smullin  Bend  Ore.; daughters-in-law Alix Smullin and RuthAnn Smullin; Susie's partner Howard Kaplan; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. They will remember him for his gentleness  his story-telling skills  his endless persistence  and his boundless enthusiasm for science and making the world a better place.Smullin was preceded in death by son Frank Smullin and daughter-in-law Terry Bonynge.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to the Louis D.

Laszlo Tisza  physics professor emeritus  101,Laszlo Tisza  physics professor emeritus and an expert in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics  died on Wednesday  April 15. He was 101.Tisza  born in 1907 in Budapest  immigrated to the United States in 1941 and joined the MIT faculty. He taught at MIT until 1973  specializing in theoretical physics  thermodynamics  quantum mechanics and statistical physics.Tisza was a colleague of famed physicists Edward Teller  Lev Landau and Fritz London  and initiated the two-fluid theory of liquid helium. His first encounter with quantum mechanics was in 1928 when  as a mathematics student in Budapest  he transferred to the University of Gottingen and attended Max Born's course. There  he was delighted to see modern mathematics applied to experience and switched his major to physics. Still  his impression that the connection between the physics and mathematics was not clear enough became the beginning of a life-long search.Later  Tisza worked in Leipzig under Werner Heisenberg  and with Teller wrote his first paper on molecular spectra. The same theme developed into a PhD thesis  submitted in Budapest. Tisza then joined Landau's group in Kharkov and was much influenced by Landau's integration of thermodynamics into modern physics. In 1937  Tisza was associated with Fritz London in Paris  who established the connection between Bose-Einstein statistics and liquid helium. Tisza developed this into an early version of the two-fluid model of superfluidity that became standard for describing experiments.In addition to the studies he pursued at the Universities of Budapest  Gottingen and Leipzig  Tisza worked as a research associate at the Ukrainian Physico-Technical Institute in Kharkov  Ukraine  and the College de France in Paris before coming to MIT.Tisza was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  and a John Simon Guggenheim fellow. In 1966  he published "Generalized Thermodynamics."A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday  April 22  at the MIT Chapel.The MIT News Office will update this announcement as more details become available.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonApril 29  2009 (download PDF).

Kennedy's to Jimmy Carter's  according to Slate columnist Fred Kaplan SM '78  PhD '83  who was one of Kaufmann's students during his time at MIT."There is a whole generation of defense analysts who studied under Bill Kaufmann " said Kaplan. "As a thinker and a teacher  he had tremendous impact."In 1986  an article in the journal Foreign Affairs referred to Kaufmann as "the man who may well be the most knowledgeable individual in this country on the defense budgets of the past quarter-century."Having witnessed a boom in military spending during the 1960s and 1970s  he turned more circumspect in his later years. In 1986's "A Reasonable Defense " Kaufmann argued for reorganizing the U.S. military and saving billions of dollars in the process. He expanded on that theme in "Glasnost  Perestroika  and U.S. Defense Spending" (1990)  in which he laid out a plan to slash the U.S. military budget by half.In addition to his wife  Julia  Kaufmann is survived by two sisters in law  Mary Kaufmann and Betty Kaufmann  both of Darien  Conn.  and by many nieces and nephews.Services for Kaufmann will be held at a later date.

Former Dean for Student Affairs Daniel Nyhart  77,Former Dean for Student Affairs John Daniel Nyhart  who helped build community ties at MIT during a time of great unrest on American college campuses  died on Dec. 6 of pneumonia contracted as a result of Lewy Body dementia. He was 77.Nyhart  who was born in 1931 in Indianapolis  graduated in 1953 from Princeton and received an LLB in 1958 from Harvard Law School. He subsequently conducted research on the roles of banking and law in developing countries  including spending two years in Uganda and Nigeria studying development banking.Nyhart was appointed research associate in the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1960 and went on to serve the Institute for 41 years in a variety of roles. A devoted teacher  he gained great satisfaction from introducing engineering and management students to law and regulatory policy. Besides international development banking  his research interests included the intersection of law and technology  law of the sea and dispute resolution through negotiation.Characteristically  Nyhart was in on the ground floor of numerous innovations in policy processes  including the MIT Fellows in Africa Program in the early 1960s; negotiations concerning the International Law of the Sea Treaty in the 1970s; the development  use  and evaluation of computer-based models for complex negotiations through the 1970s and 1980s; and extending from that period to the end of his career  the design of processes for alternative dispute resolution  consensus building  and collaborative techniques in legal contexts.Nyhart served as dean for student affairs between 1969 and 1972 -- a challenging time in U.S. higher education as opposition to the Vietnam War culminated in a massive student strike in 1970 that shut more than 450 university  college and high school campuses across the country.As dean during this turbulent time  Nyhart devoted his attention to developing and strengthening relationships between faculty and students A profile article published in MIT's Technique yearbook in 1970 described him as "an energetic man who came [to office] with ideas of how to work with students  how to make the student experience more meaningful and how to get students and the rest of the Institute relating to each other."Among those who remembered Nyhart's contributions as dean was Bonny Kellermann '72  now MIT director of special constituencies."At a time when many college campuses were in turmoil and there was a lot of distrust between students and administration on most campuses  Dean Nyhart created a wonderful sense of community where students and administrators usually felt that they were on the same side  working for a common purpose " Kellermann said."Many of my contemporaries have fond memories of him " she added. "He attended some of our recent reunions  and very much enjoyed the interaction with my classmates (and vice versa)."In 1972  Nyhart undertook new responsibilities as special assistant to the chancellor for law-related studies and preprofessional noncurricular programs. He ultimately received tenure with appointments in the Sloan School and the Department of Ocean Engineering.Nyhart enjoyed spending summers on Mount Desert Island  Maine  and was a member of The Country Club in Brookline and the Tavern Club.Nyhart is survived by his wife of 54 years  Virginia (Nina Gibbon)  of Brookline; three devoted children and their spouses: Nicholas (Kathleen McTigue)  Lynn (Tom Broman)  and Andrew (Angie Hurlbut); and seven grandchildren.Donations in Nyhart's memory may be made to the the Lewy Body Dementia Association  P.O.

Resolution by the MIT Corporation on the death of Alex d'Arbeloff,Below is the text of a resolution passed by members of the MIT Corporation on the death of Alexander d'Arbeloff  the co-founder of high-tech company Teradyne and eighth chairman of the MIT Corporation.Resolutions of the Corporationof the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyon the death ofAlexander Vladimir d'Arbeloff1927 - 2008Alex d'Arbeloff was a force of nature. We all experienced his laser-like intellect  his wry wit  his insatiable curiosity  his amazing ability to engage  cajole  persuade  educate and enlighten those with whom he came in contact.   A personal interaction with Alex was an event not soon forgotten.  This visionary business leader and educator  this dedicated family man and loyal son of MIT  passed away on July 8 of this year. He died peacefully at the age of 80 in the company of his wife and best friend  Brit  and his children. He will be deeply missed by legions of friends and colleagues at MIT  in the Greater Boston community  and around the globe.Alexander Vladimir d'Arbeloff was born in Paris on December 21  1927 to parents who  after fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution a decade earlier  met and married in France.  In 1936  as war began to threaten Europe  the family began a nomadic existence  moving first to Argentina  then to Paraguay  and eventually to the United States  settling in New York in 1940.  English was the fourth language Alex learned to speak; but by the time he entered MIT in 1945  he had lost all trace of Russian  French  and Spanish in his speaking - he wanted to be an American  and to fit in like any other young man.In 1949  Alex earned the Bachelor of Science degree in Management. Soon after graduation  Alex found that he was not particularly well suited to the corporate culture of the 1950s  and he found it difficult to execute poor strategies when he knew he could develop better ones.   Consequently  he was fired from three jobs in his first ten years in the marketplace.In 1960  Alex and MIT classmate Nicholas DeWolf  his alphabetical neighbor in an ROTC line-up  co-founded Teradyne  Inc.  a manufacturer of electronic test equipment. They headquartered the company in downtown Boston  eschewing the Route 128 corridor in preference for a walkable commute and lower rent.Alex became Teradyne's chief executive officer in 1961  its president in 1971 and additionally its chairman in 1977  continuing as president until 1996. His precept that anyone in the organization could have an idea worthy of discussion and action fostered Teradyne's culture of collegiality  cooperation and integrity.  By the time of his retirement as chairman and CEO in 1997  the company had become the world's largest producer of automatic test equipment and interconnection systems for the electronics and telecommunications industries.Throughout his life  Alex and his gregarious and warm-hearted wife Brit  whom he married in 1962  carried out their belief in the importance of civic participation by engaging deeply in educational  medical  cultural and economic development institutions in the Greater Boston community.  Beyond their deep involvement with MIT  Alex served as chairman of the board of a number of organizations  including the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research  and Empirix  a Teradyne spin-off company.  He was a director and former chairman of the Massachusetts High Technology Council  and a director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.  He served as a trustee of the New England Conservatory  the Massachusetts General Hospital  Partners Health Care Systems  and numerous start-up companies.His honors have been many: he was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  a member of the Network Communications Hall of Fame  and the recipient of the Lifetime Contribution Award from the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers  as well as the John I. Sandson Lifetime Achievement Award from the Arthritis Foundation  and the Golden Door Award from the International Institute in Boston.   From MIT  Alex received MIT's Corporate Leadership Award  the Entrepreneurial Leadership Award from the MIT Enterprise Forum  and the Bronze Beaver Award  the highest award given by the MIT Alumni Association.MIT was exceedingly fortunate to benefit from Alex d'Arbeloff's wisdom and insight over a span of three decades.  He first became involved with the Corporation in 1980 through his membership on the visiting committee for the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He also served on the visiting committees for the Department of Economics  and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  and on the Corporation Development Committee.Alex was elected to the Corporation in 1989  became a Life Member in 1994  and in 1997 was elected Chair of the Corporation. As Chair  Alex was ex officio a member of the Executive and Investment Committees and chair of the Membership and Development Committees.Throughout his five-year chairmanship  Alex drew on his intimate knowledge of the Institute and his deep respect for the scholarly enterprise  as well as his insightful understanding of best business practices and strategic planning.   He led the Corporation during a time of challenge and growth in the Institute's finances  its campus  and in the living and learning environment for MIT's students - bringing fresh insights and leadership to all those arenas.  He brought new vitality and strength to the visiting committee system by initiating interim reports and more sharply focused agendas. His energetic participation in Institute activities across the country and around the world built new friendships and strengthened existing relationships with graduates  friends of the Institute  and industry.Throughout Alex's term as chair  his devotion to MIT was matched by his wife  Brit Jepson d'Arbeloff  an alumna of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Beyond her own service on visiting committees  the Council for the Arts  and the Development Committee  Brit has been a vibrant partner with Alex in the affairs of the Corporation.Their commitment to the Institute has been manifested through a series of exceptionally generous gifts  including the endowment of a professorship in the Department of Mechanical Engineering  support for the construction of that department's Laboratory for Information Systems  which was named in their honor  and by contributions to the construction of the Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center.Their deep dedication to the quality of teaching and learning at MIT was highlighted by the establishment in 1999 of the d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT Education - a gift that has helped catalyze new modes of instruction throughout the Institute.  In December 2007  the original TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) classroom was named in their honor to recognize this transformational gift for undergraduate education. Alex also helped the Institute develop new ways of connecting education with business practice  playing a catalytic role in the development of the Undergraduate Professional Opportunities Program and in the establishment of the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation.When he stepped down as chairman in 2003  Alex was named Honorary Chairman of the Corporation  a title he held until his death.  Following his retirement from the Corporation  Alex remained deeply engaged in the life of the Institute  teaching both in the Sloan School and the Department of Mechanical Engineering.  And even as illness eventually slowed his step  Alex maintained his keen interest in the affairs of the Institute.An extraordinary individual in the life of MIT has left us  but we will remember Alex d'Arbeloff and his remarkable leadership  deep devotion and magnificent generosity to his alma mater with profound gratitude and the deepest respect.BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED:That the Massachusetts Institute of Technology express its sorrow and its deep sense of loss on the death on the eighth day of July  2008  of its cherished colleague and extraordinary friend  honorary chairman and Life Member Emeritus Alexander Vladimir d'Arbeloff  andBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:That these resolutions be spread upon the records of the Corporation and that copies be transmitted to his wife  Brit; his daughters Katherine and Alexandra; his sons Eric and Matthew; and to other family members and friends as they may designate.ATTEST:Dana G.

A celebration of Alex d'Arbeloff,Friends of Alexander V. d'Arbeloff '49 gathered Friday afternoon to celebrate the life of the late visionary entrepreneur who co-founded Boston-based high-tech company Teradyne before becoming the eighth chairman of the MIT Corporation.Through a mix of heartfelt and humorous anecdotes  speaker after speaker at Friday's gathering in Kresge Auditorium recalled d'Arbeloff's dynamic nature  his relentless pursuit of excellence  his passion for innovation and his devotion to family and to the Institute."Alex was nuts about MIT " said Brit d'Arbeloff SM '61  his wife of 46 years. "He loved being chairman. He loved everything about it because he had the opportunity to work with a lot of smart  opinionated people and tried to convince them that his ideas were more important."Several speakers  including MIT President Susan Hockfield  spoke of the importance of the d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in Education  which Alex and Brit established in 1999 to support innovations in teaching and curriculum design at the Institute."By any measure  Alex's contributions to the Institute were distinctly non-trivial  and we continue to benefit from them today " Hockfield said. "Yet in the end ... the priceless gift that Alex gave to MIT was actually his spirit -- the intrepid  unstoppable  brilliantly creative spirit of the chronic entrepreneur."Dana Mead  who succeeded d'Arbeloff as chairman of MIT's governing body in 2003  said d'Arbeloff "relentlessly sought intellectual engagement in his life and work" while animating the experience of anyone who came in contact with him."We're all familiar with that frisson -- what one feels at the advent of a great idea or a meeting of the minds " Mead added. "Alex  as we all know  admitted no impediment to his pursuit of that spark  and he lit our imaginations along with his own."President Emeritus Charles M. Vest recalled the "boundless energy and enthusiasm" with which d'Arbeloff threw himself into his work at MIT -- qualities Vest got to know only too well during their standing weekly meetings."The mental picture of him that I retain is dominated by his slightly shy  winsome grin when something amused or delighted him " Vest said. "He cared deeply for this Institution  and together with our wonderful alumna  Brit  he left a great legacy in our minds  in our classrooms and laboratories  in our sports facilities and  above all  in our educational excellence."Earlier this month  in a resolution expressing its sorrow and deep sense of loss  the MIT Corporation praised d'Arbeloff as a "force of nature" who brought "remarkable leadership  deep devotion and magnificent generosity" to MIT."We all experienced his laser-like intellect  his wry wit  his insatiable curiosity  his amazing ability to engage  cajole  persuade  educate and enlighten those with whom he came in contact " the resolution stated.Other speakers at Friday's celebration were: William C. Morris '60  chairman of J. & W. Seligman & Company  Inc.; Diana Henderson  professor of literature and dean for curricula and faculty support; Gregory Mark '03  SM '05  founder of Aeromotion; Richard Dyck  president of TCS-Japan and East Asia Connector Services  Inc.; Barrie Zesiger HM '07  founding partners and managing director of Zesiger Capital Group LLC and a member of the MIT Corporation; and Gururaj "Desh" Deshpande HM '07  founder and chairman of Sycamore Networks and a member of the MIT Corporation.While the list of speakers was limited to 10  tributes have poured forth from scores of MIT community members who knew d'Arbeloff."Alex was always asking why we did things this way or that  or -- more often -- simply pronouncing that there was a better way " said former Vice President and Secretary of the Corporation Kathryn Willmore. "But just because he saw the world differently from many  perhaps most  of us in the university  this in no way lessened his devotion to this place. He was fiercely interested in everything and everyone he met  and once he took on a challenge  that was it. He certainly took on MIT -- to our great benefit."An encounter with Alex wasn't always comfortable  but it was often fun  and it was always worthwhile " she added.Mary Boyce  head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering  said d'Arbeloff "was a source of wisdom  inspiration and guidance" to the Institute and to her department  where he taught as a professor of the practice after he stepped down as chairman in 2003."His connection with faculty and students at MIT was truly genuine and personal because his story was and is the MIT story -- always thinking of or challenging that new discovery  that next innovation  that next new technology and then working to make it happen " she said. "Alex d'Arbeloff will be missed.Richard Schmalensee  the John C Head III Dean  Emeritus  of the MIT Sloan School of Management  said d'Arbeloff "was a source of wise counsel to me as dean" who "pushed all of us to be serious about advancing management education.An archived video of the celebration is availablehere.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonOctober 22  2008 (download PDF).

Kenneth Hoffman  former math department head  77,Former Department of Mathematics Head Kenneth Hoffman  who spent more than 40 years on MIT's faculty and made significant contributions to U.S. education and science policy  died Sept. 29 following a heart attack. He was 77.Hoffman  who led the math department from 1971 to 1979  was instrumental in addressing mathematics in U.S. public policy. After stepping down as head of the mathematics department  he moved to Washington  where he directed the David Committee on federal support of mathematical research from 1981 to 1984. He established and ran the math community's first Washington Office of Governmental and Public Affairs from 1984 to 1989. During that time  media coverage of mathematics increased dramatically  according to the American Mathematical Society.Born in Long Beach  Calif.  Hoffman earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Occidental College in 1952. He later received an MA and PhD in mathematics from UCLA.Hoffman joined the MIT Department of Mathematics as an instructor in 1956. He became a full professor in 1964  and served as chair of the Pure Mathematics Committee from 1968 to 1969. From 1969 to 1971  he directed the Commission on MIT Education  appointed by MIT President Howard Johnson to conduct a comprehensive review of education  research and governance at MIT. He retired in 1996.Hoffman's area of research specialization was functional analysis. Along with Richard Arens and Isadore Singer  he made fundamental contributions to both complex and abstract analysis. Among them was a paper (with Singer) that answered many of the questions on commutative Banach algebras raised by I. M. Gelfand.In 1986  the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics awarded Hoffman its first Public Service Award "for his farsighted and effective initiation of the planning and the implementation of a national mathematical science policy."In 1990  Hoffman also received the first Award for Distinguished Public Service of the American Mathematical Society. Its citation reads in part  "Through his efforts  the awareness of the importance of mathematics and the support of mathematical research has been significantly heightened in the general public  among makers of science policy in the government  and among university administrators."Hoffman was also a leader in national K-12 education. At the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council he launched a series of initiatives with national impact. These included creation of both the Mathematical Sciences Education Board and the National Science Education Standards project.In 1961  Hoffman wrote an undergraduate linear algebra textbook  co-authored with Ray Kunze  that was used for many decades and became a classic in the field.He is survived by his wife  Alicia Hoffman; former wife Patti Hoffman; a son  Robert Hoffman; two daughters  Laura Lasa and Donna Ullah; a sister  Barbara Hollis; and 14 grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at the Curran-Bromwell Funeral Home in Cambridge  Md.  on Friday  Oct. 3.

MIT professor Lucian W. Pye  leading China scholar  dies at 86,Retired MIT political science professor Lucian W. Pye  one of America's leading China scholars  died Sept. 5 in Boston after a long illness. He was 86.ÂPye  Ford Professor of Political Science Emeritus at MIT  was a leader in studying the politics of modernization in the Third World. He was author or editor of more than 25 books including "Asian Power and Politics: The Cultural Dimensions of Authority " "China: An Introduction" and "Mao-Tse Tung."He served as a mentor to several generations of influential political scientists and as an active public intellectual and policy adviser to presidential candidates  including John F. Kennedy. In addition to serving as president of the American Political Science Association from 1988-89  Pye participated in a variety of private organizations where scholars  government experts and lay leaders met to discuss Asia-related research and policy. These included the Council on Foreign Relations  the U.S.-China Relations Committee and the Asian Foundation.Â"Lucian was a giant in the intellectual world that went well beyond our field of political science " said Charles Stewart  head of MIT's Department of Political Science. "For anyone ever called 'hero' or 'scholar' by Lucian  we must now live up to those titles he so cheerfully bestowed upon us."ÂHis dominant intellectual concern was to explore the cultural differences that help explain why the game of politics differs so greatly from one nation to another. Widely regarded as one of the foremost contemporary practitioners and proponents of the concept of political culture  Pye attempted to penetrate beneath the surface of political life to the deeper layers of attitude  value and sentiment that motivate political behavior.ÂThe unique understanding that he brought to his studies of China  in particular  came in part out of his experience of growing up as a child of Congregational missionaries in Shansi Province  in northwest China. Born in 1921  he lived primarily in China until he went to Minnesota to attend Carleton College. There  Pye met fellow student Mary Toombs Waddill of Greenville  S.C.  whom he married in 1945. She would become his partner in both life and work for the next 63 years  often traveling with him throughout Asia and helping edit his books.ÂAfter graduating from Carleton  Pye returned to China at the end of World War II to serve as an intelligence officer in the 5th Marine Corps  achieving the rank of Second Lieutenant. He returned to the U.S. to attend graduate school on the GI Bill at Yale University. During these crucial years of Pye's intellectual formation  he was a part of a significant contingent of political scientists including Harold Lasswell  Nathan Leites and Gabriel Almond.Â Together  the group explored the psychological  sociological and anthropological elements of international affairs -- a departure from the standard "realism" of the day. Almond  his mentor at Yale  recalled his student Pye as "generally leaving me a little breathless; he had so much energy and enthusiasm."ÂPye himself became an important mentor and teacher to scores of political scientists since his arrival at MIT in 1956  where he helped found the Department of Political Science. With his encouragement and oversight  many of his students have gone on to prominent positions in both academia and government.His studies of the politics of modernization in the Third World made theoretical and empirical contributions to our understanding of the development process and his participation in many social science and advising organizations were broadly influential.Â As one of a handful of scholars who studied Asian politics from a comparative standpoint  he wasÂ listened to in the policy world as well as the classroom.He is survived by his wife  Mary  of Lexington  Mass.  and his three children  Lyndy and Chris  both of Northampton  Mass.  and Virginia  of Richmond  Va.  as well as three grandchildren  Anna Swann-Pye and Eva and Daniel Ravenal. Memorial services will be held both in the town of Belmont  Mass.  and at MIT at a future time.In lieu of flowers  gifts may be directed to the Lucian Pye Graduate Fellowship Fund at MIT  c/o Bonny Kellermann  MIT Memorial Gifts  W98-500  600 Memorial Drive  Cambridge  MA 02139.Â  For more information about the fund or how to make a gift  contact Bonny Kellermann at 617-253-9722 orbonnyk@mit.edu.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonSeptember 17  2008 (download PDF).

I guess I was more interested in golf than I was in a laboratory " Chittick told the News Office in 2001.Aseries of photoshas been assembled by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
Alex d'Arbeloff  former MIT Corporation chairman  dies at 80,Alexander Vladimir d'Arbeloff '49  a visionary entrepreneur who co-founded Boston-based high-tech company Teradyne before becoming the eighth chairman of the MIT Corporation  died peacefully on Tuesday  July 8  surrounded by family. He was 80.As chairman of the MIT Corporation  d'Arbeloff provided crucial leadership for the Calculated Risks  Creative Revolutions fundraising campaign  which had a transformative effect on the Institute--from the physical campus to its research agenda. The campaign ushered in cutting-edge facilities such as the Al and Barrie Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center and the Ray and Maria Stata Center and also sparked a new emphasis on the intersection between the life sciences and engineering at MIT.With his wife  Brit SM '61  d'Arbeloff created the Fund for Excellence in MIT Education to support teaching innovations in science and engineering. The pair also supported a professorship in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering and established the d'Arbeloff Lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering."All of us privileged to know Alex are deeply saddened by his loss " said MIT President Susan Hockfield. "MIT has lost an extraordinary friend who paired his passionate devotion to the Institute with a brilliantly dispassionate  clear-eyed view of how it could grow even stronger. Through the d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in MIT Education  among many other gifts  Alex and Brit tapped a deep vein of creativity that has transformed MIT. We will sorely miss his warmth  charm  humor and remarkable gift for framing complex problems and inspiring visionary solutions."D'Arbeloff was born in 1927 in Paris to parents who had fled the Russian Revolution a decade earlier  and his family led a nomadic existence during his adolescence. As the clouds of war gathered in Europe  the d'Arbeloffs moved to South America in 1936  to New York two years later and to Los Angeles the following year  before returning to New York in 1940.After graduating from MIT with a bachelor's in management  d'Arbeloff found that his can-do attitude didn't always sit well with superiors. In later years he was proud to note that he was fired from three jobs during a 10-year period  and that while serving in the U.S. Army reserves  his commanding officer berated him for having "antagonized every officer" at their post."I didn't feel I had " d'Arbeloff told an interviewer in 1997  recalling the episode. "I didn't do it on purpose. I just wanted to do more than they were willing to do."In 1960  d'Arbeloff co-founded Teradyne Inc. with Nick DeWolf--a former MIT classmate whom he had met when they had to line up alphabetically during an ROTC class. During his tenure as president and CEO of Teradyne  which manufactures automatic test equipment and interconnection systems for the electronics and telecommunications industries  the company's annual sales rose from $13 million to more than $1 billion.In 1997  he was named chairman of the MIT Corporation  having served as a member since 1989. At the time  he said he was aware of the differences between academia and the business world but preferred to focus on the common ground they shared."You begin  in both cases  with talented people. Then you have to develop an effective organization and instill a sense of mission. You have to strive to win. And  ultimately  you have to provide something of value to society " he said."MIT is a great institution  with great impact on the nation and the world. I am truly honored to have been given this opportunity to serve as MIT's chairman and to contribute to an institution of this level of excellence  this magnitude  and one that has such an impact on society."D'Arbeloff became honorary chairman of the Corporation after stepping down as chairman in 2003. As a professor of the practice  he taught at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. D'Arbeloff also served on the board of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.Friends and colleagues recalled his humor  his thoughtfulness  his dedication to his family and his devotion to MIT.President Emeritus Charles M. Vest characterized d'Arbeloff as a dynamic personality who constantly strove for improvement and who possessed "one of the most active minds" he had ever seen."As chairman of the MIT Corporation  Alex properly and productively challenged the ways in which academia functions. His rethinking of MIT's budgeting processes was invaluable " Vest said. "He radiated energy  loved to challenge ideas  and was as at home in a classroom as in his board room. He left a great legacy in Boston and MIT."Paul Gray  president emeritus and professor of electrical engineering and computer science  emeritus  recalled how d'Arbeloff spoke about the importance of the years that followed his graduation from MIT."When we first met he told me about his early post-MIT career experiences which included several tough reviews and dismissals. These led to his decision--brilliant in hindsight--to start his own company  which has been a genuine success  validating his management style " Gray said."He has always been  in my experience  a person who 'thought otherwise'--who brought different perspectives  fresh insights and creative solutions to problems  here at MIT and elsewhere " continued Gray  who preceded d'Arbeloff as chairman of the Corporation. "His leadership of the Corporation and the creative philanthropy that he and Brit demonstrated and engendered in others will bring lasting benefit to this special place."D'Arbeloff was the recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and a director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. He also served on the boards of several corporations and on the board of the Whitehead Institute  which he chaired from 2004 to 2006.He is survived by his wife  Brit; daughters  Katherine and Alexandra; sons  Eric and Matthew; and six grandchildren.Funeral services and burial will be private. The family has said that in lieu of flowers  gifts may be made to MIT for the d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in Education.

Robert I. Hulsizer Jr.  physics professor emeritus  88,Professor of Physics Emeritus Robert I. Hulsizer Jr. PhD '48  a former chairman of the faculty and expert on elementary particle physics whose zeal for teaching science made him a student favorite at MIT  died on April 30 of complications from Alzheimer's. He was 88.ÂBorn in East Orange  N.J.  in November 1919  Hulsizer received his BS in math from Bates College in 1940  an MA in physics from Wesleyan University in 1942 and his PhD in physics from MIT.ÂDuring World War II  Hulsizer helped develop radar at the Radiation Lab at MIT.Â Among the applications he worked on were radar-guided bombsights that allowed bombers to find their targets through cloud cover  which was an important advance for wartime pilots who previously relied on visual sighting.ÂÂIn 1964  after spending 15 years at the University of Illinois  he returned to take a professorship at MIT and to direct what became the Education Research Center  which was focused on new ways of teaching science and integrating the humanities and social sciences.ÂÂA tremendously popular and inspiring professor  Hulsizer saw teaching as an essential part of being a scientist.Â For many years  he taught the 8.01 and 8.02 elementary physics courses required of all MIT students  where he created many lively  vivid lectures and demonstrations that brought the subject to life.ÂRay Magliozzi '72  better known as half of Click and Clack from the National Public Radio series Car Talk  said Hulsizer was one of his favorite professors at MIT."I only took one course with him but he made a tremendous impression on me--he had a very gentle  nonimposing way of conveying complex concepts " Magliozzi told the MIT News Office. "I would say he gave me the confidence to tackle a few courses that I probably should have flunked."ÂHulsizer's talent as a teacher sprung from his insights  deep empathy and his conviction that complex ideas can be made understandable to anyone. One student evaluation from his class read  "We â€¦ wanted to learn because of his zeal and absolute enthusiasm for the subject.Â To learn from a man like him makes me feel really special. He is considerate  kind  highly intelligent and can relate to students even though he is decades older."ÂHulsizer and his wife were housemasters of Ashdown House  a graduate dormitory  from 1974-85. The pair hosted a popular weekly evening of ice cream and socializing.Â When they stepped down as housemasters  the space where it was held was renamed the Hulsizer room.ÂHulsizer retired in 1986 after 22 years as a professor at MIT  and continued teaching at the Institute for many years after. In Chilmark  Mass.  where he had a second home  he served as chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals and of the Town Affairs Committee.ÂHe was a fellow of the American Physics Society and a member of Sigma Xi  Phi Beta Kappa  the American Association of University Professors and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Hulsizer also served as the chairman of the MIT faculty from 1977-79.ÂHulsizer's memory began to fail him several years ago.Â He gave up teaching when he could no longer recall scientific formulae fast enough to stay ahead of his students.Â He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia  an Alzheimer's-like disease.ÂHe is survived by his wife of 41 years  Carol Kasen Hulsizer.Â His marriage to Bernice L. Hulsizer ended in divorce in 1965. He is survived by his children from his first marriage: Stephen Hulsizer and wife  Elsie  of Seattle; Ann Wymore of Jemez Springs  N.M.; Morgan Jenkins and husband  Bill Jenkins  of Fredericksburg  Va.; and Cynthia Hulsizer and husband  Bob Bernahl  of Philo  Ill.Â He is also survived by his stepchildren  Elizabeth Ascher and husband  Michael Yogman  of Cambridge  Mass.; Ellen Ascher of San Diego; and Steven Ascher and wife  Jeanne Jordan  of Newton  Mass; and grandchildren Adam Wymore  Sara and Robin Jenkins  Madeline and Alexandra Yogman  Jordan Ascher and Ana Maria Ascher.ÂA memorial service will take place July 19 in Chilmark and at MIT in the fall (date to be announced).A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonMay 14  2008 (download PDF).

Edward Lorenz  father of chaos theory and butterfly effect  dies at 90,Edward Lorenz  an MIT meteorologist who tried to explain why it is so hard to make good weather forecasts and wound up unleashing a scientific revolution called chaos theory  died April 16 of cancer at his home in Cambridge. He was 90.A professor at MIT  Lorenz was the first to recognize what is now called chaotic behavior in the mathematical modeling of weather systems. In the early 1960s  Lorenz realized that small differences in a dynamic system such as the atmosphere--or a model of the atmosphere--could trigger vast and often unsuspected results.These observations ultimately led him to formulate what became known as the butterfly effect--a term that grew out of an academic paper he presented in 1972 entitled: "Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"Lorenz's early insights marked the beginning of a new field of study that impacted not just the field of mathematics but virtually every branch of science--biological  physical and social. In meteorology  it led to the conclusion that it may be fundamentally impossible to predict weather beyond two or three weeks with a reasonable degree of accuracy.Some scientists have since asserted that the 20th century will be remembered for three scientific revolutions--relativity  quantum mechanics and chaos."By showing that certain deterministic systems have formal predictability limits  Ed put the last nail in the coffin of the Cartesian universe and fomented what some have called the third scientific revolution of the 20th century  following on the heels of relativity and quantum physics " said Kerry Emanuel professor of atmospheric scienceÂ at MIT. "He was also a perfect gentleman  and through his intelligence  integrity and humility set a very high standard for his and succeeding generations."ÂBorn in 1917 in West Hartford  Conn.  Lorenz received an AB in mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1938  an AM in mathematics from Harvard University in 1940  an SM in meteorology from MIT in 1943 and an ScD in meteorology from MIT in 1948. It was while serving as a weather forecaster for the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II that he decided to do graduate work in meteorology at MIT."As a boy I was always interested in doing things with numbers  and was also fascinated by changes in the weather " Lorenz wrote in an autobiographical sketch.Lorenz was a member of the staff of what was then MIT's Department of Meteorology from 1948 to 1955  when he was appointed to the faculty as an assistant professor. He was promoted to professor in 1962 and was head of the department from 1977 to 1981. He became an emeritus professor in 1987.Lorenz  who was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975  won numerous awards  honors and honorary degrees. In 1983  he and former MIT Professor Henry M. Stommel were jointly awarded the $50 000 Crafoord Prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  a prize established to recognize fields not eligible for Nobel Prizes.In 1991  he was awarded the Kyoto Prize for basic sciences in the field of earth and planetary sciences. Lorenz was cited by the Kyoto Prize committee for establishing "the theoretical basis of weather and climate predictability  as well as the basis for computer-aided atmospheric physics and meteorology." The committee added that Lorenz "made his boldest scientific achievement in discovering 'deterministic chaos ' a principle which has profoundly influenced a wide range of basic sciences and brought about one of the most dramatic changes in mankind's view of nature since Sir Isaac Newton."During leaves of absence from MIT  he held research or teaching positions at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff  Ariz.; the Department of Meteorology at the University of California at Los Angeles; the Det Norske Meteorologiske Insitutt in Oslo  Norway; and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder  Colo.An avid hiker and cross-country skier  Lorenz was active up until about  two weeks before his death  his family said.Lorenz is survived by three children  Nancy  Edward and Cheryl  and four grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday  April 20  at the  Swedenborg Chapel 
50 Quincy St.  Cambridge. The MIT News Office  will update this announcement as more

William L. Kraushaar  high-energy astronomy pioneer  87,Professor William L. Kraushaar  a former MIT physics professor and a pioneer in the field of high-energy astronomy  died March 21 of complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 87.Kraushaar received his bachelor degree from Lafayette College in 1942. During World War II he worked at the National Bureau of Standards on projects that included development of the proximity fuse for artillery shells. After the war he earned his doctorate at Cornell University. In 1949 he was appointed research associate at MIT where he made the first measurements of the mean life of the pi meson at the MIT electron synchrotron. Over the next 15 years he rose through the faculty ranks  becoming a full professor before leaving MIT for the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1965.In 1957 Kraushaar began a decade-long effort to map the sky in the "light" of cosmic gamma rays. Their detection promised to open new ways to investigate high-energy processes in the universe. Initial balloon-borne experiments failed due to background gamma rays generated in the residual atmosphere above the highest attainable altitudes.In 1958  Kraushaar seized the new opportunity for experiments above the atmosphere. Working with Professor George Clark  he directed the development in the MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science of a gamma-ray detector for a satellite experiment that was launched in April 1961 as Explorer 11. It registered 31 events with the electronic signatures of cosmic gamma rays with energies greater than 50 MeV. Kraushaar then initiated a second and more refined experiment to be carried on OSO 3. In this project Kraushaar and Clark were joined by Gordon Garmire  a former student of Kraushaar. The OSO 3 experiment  launched in March of 1967  registered 621 cosmic gamma ray events. It yielded the first all-sky map of high-energy cosmic gamma rays showing a concentration of gamma rays from directions in the Milky Way where gamma-ray producing interactions of charged cosmic rays with interstellar matter are most abundant. It also demonstrated the existence of extra-galactic gamma ray sources that have since been identified as giant black holes at the centers of distant galaxies. The OSO 3 experiment opened the field of high-energy gamma-ray astronomy  which has become one of the most active areas of space research.Upon his move to Wisconsin  Kraushaar established a research group in the new area of X-ray astronomy. Using instruments flown on "sounding" rockets  he and his colleagues produced the first all-sky map of low-energy X rays that revealed the spatial distribution of million-degree interstellar gas. They extended these results in several satellite experiments. Kraushaar was appointed the Max Mason Professor of Physics in 1980.Kraushaar was a fellow of the American Physical Society  and a member of the American Astronomical Society  the International Astronomical Union  the National Academy of Sciences  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships and the Senior Scientist Award of the Humboldt Foundation. He served on numerous advisory committees of the National Academy of Sciences and NASA. He co-authored with Professor Uno Ingard a college text  "Introduction to Mechanics  Matter  and Waves."After his retirement  Kraushaar moved to Maine where he resided in Scarborough with summers at his cabin in Denmark  Maine. He is survived by his wife  the former Elizabeth Rodgers  and by three children from his first marriage.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonApril 2  2008 (download PDF).

Joseph Weizenbaum  professor emeritus of computer science  85,Joseph Weizenbaum  a professor emeritus of computer science at MIT who grew skeptical of artificial intelligence after creating a program that made many users feel like they were speaking with an empathic psychologist  died March 5 in Berlin. He was 85.Weizenbaum  who was Jewish  fled Nazi Germany with his parents and arrived in the United States in the mid-1930s. At the beginning of his career with computers  in the early 1950s  he worked on analog computers; later  he helped design and build a digital computer at Wayne University in Detroit.In 1955  Weizenbaum became a member of the General Electric team that designed and built the first computer system dedicated to banking operations. Among his early technical contributions were the list processing system SLIP and the natural language understanding program ELIZA  which was an important development in artificial intelligence and cemented his role in the folklore of computer science research.Named for the heroine of "My Fair Lady " ELIZA was perhaps the first instance of what today is known as a chatterbot program. Specifically  the ELIZA program simulated a conversation between a patient and a psychotherapist by using a person's responses to shape the computer's replies. Weizenbaum was shocked to discover that many users were taking his program seriously and were opening their hearts to it. The experience prompted him to think philosophically about the implications of artificial intelligence  and  later  to become a critic of it.In 1976  he authored "Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation " in which he displayed ambivalence toward computer technology and warned against giving machines the responsibility for making genuinely human choices. Specifically  Weizenbaum argued that it was not just wrong but dangerous and  in some cases  immoral to assume that computers would be able to do anything given enough processing power and clever programming."No other organism  and certainly no computer  can be made to confront genuine human problems in human terms " he wrote."'Computer Power and Human Reason' raised questions about the role of artificial intelligence  and spurred debate about the role of computer systems in decision making for many years " said Eric Grimson  head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.Weizenbaum's initial wariness about computers -- and humanity's reliance on them -- later evolved into a deep resentment. By the early 1980s  he was railing against the concept of computer illiteracy  saying it was a form of "mass hysteria" drummed up by computer manufacturers as a way to sell more product. The real focus  he said  should not be on computer literacy but literacy itself.In a 1985 interview with New Age journal  he proudly described himself as a heretic of technology."The dependence on computers is merely the most recent -- and the most extreme --Â example of how man relies on technology in order to escape the burden of acting as an independent agent " Weizenbaum told the journal. "It helps him avoid the task of giving meaning to his life  of deciding and pursuing what is truly valuable."Weizenbaum joined MIT in 1963 as a visiting associate professor of computer science. Within four years  he had been awarded tenure in the Department of Electrical Engineering. He later held academic appointments at Harvard University  at the Harvard Graduate School of Education  Stanford University  the Technical University of Berlin and the University of Hamburg in Germany. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  a member of the New York Academy of Science and of the European Academy of Science.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonMarch 12  2008 (download PDF).

Professor Emeritus J. Francis Reintjes dies at 96,MIT Professor Emeritus J. Francis Reintjes  celebrated for his keen wit and unassuming but steadfast leadership in electrical engineering and computer science  passed away Feb. 21 after a brief illness. He was 96.He was born in Troy  N.Y.  on Feb. 19  1912  the son of George and Katherine (Lynch) Reintjes. Reintjes was a graduate of LaSalle Institute in Troy  N.Y.  and received bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy  N.Y.During his career as an electrical engineer  educator and researcher  his work touched many of the technological advances of the 20th century. He began his career as an engineer with General Motors in Lockport  N.Y.  and subsequently taught electrical engineering at Manhattan College in New York City.Reintjes playfully described himself in a 2006 interview for the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems as "the man who came to dinnerand never left." The dinner was a gathering in Boston of the Institute for Radio Engineers at which he met and was later invited by W.L. Barrow to become involved in the new radar school at MIT--ultimately joining the Institute in 1943. He would remain in academia  earning a faculty appointment at MIT in 1947.Over his 65-year association with MIT  Reintjes' research interests expanded from the areas of radar and electronics  and early information storage and retrieval  to applications of computer-communications technologies. After five years working as a research staff member in the Research Lab of Electronics  Reintjes was appointed as the director of the Servo Lab  where he remained for 21 years.As the Servo Lab grew under Reintjes' leadership  the emphasis focused increasingly on computerization of numerical control. Using the Whirlwind I computer  Reintjes and colleague Douglas T. Ross MS '54 developed an automatic programming system for numerical control in two dimensions  collectively known as Automatically Programmed Tools (APT).Although he referred to the early Servo Lab as a kind of "military job shop " Reintjes was well aware of the need to build its theoretical and academic side. With added faculty through the 1950s  the lab  renamed the Electronic Systems Laboratory (ESL) in 1959  became a haven for not only master's but also for doctoral studies. Annual reports in the 1960s gave testament. Thesis research averaged 47 per year--not only in electrical engineering  but spilling into chemical and mechanical engineering  physics  mathematics  biology  nutrition and food science and aeronautical and astronautical engineering. ESL continued to prosper  ultimately taking on its current  independent lab status and from 1978 on became the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).Reintjes  in a sense  also launched the first "search engine" system  using general-purpose computers to locate research in professional literature through Project INTREX.Reintjes' interest in pairing academia with industry throughout his career eventually paved the way for him to take on the directorship in 1960 of the MIT VI-A Cooperative (Internship) Program in Electrical Engineering. He opened up the program by putting admission to the VI-A MS degree on the same academic requirements scale as admission throughout the EE Department and spread the scope of administrative involvement across the department by assigning faculty members to take charge of the cooperative relationships with each of the companies  a practice still followed by VI-A today.Retirement in 1978 did not hold Frank Reintjes back from remaining an involved presence in the EECS Department and LIDS. He returned weekly  attending events and meetings and often serving as the best source for historical information. As described in the May 2006 edition of LIDS|ALL  Reintjes is "friendly  funny and inspiring ... and his legacy won't be forgotten."Frank Reintjes is survived by two sons  William F. Reintjes and his wife  Ann Marie  of Annandale  Va.  and John F. Reintjes and his wife  Maura  of Alexandria  Va.; a daughter  Ellen E. Reintjes and her husband  Don Tatzin  of Lafayette  Calif.; a grandson; a sister  Marion R. Baker of Troy  N.Y.; and several nieces and nephews. His wife of 64 years  Elizabeth A. Walsh  passed away on May 19  2007.Funeral services will be held privately. For those who wish  in lieu of flowers  contributions in Mr. Reintjes' memory may be made to MIT for the J.

He was 89.Buchanan devoted his life and dedicated service to MIT and to his profession. He joined the MIT faculty in 1953 as professor of biology and as director of the newly established Division of Biochemistry. He soon recruited a core group of young and senior faculty to the department  including Gene Brown  Vernon Ingram  Salvador Luria  Paul Schimmel  Phil Robbins and Lisa Steiner. Growing from this nucleus  the Biology Department and the Biochemistry Division soon gained a reputation for being among the outstanding programs in the country.Buchanan helped attract other leading scientists to MIT  including Cyrus Levinthal  Maurice Fox and Alexander Rich--key appointments that helped boost the biology department's international reputation.In his autobiography  the late MIT President James Killian observed that bringing Buchanan to MIT was among the most important recruitments of his tenure.Buchanan completed his undergraduate degree in chemistry at DePauw University in 1938 and earned a master's in biological chemistry at the University of Michigan in 1939. He moved to Harvard Medical School for his Ph.D. work under A. Baird Hastings  where his research contributed to understanding the gluconeogenic pathway from lactic acid. This was one of the pioneering studies on biosynthetic pathways using isotopically labeled precursors  in this case  the extremely short half-life form of carbon  11C.After completing his Ph.D. in 1943  he joined the faculty in physiological chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School  rising to full professor by the time he left for MIT in 1953. Buchanan was awarded a Medical Research Council Fellowship between 1946 and 1948  which he used to work with Hugo Theorell at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. This was a singularly successful period in Buchanan's career  in which he gained expertise in protein and enzyme chemistry. He also met Elsa Nilsson  who would in due time become Elsa Buchanan  his wife and inseparable companion of 58 years.Buchanan was honored in 1966 as the first John and Dorothy Wilson Professor at MIT  a chair now held by Dianne Newman of the biology department.

Herb Pomeroy  founder of MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble  dies,Jazz icon Herb Pomeroy  who founded the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble in 1963  died August 11 at his home in Gloucester. He was 77.Pomeroy  a trumpeter inspired by Louis Armstrong  played with such jazz greats as Charlie Parker  Stan Kenton and Lionel Hampton. When he first came to MIT  he found a jazz ensemble so bad that he called their performance "horrible." He considered telling them he couldn't continue  but instead told the musicians  "Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work."That work continued for 22 years  until 1985  and under Pomeroy's guidance  the Festival Jazz Ensemble (FJE) was transformed into a top-notch  award-winning group that gained wide recognition through their concerts and festival appearances. The FJE has performed throughout the United States; it was also the first college ensemble to appear at Switzerland's prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival."Herb was the real architect of the jazz program at MIT. In the early going of our music program  jazz was one of our flagship activities  even before classical music. Herb was unusual in that he was a wonderful jazz player who liked to and could teach " said composer and Institute Professor John Harbison of MIT's music section."This is an unfathomable loss to jazz at MIT and the jazz world in general " said Frederick Harris  Jr.  the current director of MIT's wind ensembles. "Herb was one of my most important mentors  and what is so amazing is that there are literally thousands of musicians who can say the same thing. His reach was incredible. He was a rare and special man who was not only a first-class musician but also a first-class human being."Pomeroy regularly returned to MIT as a guest artist from 2000-2005. According to Harris  he continually "gave so much of himself to our students and to our faculty."Music and Theater Arts Lecturer Mark Harvey recalled  "It was a signal honor for me to have Herb perform as a featured soloist in my wind ensemble piece 'Beyond ' commemorating Duke Ellington. Herb had played with the Duke and taught a legendary course on Ellington's music at Berklee. Herb brought to this performance  to our students  and to all of his years at MIT  something of the Ellingtonian model of generosity  warmth and superb musicianship. We will all miss him greatly."In 2005  when Pomeroy returned to MIT for a concert saluting his 75th birthday  the performance featured alumni conductors and musicians."Herb taught us more than music " said Dave Ricks (S.B. '83; S.M. '83; Ph.D. '94 Ocean Engineering)  a member of the ensemble from 1978-1983 and 1987-1994. "He helped me refine the way I deal with people. He's a master of making things better by bringing out the best in people. Whenever I get confused about what other people are  and what other people are for  I remember how Herb worked with us  and I just focus on treating other people well."Visiting hours will be held on Wednesday  Aug. 15 in the Pike-Grondin Funeral Home  61 Middle Street  Gloucester from 4 to 8 p.m. Relatives and friends are invited to attend.A celebration of Pomeroy's life and music will be held Sunday  Sept. 9  at Emmanuel Church  15 Newbury St.  Boston  at 3 p.m.The MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble will conduct a memorial concert on Saturday  May 10 in Kresge Auditorium.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonSeptember 19  2007 (download PDF).

Eugene Bell  'father of tissue engineering ' dies at 88,Eugene Bell  a former MIT biology professor renowned for his pioneering work in the field of regenerative medicine  passed away on June 22. He was 88.A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel on Nov. 19 at 12 noon.Bell recently donated more than $1 million to MIT to establish the Eugene Bell Career Development Professorship of Tissue Engineering. Darrell J. Irvine  the inaugural holder of the professorship  said Bell came to be known as the "father of tissue engineering" as a result of a seminal study he published in the journal Science in 1981.That study  which has been cited more than 400 times  demonstrated a way to repair skin wounds with artificial skin made from a person's or an animal's own cells."This basic demonstration became the basis for an entire generation of studies aimed at regenerating every type of tissue -- skin  cartilage  bone  nerve  liver  etc. " Irvine said. "It turns out that many tissues require different approaches and provide unique challenges  but the basic work done by Bell paved the way for what is now referred to as 'regenerative medicine.'"Irvine noted that some of these attempts - based on strategies similar to Bell's - became commercial products. For example  certain commercial synthetic skin grafts are based on concepts similar to Bell's original design  he said.Bell was born in New York and enlisted in the Army during World War Two. He saw combat action in the Philippines and in New Guinea and was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that stayed in his hand for the rest of his life.He began his academic career at MIT in 1956 and became a professor of biology in 1967. While at MIT he laid the groundwork for the field of tissue engineering. Bell held more than 40 US and foreign patents and was the chief author of more than 200 scientific papers.Bell retired from MIT in 1986  but went on to found two companies that made the technology he helped develop commercially available.His wife  Millicent  said Bell never lost sight of his youthful ambition to make a positive contribution to the world."As a youth he was always someone wanting the world to be a good place. As one grows older sometimes one puts such thoughts aside - but he never did " she said in an interview.In addition to his wife  Bell leaves a son  a daughter  and four grandchildren.A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. Aug. 19 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. A separate memorial service on the MIT campus is being planned; details will be released as they become available.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonSeptember 19  2007 (download PDF).

O'Connor  Draper Laboratory's retired vice president of human resources and administration (1981-1994) and secretary of the corporation (1994-2005)  died June 11 of cancer at the age of 77.For more than a dozen years  O'Connor was the face of Draper Laboratory in the Cambridge community. O'Connor presented Draper's viewpoint on topics of public interest  such as the Nuclear-free Cambridge Referendum of 1983  and he provided leadership for many civic organizations.Draper Laboratory President James Shields said  "Joe O'Connor was a great champion of collaboration between the laboratory and the Cambridge community. He always saw the two as intertwined  and he cultivated a mutually beneficial relationship  notably through the intersection of the educational aspect of the laboratory's charter and opportunities to work with the Cambridge Public Schools. Just as Joe had foreseen  Draper employees have enjoyed working with the students and faculty."O'Connor was a past president of the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce and vice president of its business education committee. For the Rotary Club of Cambridge  O'Connor performed the roles of president  director and vice president  as well as chairman of its vocational service committee. O'Connor also served Cambridgeport Savings Bank as a corporator and director  and later its parent company  Port Financial  as a director. He was a director for Junior Achievement of Eastern Mass. and a corporator of Mount Auburn Hospital.For his service to the community  O'Connor was recognized by the Cambridge City Council and Mayor Sheila Russell in 1997.Born June 15  1929  in Brookline  Mass.  O'Connor received an A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1951. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1951 to 1953. During 1954 and 1955 O'Connor completed the requirements for a master's degree in business administration at Boston University. He joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Central Personnel Office in 1957.O'Connor began his long association with Draper Laboratory in 1964  when he became the personnel director for its forerunner  the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. He was deeply involved in the process of evaluating how to transition the laboratory from being a division of MIT to operating as an independent  private  not-for-profit organization.Upon the laboratory's divestment from MIT in 1973  O'Connor became executive assistant to the president of Draper Lab. That year he also became assistant secretary of the corporation. In 1981  O'Connor was named vice president for human resources and administration. Upon his retirement in 1994  he was elected secretary of the corporation  a position he held through 2005.O'Connor is survived by his wife  Patricia (Rowley)  of Yarmouth Port  Mass.; a son  Michael O'Connor of Denver  Colo.; a daughter  Catherine Hartman of Hingham; and two grandsons.A celebration of O'Connor's life was held Friday  June 15  at The Meeting House on King's Way  Yarmouth Port.Donations may be made to theJimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Instituteor to a charity of one's choosing.
E. Cary Brown  fiscal policy expert  dies at 91,E. Cary Brown  a leading expert on fiscal policy and the economics of taxation and a member of the MIT economics faculty for more than 60 years  passed away on June 8.  He was 91.As a professor of economics at MIT  Brown taught a wide range of graduate and undergraduate courses on tax policy design  statistical methods for economics and the economics of fiscal policy.A memorial service will be held later this year  and details will be posted on the MIT economics department web site atecon-www.mit.edu/.Brown was born on April 14  1916  in Bakersfield  Calif.  He received the B.A. degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1937 and pursued graduate work in economics at Berkeley and Harvard. His graduate studies were interrupted by World War II.  Brown served as an economist at the War Production Board in 1940-41 and as an economist at the Division of Tax Research at the U.S. Treasury Department between 1942 and 1947.  He received his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1948.Brown joined the MIT faculty in 1947 and was promoted to full professor in 1958.  He was a Guggenheim Fellow  a Ford Foundation Faculty Fellow and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as department head for Economics for 18 years  presiding over a period of departmental expansion and a time when MIT achieved recognition as one of the world's leading economics departments. He retired from the MIT faculty in 1986 and served as an emeritus professor until his death.Brown was widely acclaimed for his seminal research on the design of depreciation allowances  the income tax provisions that permit corporations and other investors who purchase long-lived assets to claim tax deductions as these assets decay. In a classic 1948 study  "Business Income Taxation and Investment Incentives " Brown outlined a fundamental set of relationships between the investment credit a firm receives when it makes an investment  the present discounted value of subsequent depreciation allowances and the effective tax burden on new investments.  His insights have remained a touchstone for virtually all subsequent research on this issue and still feature in the public policy debate on the choice between income and consumption taxation.Brown was also an expert on broader issues of fiscal policy.  His 1956 paper on "Fiscal Policy in the Thirties: A Reappraisal" was one of the first applications of the full-employment budget deficit concept. In contrast to the then-prevailing wisdom  the study suggested that fiscal policy had not been particularly expansionary through much of this period  thereby calling into question the extent to which fiscal policy could have contributed to the U.S. economy's recovery from the depths of the Great Depression.Brown was a leader in the post-World War II research effort to understand the economic effects of different tax instruments and to design an equitable and efficient tax system.  Policy-makers often sought his advice on questions of tax policy  and he was a frequent consultant to the U.S. Treasury Department.  In the early 1960s  he was actively involved in the Kennedy Administration's consideration of proposals for accelerated depreciation for capital goods  and he was one of the architects of the 1962 investment tax credit.Brown was an avid tennis player throughout his life.  After his retirement from MIT  he played on the Super Seniors Tennis circuit  competing throughout the United States and winning several competitions in various age groups. He remained an active tennis player until he was 88.A long-time resident of Concord  Brown is survived by three sisters  Phyllys Ohanian of Newton  Mass.  Molly Canan of Philomath  Ore.  and Constance Morse of Plymouth  Mich.; and one brother  Lewis Brown of New York City. He is also survived by his daughters  Rebecca Brown Corwin of Roslindale  Mass.  and Gretchen Brown Rossman of Amherst  Mass.; two granddaughters  three great-grandchildren and two stepchildren.His first wife  Tomlin E.

Ivan D. Dimitrov  of Sofia and Senior House  dies at 20,Ivan D. Dimitrov  an undergraduate from Sofia  Bulgaria  who was known among friends for his positive nature and passion for life  died on Saturday  April 21  as a result of injuries from a motorcycle crash.Dimitrov  20  was fatally injured at about 3:30 a.m. when he lost control of his 1998 Kawasaki 600 motorcycle on the Fenway exit ramp off Storrow Drive east in Boston  news reports said.Dimitrov had had plans to go to New York City on Saturday night to hear Bulgarian folk music star Milko Kalaydzhiev  according to friends in Senior House  where Dimitrov lived since coming to MIT last September.When he arrived on campus  Dimitrov quickly immersed himself in the close-knit Bulgarian community here  inspiring other students with his infectious good humor and ingenuity for pranks  said a friend and housemate  Illiya Tsekov  a junior in mechanical engineering.He was a fan of all things Bulgarian  particularly its music and its professional soccer team  CSKA  said his friend Ivan Z. Dimitrov  a sophomore in electrical engineering and computer science. The two men (no relation)  who had been friends since high school in Sofia  were both members of the CSKA fan club and went to many soccer games together."He was very special. He was always happy. He set goals for himself and he got them: He wanted to be a croupier last summer  so he did that. He wanted to own a motorcycle  so he did that " said Dimitrov  adding  "He read all the safety manuals. He was a careful driver."Both Tsekov and Dimitrov recalled their friend's capacity to see the potential for humor or high spirits in any situation. It was his idea  they noted  to "claim the suite for Bulgaria  complete with barricades  flags and plastic swords" as a prank on new students. He also gave everyone nicknames  they said.While his successes in math provided him the opportunity to travel widely--he went to Mexico  Greece  Cuba and Russia  they said--his focus remained on returning to Sofia and buying property in the neighborhood where he grew up.He "didn't want to make a lot of money--just enough to live and enjoy life " said his friends.Dimitrov is survived by his mother  Neli  a hotel administrator  his father  Dimiter  owner of a commercial cleaning business  and his younger brother  Dani  all of Sofia.A memorial service will be held at MIT on Saturday. The funeral will be in Sofia.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonApril 25  2007 (download PDF).

He was 80.Backofen taught at MIT for 25 years  retiring in 1975. He designed new courses and a new laboratory and became recognized for bridging theory and practice over a wide range of real-life problems--from automotive stampings to orthopedic implants and the Star Wars defense shield.A paper he wrote in 1964 on "superplasticity" identified the ability of metals  temporarily given a near nano-size grain structure  to behave like Silly Putty. That paper was recognized for its seminal influence on a now-burgeoning global industry at an International Conference on Superplasticity held in Chengdu  China  in June 2006.Born in Rockville  Conn.  on Dec. 8  1925  he graduated as valedictorian from Rockville High School in June 1943  entered MIT within days  and soon enlisted in the U.S. Navy. In February 1946 he graduated from MIT with an ensign's commission and bachelor's degree in metallurgy.By September 1946  he was back at MIT as a graduate student/instructor in the Department of Metallurgy. In 1950 he married Elizabeth (Lib) Wood Warren of Orange  Mass.  and received his doctorate with an appointment as assistant professor in the Department of Metallurgy.Backofen belonged to the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers and the American Society for Metals and Materials  and was elected to membership in Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi. He was the first in his field to receive its three principal achievement awards: for teaching (Bradley Stoughton Award  1958)  research (Howe Medal  1964) and professional leadership (Campbell Lecturer  1973). He was a popular speaker in his profession and was a pioneering popular-science lecturer on live television for the fledgling Channel 2 of Boston's first broadcast from the roller skating rink across Mass. Ave. from MIT.During a sabbatical at Dartmouth College  he wrote a book on his technical specialty  deformation processing  in a systems-analysis context that redefined an ancient field for modern times.In partnership with his wife  he started Hill Farm  where they raised apples  blueberries and Christmas trees  in East Plainfield  N.H. They also ran an American art and antiques business and founded the Lord Timothy Dexter Press  devoted to exploring New Hampshire history.He is survived by his wife; a brother  Albert H.

William Orme-Johnson  inorganic biochemistry expert  dies at 68,MIT Professor Emeritus of Chemistry William H. Orme-Johnson  heralded for his four decades of contributions in the field of inorganic biochemistry  died Jan. 1 after a long illness. He was 68."Bill (called by all  O.J.) was a giant in the field of bioinorganic chemistry " said JoAnne Stubbe  Novartis Professor of Chemistry and professor of biology. "Contributions that his lab made in the mid '70s set the stage for many of the experiments carried out by the bioinorganic community today."A native of El Paso  Texas  Orme-Johnson received his B.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. He was a member of the biochemistry faculty at the University of Wisconsin at Madison for 15 years.In 1980  Orme-Johnson joined the MIT faculty in the then-relatively new research area of biological chemistry; he was an MIT professor of chemistry for the next 18 years. Much lauded for his research  Orme-Johnson coauthored 69 papers in professional journals and held a patent on a scientific procedure."Orme-Johnson was one of the first groups to apply rapid freeze quench methods with analysis using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study metal-based radicals and organic radical intermediates in many enzymatic reactions.  He was the first lab to apply ESEEM (electron spin echo envelope modulation) spectroscopic methods to map out the active site of steroid cytochrome P450 systems using deuteriated steroid substrates " Stubbe said. "He was one of the first to realize that complex bioinorganic cofactors were assembled by complex biosynthetic pathways."In 2002  the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry published a special issue dedicated to Orme-Johnson in recognition of his contributions. The articles were written by Orme-Johnson's former students and collaborators and included an appreciation written by Jack Peisach  professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine."Bill was a wonderful colleague and great contributor to the field of bioinorganic chemistry. His physical studies of metalloproteins  nitrogenase in particular  were very important contributions. It was always inspiring to discuss science with Bill " said Stephen J. Lippard  Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry  who co-taught bioinorganic chemistry classes with Orme-Johnson for many years.For nine years  Orme-Johnson served as a housemaster at Bexley Hall  and he was active in the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science  a non-denominational  independent society that works for a positive relationship between science and religion."Bill was an extraordinary scientist  a wonderful friend and colleague and a great housemaster to the students in Bexley Hall '' said John M. Essigmann  MIT professor of toxicology and chemistry.In 1992  Orme-Johnson taught an MIT Independent Activities Period class  "Applied Chili Chemistry " that was so enthusiastically received that a second section was formed. "He was widely enthusiastic about science and was a great people person " Stubbe said. "Bill was a very strong supporter of young scientists and a champion of my cause  which I much appreciated.  He had a great sense of humor  a great drive and broad knowledge about just about everything."Orme-Johnson is survived by his wife  Carol  a former MIT assistant dean  of Cambridge; three daughters  Ruth Orme-Johnson and McGhee Orme-Johnson of Cambridge and Dolly Orme-Johnson of Philadelphia; and brother and sister-in-law David and Rhoda Orme-Johnson of Seagrove Beach  Fla.A memorial service was held Jan. 6 at First Parish Unitarian Universalist in Arlington.

Stephen Meyer  expert on interaction of science  economics and politics  dies at 54,Stephen M. Meyer  MIT political science professor  an expert in national security issues and a passionate advocate of global biodiversity  died Dec. 10 at the age of 54. The cause was cancer.Meyer  the director of the MIT Project on Environmental Politics and Policy and a member of the MIT Council on the Environment  focused his teaching and research on the interaction of science  economics and politics in policy-making  particularly in the areas of natural resource exploitation  land use and wildlife habitat preservation.A researcher with a wide range of interests  Meyer concentrated on arms control  Soviet military programs and weapons technology when he first joined the MIT faculty in 1980. In 1984  he published his first book  "The Dynamics of Nuclear Proliferation" (University of Chicago Press.)More recently  he turned his attention to environmental issues  publishing "Environmental Protection and Economic Prosperity" (MIT Press) in 2004. In September Meyer published "The End of the Wild" (Boston Review)  a call to action to preserve what is left of species biodiversity  including the creation of trans-regional "meta-reserves." The book strikes a somber note  arguing that  " 'the extinction crisis'--the race to save the composition  structure and organization of biodiversity as it exists today--is over  and we have lost."Meyer received his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan. He joined MIT as an assistant professor in 1980 and earned tenure in 1990. In 1997  he became a faculty associate with the Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine.Meyer also worked in a wide range of non-academic positions  beginning in the 1980s as a consultant to the RAND Corporation and the U.S. government.  From 1992 to 1993  he was the principal investigator for the National Council on Soviet and East European Studies. In the late 1990s  he served on committees of the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries & Wildlife and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. In 2002 he became a principal investigator of the National Science Foundation in the area of dynamics of community-based environmental protection. In 2005 he was awarded the Francis W. Sargent Conservation Award by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.In 2004  Meyer was honored with the Arthur C. Smith Award  which is given to MIT faculty members for meaningful contributions and devotion to undergraduate student life at MIT.Meyer also served on the board of advisors of Advocates for the Future from 1999 to 2002  the editorial board of International Studies Quarterly from 1990 to 1996  and the Committee on Science  Arms Control and National Security of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from 1989 to 1992.  He was an adjunct research fellow at the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University from 1980 to 1995.Meyer  a resident of Sudbury  is the author of numerous journal articles  research papers and book chapters on issues of arms control and the environment. His MIT activities ranged from a seat on the MIT ROTC Committee from 1987 to 1991 to a position on the executive committee of the Center for International Studies from 1988 to 1995.In September  even while struggling with cancer  Meyer agreed to write an essay about the issues he explored in "The End of the Wild" for the Boston Globe  using speech-to-text software because  as he told the Globe editors  his hands were paralyzed. In an e-mail to editors  published by the Globe on Sept. 3  Meyer wrote  "This will undoubtedly be the last article I ever publish and I'm happy about the message it carries."In the article  Meyer concluded: "The global biodiversity collapse underway is unstoppable. Yet we can influence how it plays out in our own backyards. Obviously we should protect ourselves from insect-borne disease. But our solutions must be effective  and we must thoroughly examine the consequences. This means becoming more aware of the diversity of life sharing space with us and how our individual actions matter. It would be a shame if fireflies  spring peepers and lady slippers become mere museum displays to our grandchildren."Meyer is survived by his wife  Deborah M. Dineen; a son  Seth Meyer; his parents  Harvey and Rebecca Meyer of Worcester; a brother  Kenneth Meyer of Henderson  Tenn.; a sister  Deborah Blumenthal of Rockville  New York; and nephews.A memorial visitation will be held Wednesday  Dec. 13  from 3 to 7:30 p.m. at the Duckett-J.S.

Stephen Heywood  son of Prof. John Heywood  dies at 37,Stephen Heywood  son of MIT mechanical engineering professor John B. Heywood  died Sunday  Nov. 26 in Newton-Wellesley Hospital. He was 37.Stephen Heywood's eight-year battle with Lou Gehrig's disease was featured in the book "His Brother's Keeper" and in the recent documentary  "So Much  So Fast."Heywood died two days after his ventilator became accidentally disconnected  according to his family.John Heywood is director of MIT's Sloan Automotive Lab and the Sun Jae Professor of Mechanical Engineering.Stephen Heywood  a strapping 6-foot-3-inch carpenter  was restoring his dream house in Palo Alto  Calif.  in 1998 when he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  a neuromuscular illness that gradually destroys the central nervous system. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease  in honor of the New York Yankees first baseman who died of ALS in 1941.Upon learning of his younger brother's illness  Stephen's brother Jamie  a 1991 MIT graduate  abandoned his career in technology development at the Neurosciences Institute outside San Diego to create a foundation to hasten potential clinical applications of basic ALS research. Now the largest worldwide test factory for possible medications and treatments of ALS  theALS Therapy Development Foundationhas 13 full-time scientists and $20 million in funding.After his diagnosis  Stephen Heywood moved to Newton  Mass.  to be close to his tight-knit family  who all participated in his care as his paralysis progressed. He was eventually forced to use a wheelchair and to communicate via an implant in his brain that allowed him to move a cursor on a computer screen  similar to the method used by fellow ALS sufferer Stephen Hawking  the renowned British physicist.The Heywood story inspired a book  "His Brother's Keeper " written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Jonathan Weiner  and a wide range of media coverage. In a film completed last year  Newton-based filmmakers Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan captured Heywood's physical deterioration in an intimate family portrait while documenting its effects on his relationships  especially with his wife  Wendy  and his brother Jamie."Stephen is gone  left in our hearts and in the relationships and structures he has built " Jamie wrote in an e-mail message to friends soon after he learned of his brother's death at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. "Stephen was in command of his world and his body at all times and never lived life on anything other than his own terms.""Stephen's real work  of course  was to raise awareness of ALS  to spur his brother's research work  and to live a rich and considered life in spite of cruel odds " Burr wrote.He is survived by his wife  Wendy  and son  Alexander.A memorial service will be held Sunday  Dec. 3  at 3 p.m. at Grace Episcopal Church  76 Eldredge St.  Newton Corner.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonDecember 6  2006 (download PDF).

George B. Thomas  mathematics professor and author  dies at 92,George B. Thomas  a mathematician who turned a one-year teaching appointment at MIT into a 38-year career and whose well-regarded textbook has been used around the world  died Oct. 31 of natural causes in State College  Pa. He was 92.Thomas  known as a young teacher for his ability to communicate mathematical concepts  was hired in 1951 by publisher Addison-Wesley to revise their then-standard  widely used calculus textbook. Rather than revise  he wrote his own  a classic text that has been in use for 54 years.At MIT  Thomas came to be regarded as an outstanding teacher  "one of the best teachers the department has ever had " according to then Department Head Ted Martin. Not only did he teach a wide variety of subjects  but he also willingly took on new courses.  Administratively  he served as executive officer of the department for ten years and as graduate registration officer from 1962-67.Thomas was born Jan. 11  1914  in Boise  Idaho. His mother died in the influenza pandemic in 1919  and young George grew up in sometimes difficult circumstances. At one point he lived in a tent with his father and stepmother. "It must have been sort of hard times  because I can remember going out with her to pick weeds of some kind along the roadside that were edible " he recalled afterward  according to his daughter  Fay Bakhru.His father's work in a bank helped lead Thomas to discover his own fascination with numbers. After studies at Spokane University and Washington State College  which led to bachelor's and master's degrees  Thomas hoped to become a high school math teacher  but "that somehow didn't work out " as he related afterward.During World War II  Thomas helped program the differential analyzer for the calculation of firing tables for the Navy.After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in October 1957  Thomas was part of a national effort to improve math and science education in American schools. He also traveled to India on a Ford Foundation grant to teach Indian instructors how he and his American colleagues taught math.Thomas worked in a shoe store for a time to save money for doctoral studies  and eventually went to Cornell  where he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1940  and then came to MIT  from which he retired in 1978.Thomas' commitment to education went well beyond MIT. From 1955-57  he served on the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America  an organization devoted to mathematics  especially at the undergraduate level. He was elected its first Vice-President 1958-59. Thomas also served on the Executive Committee  Mathematics Division  of the American Society for Engineering Education from 1956-59. He was a member of the Commission on Mathematics of the College Entrance Examination Board  1955-58  for which he co-authored monographs on mathematics  and spoke at numerous forums about teaching and high school curriculum reform. In addition to his calculus text  which had a significant impact  he was also one of the editors on a series of high school mathematics texts for Addison-Wesley Publishing.Twice widowed  Thomas is survived by two daughters  Fay  of Glen Mills  Pa.  and Jean H. Thomas of West Chester  Pa.; a son  James H. Thomas of Owls Head  Maine; a stepson  Brad Waldron of Beverly  Mass.  two stepdaughters  Melissa Goggin of Beverly  Mass.  and Susan Hamill of Maine; three sisters  Mary Nelson of Twin Falls  Idaho  Carol Hypes of Greeley  Colo.  and Peggy Turner of Lubbock  Texas; three grandchildren;  five great-grandchildren;  and six step-grandchildren.A remembrance was held at the family home.

Fred Sanders  pioneer storm forecaster  dies,Frederick Sanders  professor emeritus of meteorology and mentor and friend to an entire generation of weather researchers  died on Oct. 6 after a long illness. He was 83 and had been a longtime resident of Marblehead.Sanders was pre-eminent in the field of synoptic meteorology  which seeks to understand weather systems such as fronts and cyclones by careful analysis and interpretation of weather observations. He made important contributions to the analysis  understanding  and prediction of fronts  low pressure systems  hurricanes  squall lines  and flood-producing storms  and he coined the term "bomb" to describe explosively intensifying winter storms.Sanders helped develop one of the first successful computer models for forecasting hurricane tracks  as well as new techniques for forecasting rain and snow amounts. He pioneered methods for evaluating the skill of both human and computer weather forecasts  stressing the need for quantifying the uncertainty of the forecasts; this work also led to improvements in numerical weather prediction models.Together with his colleague Richard Reed  he elevated the field of synoptic meteorology to the status of a respected science  to the benefit of the field and to generations of students. He was the recipient of many awards and was a fellow of the American Meteorological Society as well as the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2004  the American Meteorological Society held a scientific colloquium in his honor.Born in Detroit on May 17  1923  Sanders spent much of his childhood in Bloomfield Hills  Mich. After attending Amherst College  where he studied mathematics  economics and music  Sanders enlisted in 1941 in the Army Air Corps  which was recruiting math and physics students to be trained as weather forecasters.  He spent 15 months at MIT studying math  physics and meteorology and graduated as a second lieutenant shortly after D-Day in Normandy. He was assigned to Greenland  where he made weather predictions to assist flight crews.After World War II ended  Sanders worked briefly as an air inspector at Headquarters Eight Weather Group at Grenier Air Force Base in New Hampshire. In 1946  he decided to become a professional weather forecaster rather than join his father's candy manufacturing business. He spent two years as a transatlantic aviation forecaster for the U.S. Weather Bureau at La Guardia Field then returned to MIT  where he earned an Sc.D. degree in 1954. He then joined the faculty of MIT's Department of Meteorology  where he remained until his retirement in 1984.Sanders preferred to spend most of his professional time preparing lectures and interacting with students. He influenced his field not only through his own research but also through nurturing the talents of his students. Sanders took entire classes for outings on his sailing yacht Stillwater  bringing joy as well as knowledge to the study of weather.Sanders was a passionate sailor  and participated in many ocean races  including the Newport-Bermuda and Marblehead-Halifax races. He also loved to cruise the coast of Maine and the Canadian Maritimes with his family and friends. An accomplished tenor  he sang with the MIT Choral Society and more recently with a choral group in Marblehead."I don't think we will ever see his equal--not just for his scientific insight  but his outgoing nature  his helpfulness  his sometimes acerbic wit  and without fail remaining the consummate gentleman at all times " said his friend and colleague  Ed Zipser.Sanders is survived by his wife  Nancy (Brown) Sanders; two sons  John Sanders and Duncan Sanders-Fleming; a daughter  Christopher Sanders; and several grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonNovember 1  2006 (download PDF).

'Father of molecular medicine ' Vernon Ingram dies at 82,Vernon Ingram  an MIT biology professor known as the "father of molecular medicine " died Aug. 17 from injuries suffered during a fall. He was 82.A memorial service has been scheduled for Sunday  Sept. 10th at 2 p.m. in Wong Auditorium (E51).  A reception will follow at Ashdown House.Ingram was best known for his discovery  during the 1950s  that a single amino acid substitution is responsible for the molecular abnormality that leads to sickle cell anemia.The find was "one of the absolutely seminal discoveries in the history of molecular biology " said Graham Walker  MIT professor of biology.Walker  who was Ingram's friend and colleague for 30 years  said that Ingram was "one of the greatest men I have met in my life. An extraordinary scientist  an extraordinary intellect  and an absolutely wonderful human being."In recent years  Ingram focused his research on neuroscience  especially Alzheimer's disease. Though in his 80s  he still ran a small laboratory at MIT and was constantly pursuing new research  Walker said."He was a dyed-in-the-wool  inveterate experimentalist " Walker said. "He was going at full speed right up until the end."Ingram and his wife  Elizabeth  served as housemasters at Ashdown House from 1985 until a few years ago."They were just extraordinarily dedicated to their students " Walker said.Ingram was also a dedicated teacher and had served as director of the Experimental Studies Group (ESG).Holly Sweet  current director of ESG  described Ingram as an "inspirational teacher  and a compassionate and spirited man who promoted the professional growth of his staff. As far as his legacy to ESG is concerned  he was the guiding force behind our ever-growing seminar series. He truly put the 'experimental' into the Experimental Study Group. We will miss him a great deal."Ingram was born in Breslau  Germany  in 1924. He studied at Birkbeck College at the University of London  earning his B.Sc. in chemistry in 1945 and his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1949. He then spent two years in the United States preparing and crystallizing proteins at the Rockefeller Institute and studying peptide chemistry at Yale.In 1952  Ingram returned to England  where he studied protein chemistry in the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University. He focused on the genetics of hemoglobin  the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.  Those studies led to his discovery that the misshapen hemoglobin molecules that characterize sickle cell anemia are caused by a single mutation.Ingram joined the MIT faculty in 1958 and was one of a distinguished group of professors who started a world-renowned center for the study of molecular and cell biology. He originally planned to stay at MIT for only one year  but "I liked it so much that I stayed " he told the National Academy of Sciences in 2002  the year he was elected to that society.In 1961  Birkbeck College awarded him the D.Sc. degree.He enjoyed art  music and photography  and was very involved with the Rockport Chamber Music Festival (RCMF).RCMF Artistic Director David Deveau  who is also a pianist and a senior lecturer in music at MIT  worked closely with Ingram for the past decade."Vernon served with great distinction on the board of directors of the RCMF and brought a wonderful energy and commitment to our enterprise. He and Beth attended most of the festival concerts  enjoyed hosting musicians  talking music and throwing wonderful parties. Vernon brought his natural scientific curiosity to everything he undertook  and music was no exception. We often had substantive conversations about the merits of a given performance or composition " Deveau said.Ingram is survived by his wife; a son  Peter; and a daughter  Jennifer.Condolence cards may be sent to MIT Department of Biology  Attn: Mary Markel Murphy  Bldg. 68-132  77 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139-4307.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonSeptember 13  2006 (download PDF).
Bill Dickson '56  retired senior vice president  dies,William R. Dickson  a retired senior vice president who supervised major building projects that tripled the size of MIT's campus  died Aug. 14 after suffering a heart attack.  He was 71.Dickson worked at MIT for nearly 40 years  starting in Physical Plant and working his way up to senior vice president  a title he held for 16 years before retiring in 1998. As senior vice president  he was responsible for most of the operations of the Institute and much of the financial planning and activities.During his tenure  he was involved in a number of building projects  including Kresge Auditorium  the Green Building  Eastgate  Westgate  McCormick  the Whitaker Building  Building 16 and the Stata Center."Bill was a bridge from the MIT of the 1950s to the MIT of the 21st century. We all benefited from his dedicated work  his straight talk and his inherent wisdom " said MIT President Emeritus Charles Vest.Dickson graduated from MIT in 1956 with a degree in building construction and engineering (Course 17).  He spent two years as a staff engineer at Lincoln Laboratory then became an associate scientist at Avco Corp. in Wilmington. He returned to MIT as assistant to the director of Physical Plant in 1960 and became director of Physical Plant in 1971.  In 1980  he was appointed vice president for operations  and he was named senior vice president in 1982."He was a wise and effective leader " Vest said. "As befitted his years of experience  he had a knack for 'managing out of his hip pocket ' because he knew everybody and everything about the campus.  He was completely devoid of ego and was revered by employees at all levels throughout MIT."When Dickson retired  he told The Tech student newspaper that his proudest accomplishment was helping the Institute grow from 3.5 million square feet of built space in 1960 to 10 million square feet at the time he left.MIT's co-generation plant  which is named for Dickson  was built after he initiated the project to combine hot water production with electricity generation in one plant. The facility  which uses natural gas to make the electricity that powers 80 percent of MIT's buildings  has won awards for design and environmental excellence.President Emeritus Paul Gray  who appointed Dickson senior vice president in 1982  said that Dickson was recognized early in his career as "not only an outstanding engineer but also an effective motivator and manager of others. He had a splendid memory of people and could call by name not only the men and women in his areas of responsibility but many others among the faculty and administration of the Institute.""The cost savings in the operation of the non-academic side of MIT achieved as a result of Bill's insights and wisdom are beyond reckoning. However  I am quite certain that the ongoing savings achieved as a direct consequence of the decisions and actions taken during his stewardship amount  at present  to more than $100 million per year  every year  possibly much more " Gray said. "We will not soon see his equal."Among his colleagues  Dickson was known not only for his encyclopedic knowledge of the Institute  but also for his ability to make things happen."He had a terrific grasp on the workings of MIT and how to get things done " said Jay Keyser  professor emeritus of linguistics and philosophy and former associate provost who served on the Academic Council with Dickson."He came up through the ranks  as it were " Keyser said. "He was somebody who never lost touch with the rank and file. He was one of them  and he understood where they came from."Institute Professor John Deutch said that Dickson had a personal touch in all of his interactions that inspired great loyalty among the people he worked with."I think Bill Dickson is probably one of the best examples of what an MIT person is -- he had devotion to the place  and devotion to dealing with every individual to try to solve their problems and make their experience better " said Deutch. "And he didn't do it by bureacracy."Dickson was also known for his sense of humor and his respect for everyone he worked with."One of the things that separated Bill from so many others was his treatment of people " said Sue Crowley  Dickson's longtime assistant. "He treated everyone with respect  was truly a man of the people  and he could relate to all levels of individuals -- professors  donors  City of Cambridge officials  senior officers and service staff. He was always very approachable and accessible to everyone."Dickson was a lifelong resident of Framingham and a 1952 graduate of Framingham High School. He served as chairman of the MetroWest Medical Center board of trustees for 12 years.He is survived by his wife  Ann (Lingley) Dickson; two sons  Christopher Dickson of Medway and Jeffrey Dickson of San Francisco; a daughter  Julie Ferrari of Framingham; a brother  Lee Dickson of Florida; and seven grandchildren.An afternoon remembrance will be held at the family home on Sunday  Aug. 27 ï¿½ï¿½from 2 to 6 p.m.  at 220 Singletary Lane  Framingham.Donations may be made to the William R.

Professor Robert W. Mann  leader in prosthetics  dies at 81,Robert W. Mann  an engineer and former rocket scientist who developed the world's first biomedical prosthetic device  died Friday  June 16  of a heart attack. A longtime resident of Lexington  Mass.  and Moultonborough  N.H.  Mann was 81.Mann joined the MIT faculty in 1953  serving as a professor of mechanical engineering for almost 40 years. During that time  he also served as Whitaker Professor of Biomedical Engineering and as director of MIT's Eric P. and Evelyn E. Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation from 1974 until his retirement in 1992.Mann will "certainly be missed tremendously. He was a leader in the field of design in the true sense of the word. He was instrumental in turning design into a discipline. Bob was deeply engaged in the department in very positive ways until the very end  attending our bi-weekly faculty luncheons without fail " said Rohan Abeyaratne  head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering.Born in 1924 in Brooklyn  N.Y.  Mann attended Brooklyn Technical High School  after which he entered the U.S. Army  serving in the Pacific Theater in World War II.He came to MIT as a student on the GI Bill in 1947  and received the S.B. degree in 1950  the S.M. in 1951 and the Sc.D. in 1957.During the 1950s  Mann conducted research on internal power systems that led to the development of Sparrow I and III and Hawk missiles. By the mid 1960s  his research was focused primarily on applying technology to human disabilities.In a 1997 talk at MIT about his fruitful career  Mann characteristically combined modesty with enthusiasm in describing how he made the switch from "powering rockets to powering people " as he put it.A fellow veteran who had lost his sight and one arm in the Battle of the Bulge inspired Mann's first applications of technology to help people with disabilities. Collaborating with John Kenneth Dupress  the blind veteran  and others  Mann inaugurated the Sensory Aids Evaluation and Development Project in 1964. English-to-Braille computer translation systems  the award-winning MIT Braille Embosser and electronic travel aids for the blind resulted from that project.Helping the disabledNext  Mann applied his knowledge of computer-aided design -- another area in which he was a pioneer -- to his experience with powering rocket systems and his commitment to helping those with disabilities."You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see even an amputated arm still has muscle [above the lost limb]  which the brain still directs " Mann said once  referring to the electrical impulses that connect the brain and muscles and that can also "power" biomechanical devices. Mann's Boston Arm was the first artificial limb to rely on a combination of biology and technology for its control.Mann's studies of skeletal joints and osteoarthritis  together with related computer-aided imagery  have explicated the biomechanical role of cartilage and include the only measurements of pressures on and in cartilage in vivo in the human hip. He designed a caliper-like sizing device to make sure the replacement ball used in hip surgery fits perfectly."I'm an engineer. The way we think  a bone is a link; a joint is a bearing; a muscle is an actuator; ligaments and tissues are springs " Mann said about his lifelong approach to design challenges. Throughout his career  he credited Brooklyn Tech for providing him "superb preparation in good  practical arts -- foundry  forge and machine shop."While teaching and mentoring graduate students at MIT  Mann was also involved in development of the Utah Elbow and the MIT Knee  along with Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering Woodie C. Flowers (Ph.D. 1972)  then a graduate student.Mann's service to MIT was as dedicated and innovative as his research on biomechanics: He was devoted to teaching  advising for more than 300 theses at MIT  and to nurturing the Institute's sense of community. He and his family opened their home to students for an annual chicken dinner  his daughter  Catherine Mann (Ph.D 1984)  recalled.Mann transformed the design curriculum in mechanical engineering at MIT in the 1960s by introducing project-oriented courses  involving students in the entire design process.In 1983-84  Mann served as president of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT  only the second faculty member to so serve in the 20th century. He also served as president of the Class of 1950 for 50 years.Awards and honorsHis contributions have been acknowledged at MIT through the award of two endowed chairs and his receipt in 1983-84 of the James R.

Alan Kotok  64  created joystick,Computer pioneer Alan Kotok  an MIT alumnus who helped create both the first video game and the gaming joystick  died of a heart attack in his home in Cambridge  Mass.  on Friday  May 26. A native of Philadelphia  he was 64.Kotok (S.B. 1962) entered MIT at age 16 and became swiftly involved in developing chess-playing computer programs  designing new systems for MIT's Tech Model Railroad and  with a group of friends  coming up with their original video game  Spacewar.Tim Berners-Lee  founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  which is housed in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  described Kotok as "one of the early wise men of computer science."The unflappable Kotok was "not only technically adept well beyond the norm  but also possessed a childlike delight in all things ingenious or intriguing. Wit  wisdom and sheer human warmth defined him  yet he commanded total respect.  He would humbly take on anything which simply needed doing " Berners-Lee said.Kotok had been W3C associate chairman since 1997. In highlighting Kotok's many contributions to the field that literally grew up with him  Berners-Lee pointed to Kotok's important programs for early Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) and IBM computers  including the well-known Kotok-McCarthy chess program at MIT  which became Kotok's S.B. thesis.Kotok spent 34 years with DEC in numerous leadership roles  retiring in 1996. He served as technical director for product strategy and development groups in telecommunications  storage and Internet.While at DEC  he was chief architect of the PDP-10 family of computers and a logic designer for the early DEC PDP-6 computer. Later  he became chief architect on the influential DECsystem-10 timesharing computer system and a senior consultant to Digital's Alta Vista project  an early Internet search engine.Gordon Bell  senior researcher in Microsoft's Media Presence Research Group  worked with Kotok at DEC in the 1960s. Kotok was "calm  constant and unflappable with a wonderful sense of humor. He loved telephony and probably knew more about it than anyone in the company. This was invaluable to us as communication is the mainstay of computing today."Kotok also provided leadership as a member of the Corporate Strategy Group  which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies.Kotok  whose daughter Leah affectionately called him "King Nerd " had a lifelong interest in all things mechanical.His love of trains  which surged into passion at MIT  arose in childhood: His father owned a New Jersey hardware store that sold toy trains at Christmas  and Kotok set up the annual train displays.As for electronics  a family legend tells how Kotok  then 5   stuck a metal screwdriver into an electric outlet and was tossed across a room. Kotok himself recalled this with characteristic understatement -- "I was always interested in electrical engineering!" -- in a 2004 interview.In the same interview  Kotok described his 1956 encounter with a "giant thinking machine" on a school field trip to the Mobil Research Lab in New Jersey as the "spark that triggered me. We went through a programming exercise  punched up the cards  put them into the machine and the printer clank-clanked and we got the answers. I said  'Computers! This is it!'"Kotok married the former Judith McCoy in 1977; she died in 2005.Kotok is survived by two daughters  Leah Beth Kotok of Ashburnham  Mass. and Frederica Beck of Prescott  Ariz.; a son and daughter-in-law  Daryl and Shelly Beck of Greenfield  Mass.; and two grandsons.The funeral was private. A memorial service is being planned for the fall.Donations in Kotok's memory may be made to the Westfield Center for Early Keyboard Studies  P.O. Box 505  Orcas  WA 98280; the Computer History Museum  1401 N. Shoreline Blvd.  Mountain View  CA 94043; or the Judith Kotok Memorial Scholarship  c/o the Longy School of Music  One Follen St.  Cambridge  MA 02138.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonJune 14  2006 (download PDF).

Memorial service slated tomorrow for Pushpinder Singh,A memorial service will be held at MIT Thursday  March 9  for Pushpinder Singh  a postdoctoral associate in the MIT Media Lab who died Feb. 28 in Cambridge. He was 33.The service will be held in the MIT Chapel at 3 p.m.Singh's research centered on giving computers human-like common sense -- the ability to think about the everyday world as people do --but his interests ranged from developing a theory of beauty to developing an architecture for reflective thinking  according to Media Lab colleagues."Push's work has opened the possibility for a true partnership between people and machines " said Walter Bender  senior research scientist and former executive director of the Media Lab."None of us will ever adapt to this loss ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Push served as a model of intellectual power  kindness and honesty " wrote Marvin Minsky  professor of media arts and sciences emeritus at MIT. Minsky was Singh's advisor and mentor for many years. "He was like a comet lighting up the intellectual sky with his brilliant  deep ideas and his beautiful personality. His blazing trail remains in his many writings  publications  notes and in the memory networks of his friends. We were all just beginning to know the range and the depth of his ideas.""Push had great warmth " Bender said. "He was building upon that warmth  developing a model of mind that was attuned to human goals."Media Lab research scientist Henry Lieberman said  "I saw in Push a great example of the pioneer spirit of the earlier days of AI (artificial intelligence). This means not being afraid to tackle the big questions -- common sense  knowledge  problem solving  story understanding  vision."Born in Dehradun  India  Singh grew up in Canada  and earned his S.B. and M.Eng. in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT in 1998. He was named one of the "IEEE Intelligent Systems 10 to Watch " an award that honors young researchers in artificial intelligence. He planned to take a faculty position at the Media Lab this fall."Push was trying to implement a cognitive architecture; a system that can react  deliberate and reflect. This is unique and ambitious work for the field of artificial intelligence " said Dustin Smith  a Media Lab graduate student working on common sense computing. Benjamin Mako Hill  another graduate student who worked closely with Singh  added  "In the last several decades  artificial intelligence has concentrated on specialized areas  but Push was making real  visible steps toward AI's original  larger goal of artificial minds and intelligent systems -- truly smart computers."Singh is survived by his parents  Mahender and Kulwant Singh of Montreal  Quebec; two sisters  Vindi Singh of San Francisco and Raminder Singh of Schaumburg  Ill.; and his partner  Barbara Barry of Cambridge.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonMarch 8  2006 (download PDF).

Professor emeritus Alvin Drake dies at 70,Alvin W. Drake  a professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science who was respected among colleagues and students alike for the vitality of his teaching and the vigor of his research  died of cancer at a hospice near his Falmouth home on Sunday  Oct. 30. He was 70.Drake  a native of Bayonne  N.J.  specialized in decision analysis  applied probability  applications of operations research to public systems and blood and organ banking.Drake's best-known MIT course  Probabilistic Systems Analysis (6.041)  was "legendary " said Richard Larson  Mitsui Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and of Engineering Systems. "He taught students to think in terms of basic principles  in the MIT way."Ethernet inventor Robert Metcalfe (S.B. 1968)  who was a student of Drake's  called him the "epitome of the MIT professor." Metcalfe even gave Drake partial credit for igniting the intellectual fuse that eventually led Metcalfe to Ethernet in 1973.Drake's own enthusiasm for the Institute and his devotion to the "MIT way" were leavened by his awareness of the toll of competitiveness on self-esteem.In a 1993 essay  "Notes on Being at a Great  but Greatly Intimidating Place " Drake encouraged students and faculty not to let others' brilliance make them "less special  less bright or less alive."Drake himself was willing to take risks  such as launching MIT and the then-fledgling Operations Research Center (ORC) into the analysis of public systems."This pioneering work led to major research in blood banking  airport operations and urban public safety. It put MIT ORC on the map of public sector operations research " Larson said.Drake's particular interests in operations research included blood banking systems and public attitudes and decision processes with regard to blood donation. He served as a director of the Red Cross Northeast Regional Blood Program.Drake came to MIT as an instructor in 1960 and taught continuously  except for service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps (1962-1964) and sabbaticals at Harvard and Berkeley  until his retirement at the end of 1996.He served as associate director of the Operations Research Center from 1966 to 1977 and was promoted to full professor in 1973.He wrote the classic text "Fundamentals of Probability Theory" (1967) and co-authored "The American Blood Supply" (1982) with Stan N. Finkelstein  senior research scientist  Engineering Systems Division  and Harvey M. Sapolsky  professor of political science.In his later years  Drake worked with students in the Engineering Systems Division (ESD) and in the Leaders for Manufacturing Program (LFM)."As a mentor  teacher and advisor to students in the LFM program  he touched students in the same way he touched me as a student in the 1960s " said Donald Rosenfield  director of the LFM Fellows Program.In 1991  Drake received the School of Engineering's Amar Bose Award for excellence in teaching.Joel Moses  former dean of the School of Engineering  said at the time that one of Drake's "many strengths is the ability to re-create  in a class of nearly 200 students  the atmosphere of a class of 20."In 1995  Drake was appointed Ford Professor of Engineering. Moses noted then Drake's "innovative teaching of applied probability and his mentoring of graduate teaching assistants."The next year  on the eve of his last session teaching 6.041  Drake received a unique honor.Speaking for four decades of MIT students  the MIT Chorallaries sang an a cappella verse they composed for their beloved probability professor:"Professor Drake's retiring  we hate to see him goHe always has supported us -- he's even come to shows!We've sung here each and every term and had a lot of funAs the official a cappella group of Drake's 6.041!"Drake received four degrees from MIT: the S.B. and S.M. in 1958  the E.E. in 1961 and the Sc.D. in 1962.Drake married Julie Atwood in 1995. He is survived by his wife; stepson Todd C. Wheelden and his wife  Babette  of Kents Hill  Maine; two grandsons  Drake and Fenix Wheelden; and a brother  Jerome  of Somerville  Mass.A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. on Saturday  Nov. 5  at the Popponesset Inn in Mashpee  Mass.A celebration of life service will be held at a later date at MIT.Donations in Drake's honor may be sent to the Mary McCarthy Hospice House  270 Communication Way  Hyannis  MA 02601; MSPCA  1577 Falmouth Road  Centerville  MA 02632; or Big Brother Big Sister Foundation  5 Mear Road  Holbrook  MA 02343.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonNovember 2  2005 (download PDF).

Institute Professor Philip Morrison dies at 89,MIT Institute Professor Emeritus Philip Morrison  a distinguished theoretical astrophysicist and interpreter of science and technology for the general public  died Friday  April 22  at his home. He was 89.The physics department is planning a memorial celebration in his honor on Saturday  September 10th  2005  at 11:00 a.m. in Kresge Auditorium  followed by a reception.A member of the Manhattan Project who went on to become a vocal critic of the nuclear arms race  Morrison was widely known for his research and professional contributions in quantum electrodynamics  nuclear theory  radiology  isotope geology and  since the 1950s  in cosmic-ray origins and propagation  gamma-ray astronomy and other topics in high-energy astrophysics and in cosmology."The world has lost one of the major voices of social conscience in science. For more than 50 years  since his involvement in the development of the first atomic bomb  Philip Morrison has been a leading participant in the efforts to control and eliminate nuclear weapons " said Charles Weiner  MIT Professor Emeritus of the History of Science."Phil was a great physicist. His field was astrophysics  but he was interested in all of physics " said Marc A. Kastner  head of MIT's Department of Physics. "In addition  he was deeply committed to education  both at the undergraduate level and for younger students.""He was a dear  dear person whose impact was not just on MIT  but on the world " said Weiner  who has been working to document Morrison's life through archival materials and oral-history interviews.A member of the MIT faculty since 1964  Morrison has held the rank of Institute Professor  the highest honor awarded by the MIT faculty and administration  since 1973. The title is reserved for those who have demonstrated exceptional distinction by a combination of leadership  accomplishment and service in the scholarly  educational and general intellectual life of the Institute or wider community.He was among the first scientists (in 1959) to call upon the professional community to begin a coordinated search for interstellar communications using a microwave search. His many publications and speeches  beyond research and astronomy  center on two large issues: nuclear and conventional war and American policy; and the teaching and public understanding of physics and science in general. He has authored or co-authored many books on these subjects  including "The Price of Defense " which he co-authored with five other students of the arms issue. The book  published in 1979  was the first to propose a detailed alternative defense posture for the United States.A regular reviewer of books on science for Scientific American since 1965  Morrison had also narrated and helped script films on science for Charles and Ray Eames. He appeared widely on radio and on British  Canadian and American television in a number of science programs and series  most visibly as author-presenter (with his wife  the late Phylis Morrison) of a six-part national Public Broadcasting System series  "The Ring of Truth " which first aired in 1987. He and his wife co-authored a book  "The Ring of Truth: An Inquiry Into How We Know What We Know" (Random House  1987) as a companion to the series.Kastner  the Donner Professor of Science  noted that Morrison "was spectacular at explaining physics to the public  too. He was the only person I ever knew who spoke not just in compete sentences  but complete paragraphs. Phil was a wonderful colleague and will be greatly missed.""He was an inspiration not as a scientist who also did other things  but as someone who defined his role as a scientist by being involved in these other things " Weiner said.Philip Morrison was born in Somerville  N.J.  in 1915. He attended Pittsburgh public schools and received the B.S. degree from the Carnegie Institute for Technology in 1936. In 1940 he received the Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California at Berkeley  under the supervision of J. Robert Oppenheimer.For the next two years he taught physics at San Francisco State College and at the University of Illinois before joining the Manhattan Project. In 1946  Morrison joined the physics faculty at Cornell University  where he remained until he came to MIT in 1964.From 1943 to 1946 Morrison was associated with the Manhattan Project  which was responsible for the development of the first atomic bomb. He joined the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago toward the end of 1942. He was a physicist and group leader there and later at Los Alamos from 1942 to 1946.In 1945  it was Morrison  riding in the back seat of an automobile  who brought the bomb's plutonium core from Los Alamos to the New Mexico desert site for the first test. He also was at the island air base of Tinian  from which two bombs were launched against Japan. He later witnessed the aftermath of the explosion at Hiroshima in a visit immediately following the war.In 1984  Morrison's faculty colleagues named him the James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award Lecturer for the academic year 1984-85. The citation read  in part  "Philip Morrison is more than a distinguished scholar. He represents an attitude  a way of life  a symbol for what one might call 'joy of insight' or 'thirst for knowledge.' No one has better demonstrated  or rather embodied  what it means to the human soul to perceive or recognize a new scientific discovery or a new theoretical insight. Scientific knowledge and understanding is not a purely cerebral affair; it is soaked with emotion  excitement  and nervous tension  as everyone knows who has heard Philip Morrison talkâ€¦He has a gift for language and a wide-ranging intellect which allow him to draw upon insights from different fields to help illuminate a subject."His memberships included the American Physical Society (fellow)  the Federation of American Scientists (chairman  1973-76) the American Astronomical Society (council  1977-79)  the International Astronomical Union  the National Academy of Sciences  the American Association of Physics Teachers  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia.Among his many awards are the Pregel Prize of the New York Academy of Sciences  the Babson Prize of the Gravity Foundation  the American Association for the Advancement of Science Westinghouse Science Writing Award  the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers  the Priestly Medallion of Dickinson College  the Presidential Award of the New York Academy of Sciences  1980; the Public Science Medal of the Minnesota Museum of Science  the American Institute of Physics' Andrew Gemant Award and the Wheeler Prize (with Phylis Morrison) of the Boston Museum of Science.A resident of Cambridge  he is survived by his stepson  Bert Singer  and by Singer's wife  Angela Kimberk. A private service is planned.Members of the Boston area physics community are invited to attend theSeptember 10 memorial service.Those who wish to make a tribute will be given the opportunity to do so  briefly  following the program of talks.

Professor  HUD chief Robert Wood dies,Robert C. Wood  a former professor of political science at MIT who went on to lead the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority  the University of Massachusetts and the Boston Public Schools  died Friday at his Boston home of stomach cancer. He was 81."Professor Wood was an outstanding academic practitioner. He applied his research expertise to critical policy issues at the national and state levels and was a true builder of public higher education in the commonwealth of Massachusetts. He was much admired by his MIT colleagues in political science " said Philip Khoury  Kenan Sahin Dean of the School of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences and professor of history."Though Bob Wood's major focus was on urban affairs and the design of cities  he also had a significant interest in the development of policies for science and technology and how those subjects  so central to MIT  affected American life. He developed the first course at MIT in science  technology and public policy jointly with James R. Killian  the nation's first science advisor and previously president of MIT " said Eugene Skolnikoff  professor of political science  emeritus."He was an ideal leader  seeing the larger picture.  I will be forever indebted to him and will miss his wise counsel and continued interest " Skolnikoff said.Wood taught political science at MIT from 1959 to 1965. He served as undersecretary and later secretary of the Housing and Urban Development from 1965 to 1969 and was pivotally involved in implementing the Model Cities program (1966) and the Fair Housing Act (1968).  He returned to MIT to teach and to direct the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard.  At the same time  he led the MBTA.In 1970  he was named president of the University of Massachusetts  a post he held for seven years.A native of Saint Louis  Mo.  Wood achieved notoriety as a national figure who combined intellect  activism and political savvy in his numerous high-level roles  but his first passion  he declared  was cities."I'm essentially an urbanist " he told the Boston Globe in a 1994 interview.His love for cities faced daunting expression during his tenure as superintendent of the Boston Public Schools from 1978 to 1980. The busing crisis had ended with court-ordered desegregation in 1974  but the system still reeled from turmoil when Wood took over."Although desegregation and forced busing are essential  they aren't the true issues " Wood said on taking the post. "The real issue is change in teaching  in employment and in the big-city system."While Wood served as president of the University of Massachusetts he led its expansion to include UMass Medical Center in Worcester and its Boston campus. He also played a key role in bringing the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum to its present site at Columbia Point  next to UMass-Boston.Wood was born on Sept. 16  1923. He won a scholarship to Princeton University  interrupting his studies to serve in the Army. Wood saw action during the Battle of the Bulge  won a Bronze Star  and rose to the rank of sergeant.After graduating from Princeton  Wood earned three degrees from Harvard: a master's in public administration and a master's and a doctorate in government.Wood's best-known book is "Suburbia: Its People and Their Politics" (1958). His other books include "The Necessary Majority: Middle America and the Urban Crisis" (1972)  and "Whatever Possessed the President? Academic Experts and Presidential Policy  1960-88" (1993).Wood leaves his wife  Margaret (Byers); a son  Frank of New York City; two daughters  Frances of Cambridge and Margaret Hassan of Exeter  N.H.; and two grandchildren.A funeral will be held April 11 at 3 p.m. in St. Paul's Cathedral on Tremont Street in Boston.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonApril 6  2005 (download PDF).

Community joins family in mourning death of grad student,Friends of Zhenxiu Mao gathered yesterday afternoon to talk about their memories of his life and share their sorrow with Mao's parents  who traveled from China after learning of their son's death.Mao  a first-year graduate student in mathematics  was found dead in his Cambridge apartment on Feb. 28. He was 23 years old. A reception and short service were held in his memory on March 15  planned by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.The smell of chrysanthemums filled the room in W11 as each guest placed a single flower in a vase near Mao's photograph and peered at a few of the remnants of his short life: his CDs  including Nirvana and The Eagles  a stuffed MIT beaver toy  his bookbag  a mathematics textbook."Zhenxiu  dear son  how come you left your parents who loved you so much and left your just-wed wife to go to an unknown world? We miss you so. We really don't want to let you go " Mao's father  Peijing Mao  read from his notes in Chinese as Yuhua Hu   graduate student in chemical engineering and president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association  translated into English for those students  faculty members and staff present who did not understand Chinese."We know you are an ordinary person  but you achieved extraordinary success in your short life " said Mao's father  touching on his son's generosity and dedication to his family. Mao had saved money from his MIT stipend to buy his father a digital camera and had plans to help pay for the education of his niece and nephew."He was a wonderful and talented student " said Professor Michael Sipser  head of the Department of Mathematics where Mao had been studying since last fall after earning his B.A. and M.S. from Yale University. Sipser said that all the students in the department are exceptional and described Mao as "the best of the best.""I am a parent  too  and I really cannot imagine the pain you must be going through " Sipser said to the Maos.To honor their son  the Maos plan to use the money that Mao earned in mathematics prizes  along with money collected for the family by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at MIT  to establish the Zhenxiu Fund at his high school for students who wish to study mathematics.Mao's father and mother  Shui Liu  arrived Saturday from their home in Ningbo  in the Zhejiang province in China. Friends from Yale University also attended the memorial service at MIT.Mao is survived by his wife  Jingqi Sun  his parents  and his brother  Zhenyi Mao  all of China.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonMarch 16  2005 (download PDF).
Elzbieta Ettinger  writing professor  novelist  dies at 80,Elzbieta Ettinger  a novelist  biographer and professor of writing who helped build the MIT Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies  died of heart failure in her home in Cambridge  Mass.  on Saturday  March 12. She was 80 years old.A native of Warsaw  Poland  Ettinger survived the Holocaust  escaping the Warsaw ghetto shortly before its liquidation; she then worked for the Polish resistance while maintaining a false identity as a Catholic Pole (she was also known by her wartime pseudonym  Elzbieta Chodakowska).  Her experiences during the Second World War were chronicled in her first novel  "Kindergarten" (1968)  described by the New York Times Book Review as a work "one reads with frozen attention."A self-described rebel who believed in the promise of socialism as an antidote to social and economic inequality  Ettinger refused to be silent about the totalitarian nature of the Soviet-influenced Polish government  and faced repeated interrogations and professional black-listing during the early 1960s. She described post-war life in Poland in her second novel  "Quicksand" (1989).Ettinger earned a Ph.D. in American literature from Warsaw University in 1966; she moved to Cambridge the following year and served as a Senior Fellow at the Radcliffe (now Bunting) Institute until 1974. She was known for her passionate and incisive lectures on modern Russian literature  as well as her outspoken critiques of the materialism  anti-intellectualism and racial prejudice that she perceived as dominant aspects of American culture.From 1975 to 1996  Ettinger served as professor of writing at MIT  where she was named Thomas Meloy Professor of Rhetoric and Literature.  A demanding and forceful teacher  she helped build the Institute's Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies and was instrumental in bringing such writers as I. B. Singer  Bernard Malamud  and Elizabeth Bishop to the MIT community.Ettinger's biography  "Rosa Luxemburg  A Life" (1987)  was translated into several languages.  It portrays the personality--the heart and mind--of a brilliant revolutionary who was murdered by her comrades.  Love and politics are intimately interwoven throughout Ettinger's narrative.Ettinger's controversial 1994 book  "Hannah Arendt-Martin Heidegger " interpreted the lengthy romantic relationship between the Jewish philosopher and her Nazi-affiliated mentor.  In this work  described in the New York Times as "absorbing and cruelly fascinating " Ettinger was "unsparing in her exposure of both Heidegger's mendacity and Arendt's propensity for self-deception" about Heidegger  wrote the reviewer.  Shortly afterward  the Heidegger estate published the full text of the Heidegger-Arendt correspondence.Ettinger was at work on a full-length biography of Hannah Arendt at the time of her death. She is survived by her daughter  Maia Ettinger  of San Francisco.A memorial service will be held at the MIT Faculty Club on Sunday  April 10  at 11 a.m.  For further information  please call the MIT Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies at (617) 253-7894.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonMarch 16  2005 (download PDF).
Pomiecko of Comparative Media Studies dies at 48,John Christopher Pomiecko  program administrator in Comparative Media Studies  avid film buff and duplicate bridge player  died Sunday  Feb. 6  following a car accident. He was 48.Pomiecko  known as Chris  was a native of Claremont  N.H.  and a resident of Dorchester  Mass. He came to MIT in 1984 and joined the Comparative Media Studies Program (CMS) as administrator in 1999.He quickly made his mark among colleagues and students at CMS as a welcoming presence  effective organizer and steadfast supporter of the lesbian  bisexual  gay and transgendered community (LBGT). For incoming students  Pomiecko's was the face of MIT.Anita Chan  a graduate student in the Program in Science  Technology and Society and former CMS student  said  "As a new graduate student four and a half years ago  I wondered if I would ever feel at home. Chris turned the campus into a family for me. His wit and his commitment to the students was a reminder to me of the wonderful  dynamic humanity of the campus."Parmesh Shahani  a graduate student in CMS from India  recalled Pomiecko's kindness as his "first point of contact at MIT.""He helped me transition to life in the U.S. He encouraged me tremendously when I told him about the LBGT film festival I wanted to organize at MIT. Some of my best moments at MIT have been spent in his office " Shahani said.Pomiecko's colleagues noted his generosity  included sharing his interests and hobbies. He was known for enjoying restoring his Dorchester home and for the delight he took in gardening  tennis  swimming  cross-country skiing and photography. Bridge  his friends knew  was his passion. He held weekly games at his home and traveled to games around Boston and in New Hampshire.Michele Oshima  director of student and artist-in-residence programs in the Office of the Arts  took up the game thanks to Pomiecko's persistence that she learn  she said. "He was the anchor of the LBGT bridge community  a circle of funny  intelligent  competitive players " she said."Chris made me laugh and put things into perspective. I will miss his sarcasm  wit and his generosity. He was right--all work and no play is unhealthy " Oshima said.An enthusiastic and devoted uncle to his two nieces  Sophia and Natalya Martins  Pomiecko recently combined his love for them and his love for movies in a Christmas Eve outing to see the film  "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events."Pomiecko attended Middlebury College and McGill University  graduating in 1980.

Death of beloved campus night watchman brings outpouring of food and fond memories,To the thousands of MIT students who knew him  James E. Roberts Sr. was much more than the night watchman at East Campus and Senior House for the past 20 years. He was "Big Jimmy " a friend and surrogate father.Tuesday evening  Jan. 25  hundreds of students came to Senior House to pay their respects to Roberts  who died Jan. 21."Everybody knew him. There will never be another like him " said Mary Kathryn Thompson (S.B. 2002)  a graduate student who came to know Roberts through her many friends living in East Campus and Senior House. Thompson organized the Jan. 25 wake.Known for his ever-present smile and generous nature  Roberts worked hard for the students in his building. "He knew it was important to be visible around the dorm and get to know all the students. A feeling for what is going on around the place doesn't come to you  you have to go seek it out " said Senior House graduate resident tutor  Andrew Brooks.Roberts often provided pizza  ice cream  Italian ices  burritos and pot-pies for late night studiers. The food consumed during those sessions came to be affectionately known as "Jimmy food.""Jimmy had a great handle on college student food " said Geoff Goodell (S.B. 2001). Though he used much of his own money to supply the food  Roberts also provided a unique recycling service. During the day  students would leave their empty soda cans out for him to collect.  He used the return money from the cans to pay for part of the food he gave them.One student favorite was "Jimmy chili " a special chili he brought from home in a massive pot. "Some people survived on 'Jimmy Chili '" said Thompson  who arranged for the six pots of chili at Jimmy's wake. She and dozens of others spent the night before the wake baking and cooking. All told  there were 27 pans of lasagna  hundreds of cookies  and  of course  chili."It seemed to be a fitting tribute " said Media Lab graduate student Joshua Lifton who was a graduate resident tutor (GRT) at Senior House and  this week  created aweb site dedicated to Roberts."Whether you were working all night on a problem set  doing your laundry  or spray painting your latest art project  Jimmy never failed to brighten your day."The wake immediately followed Roberts' funeral  which was held at Doherty Funeral Home outside Davis Square in Somerville. Hundreds of MIT students flooded in during the visiting hours at Doherty's  where they met Roberts' family. He is survived by his mother Emily Preble of Brockton; his children  James Jr. and Kim Roberts both of Arizona; two sisters  Joann Young-Haddad of Dorchester and Jean McKenzie of Fall River; six grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.Later  the family and Roberts' best friend  Timothy Moore  and Moore's wife also came to the Senior House wake  where they took a tour and spent the evening swapping stories about the man who had such a large impact on so many students."They seemed to really appreciate getting a feel for the atmosphere Jimmy worked in and contributed so much to " said Thompson. "They knew how important we were to Jimmy and vice versa  but seeing it expressed all at once was almost overwhelming."Director of Housing Karen A. Nilsson said she was constantly impressed by Roberts' dedication to his work during a difficult shift from midnight to 8 a.m. "He always went that extra step " she said  recalling the times Roberts would take a day out of his personal vacation time to help the students in Senior House during their annual spring steer roast. "He just always gave more than 100 percent."Anonline guestbook dedicated to Robertshas garnered dozens of comments since his death  many of which have come from out-of-state alumni. Coming back to the MIT campus always meant seeing Roberts for many alumni. "His memory was incredible " said Thompson. Once students became a member of Roberts' "family " they were never forgotten."Sometimes  it seemed that Jimmy managed to remember more about my life than I did " said Goodell."For many students at MIT  studying deep into the cold and dreary nights  often alone  Jimmy's keychain and big smile at the door were a welcome sight " said Aaron Chang (S.B. 1996). "He always brought a smile to my face even when circumstances made it seem impossible."In 1991  Roberts was honored with a James N. Murphy Award  given annually to a member of the MIT community for their outstanding contributions to the MIT community. "Big Jimmy serves as protector  physician  counselor and parent to MIT students in their hours of greatest need " said the nominators. When Roberts stood to receive his award  he received a standing ovation."Jimmy was probably the best person I ever met at MIT " said Ariel Segall (S.B. 2004). "He'd keep track of the people who needed to be checked up on  and go out of his way to make sure he knew they were okay every night. He saved lives that way. Most night watchmen think their job is to guard students' bodies. Jimmy guarded our hearts  minds and souls  too."In lieu of flowers  the family requests that donations be made in Roberts' memory to the MIT Scholarship Fund (Room E19-411  77 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139).A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonFebruary 2  2005 (download PDF).

MIT Professor Ascher Shapiro  pioneer in biomedical engineering field  dies at 88,Institute Professor Emeritus Ascher Shapiro of MIT  a pioneer in the field of biomedical engineering and a leader in fluid mechanics research and education  died in his Jamaica Plain home on Nov. 26 of liver cancer. He was 88.In the early 1960s  Shapiro began studying the problems in physiology and medicine that could benefit from an engineering approach  essentially developing the burgeoning field of biomedical engineering. Virtually unheard of at the time  the field of biomedical engineering is now a major research area.Collaborating with physiologists  physicians and surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital  Beth Israel Hospital  the Harvard School of Public Health  and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary  Shapiro contributed to a number of medical advances  among them the intra-aortic balloon for patients with heart conditions  which allows doctors to use far less invasive techniques in treating cardiovascular problems. Shapiro's knowledge of fluid mechanics and engineering was instrumental in the treatment of blood clots  asthma  emphysema and glaucoma.Shapiro grew up in New York City and received the S.B. in 1938 and the Sc.D. in 1946 in mechanical engineering from MIT. During World War II  he was the director of a U.S. Navy laboratory that worked on developing turbine propulsion engines for aircraft-dropped torpedoes.Starting as a laboratory assistant at MIT in 1938  he was appointed an Instructor in 1940  promoted to assistant professor in 1943  associate professor in 1947 and professor in 1952. In 1975  he was named an Institute Professor  the highest honor awarded by the MIT faculty to a faculty member. Shapiro became chair of the MIT faculty in 1964  but resigned that post in 1965 to become head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He headed the department until 1974  when he stepped down to devote himself fully to teaching and research. Shapiro became a professor emeritus in 1986.For the first 25 years of his career  Shapiro's research was focused primarily on power production  high-speed flight  turbomachinery and propulsion by jet engines and rockets. He was a member of the Lexington Project  which helped to evaluate nuclear-powered aircraft. During that time  he invented a nuclear aircraft-propulsion system. Soon after  he directed the Atomic Energy Commission's Project Dynamo  which evaluated nuclear energy as a potential source of civilian electricity production.As a professor  Shapiro had a profound impact on his students. He was "the ultimate educator I'll ever know " wrote former student Richard Oman of Shapiro in "The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Teaching " a poem Oman wrote on the occasion of Shapiro's retirement.Shapiro's impact on fluid mechanics and engineering education was worldwide. In the early 1960s  he produced a series of 25 films on fluid dynamics  a number of which he wrote and appeared in. Those films have been watched in university classrooms around the world. Now digitized and remastered  the lecture series is still in wide use today."Producing those films was one of the joys of his life " said longtime friend and colleague  Ronald Probstein  the Ford Professor of Engineering Emeritus in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering.Shapiro made many educational contributions to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology as a member of the board of governors  a position he held from 1968 to 1989. He held 13 patents  published 130 technical articles and wrote several books. His two-volume treatise  "The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow " was published in 1953 and 1954. The first volume is still in print today and has been translated into several languages.Shapiro was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952  the National Academy of Sciences in 1967  and the National Academy of Engineering in 1974."He was a very good-humored individual " said Probstein. "He could often be seen in the society pages. He was really at the center of Boston life outside of academia." An avid tennis and squash player  Shapiro also enjoyed dancing and sailing."MIT was central to his life " said Shapiro's daughter  Martha Margowsky  of Los Angeles. Additionally  he enjoyed a close relationship with his two grandchildren  Margowsky said. Shapiro and grandson  Jonathan Barlev  now 25  had similar interests and often shared books. His grandaughter Valery Handel  15  plays the silver flute her grandfather bought for himself more than 65 years ago.Shapiro is survived by his third wife  Kathleen  of Jamaica Plain; his daughters  Margowsky and Mary Handel of Jerusalem  and his son  Peter of Morgantown  W.V.  all from his first marriage to Sylvia Charm; his two grandchildren  both of Jerusalem; and three stepchildren in Canada--Scott Larke of Victoria  Leslie Waters of Toronto  and Jennifer Bast of Georgetown.A memorial service is being planned for next year.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech TalkonDecember 8  2004 (download PDF).

Longtime math department head Ted Martin dies at 92,Professor Emeritus William "Ted" Martin  former head of the Department of Mathematics and chair of the faculty  died May 30 at the age of 92.Under Martin's leadership from 1947-68  the math department grew from a small service department into one of the major world centers of pure and applied mathematics. During his first year as head  Martin proposed a "postdoctoral instructorship or visiting lectureship" program. This became the C.L.E. Moore Instructorship Program  which was launched in 1949 and continues to this day. It is designed to attract the most promising postdoctorates in mathematics to MIT to develop their research and teaching careers.Martin collaborated with MIT faculty members R.H. Cameron  Stefan Bergman and Norbert Wiener on analytic functions of several complex variables and on the Wiener integral or Wiener measure  which Wiener proposed in 1930. During the 1950s he wrote a series of papers with Salomon Bochner  establishing generalizations of classical results in function theory for analytic functions on complex spaces with singularities.Following his tenure as department head  Martin chaired the faculty from 1969-71 and the Education Division Steering Committee from 1972-73 (he also served as division's director from 1973-75).A gifted lecturer and teacher  Martin taught first-semester calculus for five years after his official retirement. He co-chaired the steering committee for the Cambridge Conference on School Mathematics from 1962-66.Beginning in 1961  he served as chair of the steering committee of the Education Development Center's African Mathematics Program to improve mathematical educational programs in English-speaking African nations. He visited Africa regularly over a 14-year period and was a member of numerous regional African management committees. He continued these activities after his retirement from MIT in 1976  visiting the University of Science and Technology in Ghana in 1978.Martin co-authored three influential books: "Several Complex Variables" (1948)  "Elementary Differential Equations" (1956) and "Differential Space  Quantum Systems  and Prediction" (1966). He was co-editor of "Analysis in Function Space" and "Selected Papers of Norbert Wiener " both published in 1964. He was a consulting editor for the McGraw-Hill International Series of Pure and Applied Mathematics  a co-founder of International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology  an editor of Mathematical Surveys and an editorial committee member for the AMS Bulletin.Martin was born in Arkansas in 1911  received his B.A. from the University of Arkansas in 1930  and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1931 and 1934 respectively. Following an appointment as a National Research Council Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies  Martin came to MIT as instructor in 1936 and joined the faculty in 1938. He remained at the Institute until his retirement  except for a stint as head of Syracuse University's mathematics department from 1943-46.After Martin and his wife retired to Block Island  he spearheaded an effort to have affordable housing built for year-round residents; the resulting group of four houses were designated the "William Ted Martin Housing" by the islanders and were one of the achievements of which he was most proud.Martin was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of Phi Beta Kappa  Sigma Xi  the American Mathematical Society (serving as vice president for a time) and the Mathematical Association of America.He is survived by four sons  Seelye Martin of Seattle  Jim Martin of Bloomfield Village  Mich.  William Gray Martin of Brooklyn  N.Y. and Thomas Martin of Ellsworth  Maine. He is also survived by five grandchildren  a step-grandchild and a brother  James Martin of Lindale  Texas.

George Whitehead dies at 85,George W. Whitehead Jr. of Winchester  Mass.  professor emeritus in MIT's Department of Mathematics  died on Monday  April 12 at the age of 85. He served on the MIT mathematics faculty from 1949-85.Whitehead was one of the world's leading algebriac topologist and homotopy theorists. His 1941 doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago  "Homotopy Properties of the Real Orthogonal Groups " set the tone for his research  mixing geometric and algebraic methods to obtain important results in homotopy theory (homotopy is a continuous transformation from one mapping to another in a topological space).Over the ensuing two decades  Whitehead contributed to one of the major creations of postwar mathematics: algebraic topology as it is known today. He was among the first to master the technology of spectral sequences and used it  along with Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre independently in France  to initiate a systematic calculation of the homotopy groups of spheres--still a touchstone in the subject.Whitehead's 1962 paper  "Generalized Homology Theories " established the language and basic structure underlying a great part of contemporary algebraic topology. He also authored the well-known monograph  "Recent Advances in Homotopy Theory" (1970)  and his "Elements of Homotopy Theory" (Springer-Verlag  1978)  is a masterful account of classical homotopy theory.Whitehead received a number of distinctions for his research and service. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1972 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Research Scholar from 1955-56  and a National Science Foundation Senior Fellow from 1965-66.Born in Bloomington  Ill.  on August 2  1918  Whitehead received the S.B.  S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago. He was an instructor at Purdue and Princeton from 1941-47 and a faculty member at Brown University before coming to MIT in 1949. He was named a full professor in 1957. He is survived by his wife  Kay Whitehead.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon April 28  2004.

Nutritional biologist Vernon Young dies at 66,Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry Vernon Young  who revolutionized scientific understanding of how the human body processes nutrients into protein  died March 30 of complications from renal cancer. He was 66."Our conception of how much protein people need to consume is significantly different than it was 20 years ago  largely because of Vernon Young's research " said Professor Richard Wurtman  director of MIT's Clinical Research Center.Young's main area of interest was in how the body metabolizes amino acids obtained from eating protein. "He developed and utilized highly quantitative methods for determining how much of the 22 amino acids the body needs and thus  indirectly  how much protein people really need to eat according to their age  general health and other factors " Wurtman said. "He took a field that was almost totally qualitative and made it highly quantitative."Young's research could literally be seen at breakfast tables across the world  according to his youngest son  Richard. "If you look at a cereal box and read the dietary intake  you should think of my father because he was responsible for changing that " he said. "His research had a direct impact on people's daily nutritional intake.""He had the bulk of 100 years of vitamin and food science against him and turned dogma on its head with the MIT formula he developed for the right mixture of amino acids in order to make proteins that optimize health " said Alfred Ajami  chief scientific officer for Xanthus Life Sciences of Cambridge  Mass. and a close friend of Young's who worked with him for 26 years. "He set the basis for improving health outcomes not only in developed nations  but in developing countries by changing the rule of what constitutes the necessary nutrition for growth."Young  who was born in Rhyl  Wales. began his 39-year association with MIT right after receiving his Ph.D. in 1965  becoming a full professor in 1977.Besides his MIT work  Young held lecturer and other positions at Harvard Medical School  Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Tufts University.

Institute Prof. von Hippel dies at 105; was leader in materials research,Institute Professor Emeritus Arthur Robert von Hippel  who fled to the United States from Nazi Germany and went on to become a leader in the field of materials research  died on Dec. 31  of complications from flu. He was 105 years old.His name graces the highest international honor awarded in his field. The von Hippel Award of the Materials Research Society has been presented annually since 1976; von Hippel himself was the first recipient.His son  Professor Eric von Hippel of the Sloan School of Management  said his father cross-country skied until he was 95 and continued to exercise by walking a mile a day even into his 100s."A few years ago during a hurricane  he insisted on going outside in the wind and rain " Eric von Hippel recalled. "So we went out and the trees were crashing down around us  and he thought it was terrific."Born in Rostock  Germany  on Nov. 19  1898  the elder von Hippel was trained as a physicist  earning the Ph.D. from the University of Gottingen in 1924. Before coming to the United States  he taught at the University of Istanbul and the University of Copenhagen  where he worked with Nobel laureate Niels Bohr. He was married to the former Dagmar Franck  daughter of Nobel Prize-winning physicist James Franck  for more than 40 years. Mrs. von Hippel died in 1975. The von Hippels were longtime residents of Weston  Mass.After fleeing Germany  von Hippel was invited to MIT in 1936 by Karl Taylor Compton to be what von Hippel described as the "physicist in the electrical engineering department." As an assistant professor and one of the first people to understand the molecular structure of materials  he founded the Laboratory for Insulation Research (LIR) in 1940 to study the electrical properties of materials. He became professor of astrophysics in 1947 and an Institute Professor in 1962.His lab was involved with the effort to develop radar for the Allies during World War II  in conjunction with MIT's Radiation Laboratory in Building 20. The Table of Dielectric Materials he compiled during that period remains the standard today. For this table and his work in developing the techniques and instrumentation needed to make the measurements it contains  von Hippel received the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948  the second-highest honor given a civilian in this country.When Sputnik was launched in 1957 ("the little satellite circles like an embarrassing fly over the heads of the free world " von Hippel said)  he urged researchers to develop more reliable materials. "To prevent the next war " he wrote in 1958  "we have to buy not quantity but quality and extreme reliability  and these we can do only through modern materials research."Von Hippel often treated his MIT students to one-on-one conversation over tea and cookies  sometimes in lieu of a traditional written exam. Markus Zahn  now a professor of electrical engineering at MIT who in 1969-70 took von Hippel's two-semester course "From Atoms Toward Living Systems " remembered the experience fondly when von Hippel turned 100 in 1998."As part of the course work  I used to meet weekly with von Hippel to discuss physics. His longtime secretary  Aina Sils  served cookies and tea. His lectures included many slides " Zahn recalled. "Occasionally a slide of personal history would slip in  such as a picnic scene with a dignitary such as Albert Einstein. Then Professor von Hippel would tell us some anecdote..."He was an extremely well-known professor when I was a student here. When you took his course  you took it not only for the technical knowledge he'd give you  but also for the anecdotes about the people he knew. Each day you'd go to class wondering who he'd show that day."On his father's 100th birthday  Eric von Hippel remembered how his father influenced his career choice and reminisced about his own childhood experiences at MIT."I attribute the fact that three out of five of my father's children became professors to his method of sharing his own excitement with work and life. Dad would bring me to MIT and I would run up and down the corridors with my sidekick  Zachary Wiesner. We'd stick our heads into offices and people would just invite us in " said Eric von Hippel  a member of the fifth generation of von Hippel professors.In addition to Eric  von Hippel is survived by three other sons  Peter of Eugene  Ore.  Arndt of Anchorage  Alaska  and Frank of Princeton  N.J.; a daughter  Maianna of Needham  Mass.; 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.A memorial service will be scheduled at MIT.

Holography pioneer Stephen Benton dies,Stephen A. Benton  inventor of the rainbow hologram and a pioneer in medical imaging and fine arts holography  died of brain cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital on Sunday  Nov. 9. He was 61. Benton was director of the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) and the E. Rudge ('48) and the Nancy Allen Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the Media Laboratory.President Charles M. Vest said  "Steve brought a joy and spirit of inventiveness to all that he did. He was a gifted teacher  scientist  engineer and artist who personified the best of MIT."Benton was known for his enthusiasm for all things optical--an enthusiasm  he said  that was ignited the minute he put on a pair of plastic 3-D glasses to watch the film  "The House of Wax " at age 11."There was a realism and a sense of excitement like nothing I had ever felt before. Not only was I amazed; I determined then and there to figure out how it worked " Benton once said.Benton was born in San Francisco in 1941 and grew up in Santa Barbara  Calif. He received his undergraduate degree from MIT in electrical engineering (1963) and worked with stroboscopy pioneer Professor Harold "Doc" Edgerton. During this time  Benton also worked at the Polaroid Corp.  participating in Edwin Land's vision research laboratory. Benton received the M.S. (1964) and Ph.D. (1968) from Harvard University."Steve was not only a superb scientist who led his field for decades  he was also a wonderful practical craftsman of the holographic image  and a Pied Piper for students  artists and designers who worked with advanced imaging technology. His influence on the art and design worlds has been profound and enduring " said architecture professor William J. Mitchell  who is academic head of the Program in Media Arts and Sciences.Benton had his first glimpse of a hologram in 1964. It was a "little coffee cup  but it was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. I knew my life would never be the same " he said. Holography works like photography in that it records light wave patterns on chemically sensitive film or glass. Converging direct and indirect laser beams create its exciting 3-D effect.Benton invented rainbow holography--a process that makes a hologram visible using common white light  also known in its credit card iteration as "Benton holograms."Benton returned to MIT as a visiting scientist in the Laser Research Center in 1980. He became founding head of the Spatial Imaging Group in 1982. A founding faculty member of the Media Lab in 1984  Benton delighted in both the scientific and aesthetic applications of holography. He held 14 patents in optical physics  photography and holography  and his own works in holography have been displayed at the Museum of Holography in New York.In 1985  Benton began generating synthetic holograms from 3-D digital databases  initially creating a 3-D image of a green car floating in front of the Boston skyline.He described holography as a true "intersection of art  science and technology." While he considered viewing a good hologram to be a "magical experience " the rigor and depth of his research yielded far more than visual wizardry. Holograms have been used to create three-dimensional composites of CT and MRI scans that have been very useful in medical diagnosis."As a world leader in both technology and the arts  Steve Benton epitomized the Media Lab. Rather than mere users of holography  he and his lab invented many aspects of it  including the basic science behind holographic video " said Nicholas Negroponte  chairman of the MIT Media Labs and the Jerome Wiesner Professor of Media Technology.Benton is survived by his wife  Jeanne Lamphier Benton; a daughter  Julia Benton; a son  James; and brothers Nicholas and Chris.

Franco Modigliani: 1918-2003,The MIT community is mourning the loss of Professor Franco Modigliani  a Nobel laureate who always took his work seriously but never himself.Modigliani  who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1985 for his pioneering analyses of savings and financial markets  died Sept. 25 in his sleep at his home in Cambridge. He was 85 years old.Modigliani  who was extremely proud of his MIT affiliation  wore a school tie to the press conference when he won the Nobel Prize. Later in the day  he celebrated by playing tennis with his friend and 1970 Nobel laureate  Professor Paul Samuelson."We played doubles " Samuelson recalled. "An intense tennis player  he never stopped moving. He was so intense  he once ran into a cement wall trying to get the ball."Samuelson's wish to collaborate with Modigliani came to fruition on a tennis court. "One day  between serves  he asked me what I thought of a new theory " Samuelson said. "I admitted I hadn't heard of it. He explained it. We kept playing. I responded. Our collaboration was born right there."Modigliani's final collaborator was his granddaughter Leah  a vice president with Morgan Stanley in New York.Modigliani's work in economics arose from the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. He contributed the "life-cycle hypothesis " a theory about how people save for retirement that has aided countries to formulate pension plans.The Nobel committee also commended Modigliani for his work in the late 1950s with Merton Miller  who won the Nobel Prize in 1990. The two produced essays known as the "M&M papers" which argued that corporate value depended not only on debt structure but also on investor expectations."Franco Modigliani could have been a multiple Nobel winner " Samuelson said. "When he died he was the greatest living macroeconomist. He revised Keynesian economics from its Model-T  Neanderthal  Great Depression model to its modern-day form."Samuelson noted that Wall Street is populated by numerous experts who studied with Modigliani. His students also included Nobel laureate Robert Merton  a 1997 winner."He was a great teacher  intense and colorful " Samuelson said. "MIT was lucky to have him for 40 years; he was a jewel in our crown."Modigliani was known for his work on corporate finance  capital markets  macroeconomics and econometrics. He had appointments in the Department of Economics and the Sloan School of Management.Modigliani  who joined the MIT faculty in 1962  had degrees from the University of Rome and the New School for Social Research in New York City. He taught and did research at several universities before joining the faculty at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1952.He came to MIT as a professor of economics and finance and in 1970 was named an Institute Professor  a title MIT bestows on faculty who have achieved exceptional distinction in leadership  accomplishment and service to the Institute and wider community. He became professor emeritus in 1988.Modigliani received MIT's James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award in 1985. The Modigliani Professorship of Financial Economics  an endowed chair  was established in 1995.In 2001  Modigliani wrote an autobiography  "The Adventures of an Economist."Born on June 18  1918  Modigliani was the son of a pediatrician and a volunteer social worker. Modigliani  who was Jewish  met his future wife  Serena Calabi  through his involvement with student anti-fascist activists in the early 1930s. When the Italian racial laws were passed in 1938  he joined the Calabi family in Paris  where he and Serena were married. They came to the United States in August 1939.Active and involved until the end  Modigliani enlisted fellow MIT Nobel laureates in economics Samuelson and Robert M. Solow to collaborate on a letter published in the New York Times on Sept. 23. In the letter  they chided the Anti-Defamation League for honoring Italy's prime minister  Silvio Berlusconi  who had been quoted as saying that "Mussolini did not murder anyone."Their letter said  in part: "Mussolini was responsible for the death of many political opponents  Partisans and Jews. He persecuted Jews with his racial laws and ... was responsible for the deportation of almost 7 000 Jews  who died in Nazi camps."Mr. Berlusconi has apologized to Italian Jews for his statements. This is not enough; he has not apologized to Italians generally."Modigliani was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also served as president of the Econometric Society  the American Economic Association and the American Finance Association. He was a consultant to the U.S. Treasury  the Federal Reserve System and a number of European banks.A slight  gregarious man  Modigliani enjoyed skiing  tennis and sailing. He used some of his $225 000 Nobel Prize money to upgrade his Laser-class sailboat.Besides his wife  Modigliani is survived by two sons: Andre  a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan  and Sergio  of Brookline  an architect; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Donations in Modigliani's memory may be made to the American Friends Service Committee  1501 Cherry St.  Philadelphia  PA 19102. A memorial will be scheduled.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon October 1  2003.

He was 85 years old.Modigliani and an associate  Merton Miller  concluded that the market value of a company had no genuine relationship to the size and structure of its debt. Instead  they found  stock market values are determined mainly by what enterprises are expected to earn in the future.MIT Institute Professor Paul Samuelson  a friend and fellow Nobelist  said "Franco Modigliani could have been a multiple Nobel winner.

He had appointments in MIT's Department of Economics and the Sloan School of Management."Franco was a giant among economists and played a decisive role in the intellectual development of corporate finance " said Dean Richard Schmalensee of the Sloan School."His legendary enthusiasm and intensity never flagged. He inspired generations of students and colleagues with his passion for using economics to benefit society. Everyone who knew him will miss him."Dean Philip Khoury of the MIT School of Humanities  Arts and Social Sciences said  "Franco Modigliani was an elder statesman among economists. He was always surrounded by young scholars and researchers whom he loved to engage with on the major economic and social issues of the day."Modigliani  who joined the MIT faculty in 1962  had degrees from the University of Rome and the New School for Social Research in New York City. He taught and did research at several universities before joining the faculty at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1952. He came to MIT 10 years later as a professor of economics and finance and in 1970 was named an Institute Professor  an appointment MIT reserves for scholars of distinction.

MIT Prof. Norman Rasmussen dies at 75; Applied risk assessment to nuclear power,MIT Professor Emeritus Norman C. Rasmussen  who made pioneering contributions to the field of nuclear energy risk assessment  died July 18 in the Rivercrest Nursing Home in Concord  Mass. of complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 75.As author of the 1975 Reactor Safety Study  which studied the public risk of nuclear power plant accidents  Rasmussen made history by applying the probabilistic approach to risk assessment to the nuclear industry for the first time. Prepared for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  the report received worldwide attention and later came to be called the Rasmussen Report. It became one of the most influential elements in nuclear safety and licensing internationally. The probabilistic risk assessment methods introduced by that report are used routinely today in nuclear power plant safety assessment and in other industries.But at that time the report was not without detractors. While proponents of nuclear energy cited it as proof that the risk of a nuclear power plant failure was low  opponents of nuclear power criticized the methodology behind the risk assessment and faulted its conclusions. It was not unusual during the 1970s for Rasmussen to participate in debates over the safety of nuclear power with other MIT faculty members  including the late Henry Kendall of physics  who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1990. Rasmussen also made his case regarding the safety of nuclear power in a televised debate with Ralph Nader.Rasmussen was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award in 1985  one of the oldest and most prestigious science and technology awards given by the United States government. The award cited his "pioneering contributions to nuclear energy in the development of probabilistic risk assessment techniques that have provided new insights and led to new developments in nuclear power plant safety."Rasmussen was a professor of nuclear engineering at MIT from 1958-94  and was head of MIT's Department of Nuclear Engineering from 1975-81. His classes earned excellent student reviews and he received a School of Engineering Spira Award for teaching in 1992. The Department later endowed a faculty chair in his name. He is co-author of the textbook "Modern Physics for Engineers."Rasmussen was a consultant to industry and adviser to the U.S. government  and was appointed by President Reagan in 1982 to a six-year term on the National Science Board. He received both the Distinguished Service Award from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Distinguished Achievement Award of the Health Physics Society in 1976.He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1977 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979  was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management and a fellow of the American Nuclear Society. He received honorary doctorates from Gettysburg College and the Catholic University of Leuven.Born in Harrisburg  Pa.  on Nov. 12  1927  Rasmussen graduated from high school in Gettysburg  and served in the U.S. Navy from June 1945 to August 1946. He earned the B.A. cum laude in 1950 from Gettysburg College and the Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1956.He married Thalia Tichenor in 1952 and the couple lived in Sudbury  where they raised a son and daughter. Rasmussen was a woodworker and an avid bird-watcher who loved to spend family time at the summer cottage he built himself on Sand Pond in Marlow  N.H.Rasmussen is survived by a son  Neil E. (a 1976 graduate of MIT)  and his wife  Anna  of Concord; a daughter  Arlene R. Soule  and her husband  Jeffrey  of Littleton  N.H.; five brothers and four grandchildren. Mrs. Rasmussen died in 1999.Burial will be private. A memorial service will be scheduled in September. Contributions in Rasmussen's memory may be made to the American Parkinson's Disease Association  Massachusetts Chapter  720 Harrison Ave.  Suite 707  Boston  MA 02118.Visiting hours are Friday  July 25 from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Joseph Dee & Son Funeral Home in Concord.
Retired MIT professor Imre Halasz  renowned architect and urban planner  dies at 77,Imre Halasz  an internationally renowned architect  urban planner and teacher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  died on July 3 at his home in Boston after a long illness. He was 77.Revered worldwide as a teacher  Halasz taught at universities in the United States and Canada as well as Kyoto  Florence  Haifa and Santiago. He was also a practicing architect in partnership with his brother  Anthony. Their projects included the feasibility and development plan for the NASA Electronics Research Center in Cambridge  Mass. (1968)  the Don Bosco Technical High School in Boston (1971)  a land reclamation project and urban development plan for Corinto  Nicaragua (1977) and a reconstruction plan for the historic district of Santiago (1978-79). The pair won several competition prizes as well.Halasz was born in Budapest  Hungary and studied at the College of Fine and Applied Art and the Technical University (both in Budapest)  receiving his diploma in 1950. After postgraduate work at the Acadï¿½mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the University of Leiden in Holland  he taught architectural design at the Polytechnic University of Budapest until 1956.Halasz was on the architecture faculty at MIT from 1957-63 and from 1969 until his retirement in 1991. In the interim  he taught and advised in Chile  Peru and Brazil and was a visiting professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design from 1966-68. After retiring from MIT as a full-time professor  he held the post of senior lecturer until his death.In 2002  a comprehensive book on the Halasz brothers' design accomplishments was published in the Hungarian Monograph Series  sponsored by the Hungarian Art Museum of Budapest and the Hungarian Foundation for the Advancement of Architecture. This series acknowledges the achievements of notable Hungarian architects who live and work outside their homeland.Halasz received a Golden Diploma from the Technical University of Budapest in 2000. Two years later  he was elected a Fellow of the College of the American Institute of Architecture. He was a longtime member of the American Institute of Architects  the Boston Society of Architects and the Architectural Association in London. He was an honorary member of the faculty at the Catholic University of Chile and the Chilean Society of Architects.Halasz is survived by his brother Anthony. At Halasz' request  no funeral service is scheduled  though a memorial service sponsored by the architecture department will be held at the MIT Chapel on Sept. 18  2003 at 11 a.m. Donations in his memory may be made to a fund he established at MIT to award an annual prize for the most outstanding master of architecture thesis.

MIT Professor Kindleberger dies at 92,Charles P. Kindleberger  an economic historian and authority on international monetary affairs who was a leading architect of the Marshall Plan after World War II  died on Monday  July 7 of a stroke at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge. He was 92.Kindleberger  who lived in Lexington  was the Ford International Professor of Economics Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He retired in 1976 after 33 years of teaching  writing and research at MIT. His career included appointments at universities throughout the world as well as government service and financial industry leadership.Kindleberger described his around-the-clock work to develop and launch the Marshall Plan  also known as the European Recovery Program  with singular passion in a 1973 interview."We were conscious of a great sense of excitement about the plan. Marshall himself was a great  great man -- funny  odd but great -- Olympian in his moral quality. We'd stay up all night  night after night. The first work ever done that I know about in economics on computers used the Pentagon's computers at night for the Marshall Plan. I had a tremendous sense of gratification from working so hard on it " Kindleberger said.Born in New York City on Oct. 12  1910  Professor Kindleberger graduated from the Kent School in 1928 and the University of Pennsylvania in 1932. He received an A.M. degree in 1934 and a Ph.D. in 1937 from Columbia University.During World War II  Kindleberger served in the Office of Strategic Services in Washington and London until he became a major in the 12th Army Group in Europe. After the war  he served as chief of the Division of German and Austrian Economic Affairs and as chief of the committee that prepared cost estimates for the European Recovery Program. He was a key advisor on German reparations.Kindleberger came to MIT in 1948 as an associate professor of economics  becoming a full professor in 1951 and later the Ford International Professor of Economics. Following his retirement in 1976  he continued as a senior lecturer until 1981.Kindleberger was a member of former President Lyndon B. Johnson's Committee on International Monetary Arrangements. While on leave in 1967-68  he assisted five black colleges in Atlanta  Ga.  in teaching and helping develop economics programs and course offerings. He became a trustee of Clark College in Atlanta and a member of the United Negro College Fund.He served as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and held similar positions with the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He was president of the American Economic Association in 1985.Prolific authorKindleberger wrote 30 books  one before World War II and the other 29 beginning in 1950. His initial research focused on foreign exchange -- an early work  "International Economics " went through five editions during its 25 years of use as a standard economics textbook.Gradually  his focus widened to international trade  multinational corporations  and economic and financial history.In history  Kindleberger's best-known works are "The World in Depression  1929-1939" (1971); "Manias  Panics and Crashes" (1978)  with new editions in 1989 and 1996; "A Financial History of Western Europe" (1984  with a second edition in 1993).His most recent substantial monographs were "Centralization vs. Pluralism " and "World Economic Primacy  1500-1990 " both published in 1996.Kindleberger had honorary degrees from the Universities of Paris  Ghent and Pennsylvania.

Institute Professor Hermann Haus  quantum optics pioneer  dies at 77,Institute Professor Hermann Anton Haus  one of the world's leading authorities on optical communications  died on May 21. He suffered a heart attack after arriving home in Lexington from his regular 15-mile commute by bicycle from MIT. He was 77 years old."Hermann Haus was one of the great scientist-engineers who helped to define MIT " President Charles M. Vest said. "His pathbreaking work in quantum optics spanned from basic physics to engineering systems. He was a warm and inspiring teacher and colleague."Haus was born in Ljubljana  Slovenia  in the former Yugoslavia. When Tito's Communist-backed forces expelled the German-speaking population shortly after the end of World War II  he and his mother were shipped to Austria with other refugees. He came to America in 1948 and earned a B.S. from Union College in 1949 and an M.S. in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1951.Haus received the Sc.D. from MIT in 1954  the same year he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He became an associate professor in 1958 and full professor in 1962.

MIT Professor Hermann Haus dies at 77; Was pioneer in optical communications,Hermann Anton Haus  an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the world's leading authorities on optical communications  died Wednesday night  May 21.Haus suffered a heart attack after arriving home in Lexington from his regular  15-mile commute by bicycle from MIT in Cambridge. He was 77 years old.Haus led research and taught at MIT for nearly a half-century  and inspired generations of new thinkers in a field that led to successive revolutions in communications. He received the National Medal of Science from President Clinton in 1995 for his research and his teaching  and was one of the few engineers in the country to become a member of both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences."Hermann Haus was one of the great scientist-engineers who helped to define MIT " MIT President Charles M. Vest said. "His pathbreaking work in quantum optics spanned from basic physics to engineering systems. He was a warm and inspiring teacher and colleague."Haus was born in Ljubljana  Slovenia  in the former Yugoslavia  on Aug. 8  1925. His mother was Helene Hynek. His father  Otto Maximilian  was a doctor and tuberculosis specialist. Haus' grandfather  Anton von Haus  was the commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian naval fleet under Emperor Franz Joseph during World War I.Haus studied Latin and Greek at the Classic Gymnasium in Ljubljana as well as French and Serbian  but his Austrian family spoke German at home. When Tito's Communist-backed forces expelled the German-speaking population shortly after the end of World War II  Haus and his mother were taken from their home in the middle of the night of Dec. 17  1945  and shipped by rail to Austria with other refugees.The experience of the Communist takeover of Slovenia left Haus with two formative experiences. Conscripted to work in a factory as a machinist while still in his teens  he became fascinated with electricity and its properties  which eventually led to his career in electrical engineering. He would later recall that he met a chemist on the refugee train who had lost a lifetime's worth of notes. At that point he said he realized that "all that you can ever take with you are the equations that you have in your head " inspiring his love for the elegant simplicity of quantum mechanics.Once relocated in Austria  Haus studied at the Technical University of Graz and the University of Vienna. Knowing that opportunities were limited  he wrote a letter to General Mark Clark  who had been the post-war commander of U.S. forces in Austria  seeking to study in the U.S. He came to the U.S. in 1948  and earned his B.S. from Union College in 1949 and the M.S. in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1951.Haus received the Sc.D. from MIT in 1954  the same year he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He became an associate professor in 1958 and a full professor in 1962. He was named an Institute Professor in 1986.Haus' research and teaching ranged from fundamental investigations of quantum uncertainty as manifested in optical communications to the practical generation of ultra-short optical pulses (100 000 times shorter than a billionth of a second). Ultra-short laser pulses find applications in eye surgery  medical imaging and precision clocks  as well as in ultrafast instrumentation and fiber-optic communications. In 1994  the Optical Society of America recognized Dr. Haus' contributions with its Frederic Ives Medal  the society's highest award.The fiber-optic undersea cables that provide rapid voice and data communications among the United States  Europe and Asia are the result of the pioneering investigations of Haus and fellow researchers at AT&T Bell Laboratories and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Research Laboratories. They helped develop "soliton" methods of transmission that have created new possibilities for transmitting voice and data signals across an ocean without distortion.Haus authored or co-authored five books and published nearly 300 articles and presented his work at virtually every major conference and symposium on laser and quantum electronics and quantum optics around the world.He was a visiting professor or consultant at a number of corporations  universities and laboratories  including Raytheon Corp.  Lawrence Livermore Laboratory  Cambridge University  AT&T Bell Laboratories  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Research Laboratories  Bell Communications Laboratories  Technische Universitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t in Vienna  Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley.He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Physical Society  the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  and the Optical Society of America. He received Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships and several honorary doctorate degrees  including an honorary degree from the University of Vienna  and the Austrian government's Wittgenstein Prize  awarded for outstanding contributions to humanity. He was selected by his MIT colleagues for the 1982-83 James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award  one of the highest honors that the MIT faculty bestows.Haus is survived by his wife of 50 years  Eleanor (Laggis); four children and their spouses--William Haus and his wife Patti  of Maui  Hawaii; Stephen  of Honolulu  Hawaii; Cristina Haus and Paolo Alimonti  of Irvington  N.Y.; Mary Haus and Willard Holmes of New York City--four grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. on Tuesday  May 27  at the Church of Our Redeemer  6 Meriam St.  Lexington. A wake will be held the night before at Douglass Funeral Home  51 Worthen Road  Lexington  from 5 to 7 p.m.In lieu of flowers  donations may be made to MIT  Hermann Haus Fund  77 Massachusetts Avenue  Cambridge  MA 02139-4307  or the Church of Our Redeemer.

Philanthropist Cecil Green dies at 102,Cecil H. Green (S.B. and S.M. 1924)  a worldwide philanthropist whose family name graces the tallest building on the MIT campus as well as a women's residence hall and nine endowed professorships  died on April 11 of complications from pneumonia at the age of 102.He died at his residence in a hospital he endowed  the Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla  Calif.Green and his late wife  Ida  over four decades donated $31 752 759 to MIT  equal to more than $91 million in today's dollars. The New York Times obituary reported that their philanthropy totaled $200 million.MIT President Charles M. Vest commented  "Cecil and Ida Green were two of the most extraordinary philanthropists in the world. They created facilities and endowed programs in education  science  medicine  social services and the arts at universities and medical centers throughout this country  England  Canada and Chile. Their contributions to MIT were vitally important in many fields. They were especially supportive of women graduate students and faculty."There are buildings named after the Greens at MIT  the University of British Columbia  Stanford  Scripps Health Center in La Jolla  University of California at San Diego  the Colorado School of Mines  the University of Texas Dallas  Southwest Medical Center  Baylor University  the National Research Council in Washington  D.C.  and at the Magellan Telescope in Chile. In England  Green's philanthropy was responsible for the establishment of Green College at Oxford University.At MIT  the Greens provided major funding for the 295-foot-tall Cecil H. and Ida F. Green Center for Earth Sciences  designed by I.M. Pei  and the Ida Flansburgh Green Hall for graduate women. A major renovation in the department of physics will be named The Cecil H. and Ida F. Green Center for Physics.The Greens endowed six full MIT professorships--two in physics  two in earth  atmospheric and planetary sciences (EAPS)  one in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)  and one in education. In addition  junior faculty members are appointed to three career development chairs (one in EAPS and two Institute-wide) for three-year terms.David Pritchard and Jeffrey Goldstone currently hold the physics chairs while Bradford Hager and Carl Wunsch have the EAPS appointments. Funds for the education chair  held by Margaret MacVicar at the time of her death  have been used to support the MacVicar Faculty Fellowship program.Green co-founded Texas Instruments  Inc. in 1951 and amassed a fortune by the time he retired in 1975. After that  he devoted his life to giving away the fortune."The idea is to get down to my last nickel before I die " he said in the 1990s. Their list of contributions requires 18 pages in "Cecil and Ida Green  Philanthropists Extraordinary " the 1989 biography written by their good friend Robert R. Shrock  the late MIT professor of geology.The Green Building was dedicated on Oct. 2  1964. Eugene McDermott  one of the original partners in Texas Instruments  commissioned his Stevens Tech classmate  Alexander Calder  to create "The Big Sail " a sculpture that faces the Green Building on McDermott Court. McDermott was a longtime member of the MIT Corporation.Born in Manchester  England  on Aug. 6  1900  Green moved to Canada as an infant and on to San Francisco in 1905  where his father was a cable car operator. Shortly after the 1906 earthquake  the family moved to Vancouver  B.C.  where Green  an only child  grew up.He attended the University of British Columbia before going to MIT. At MIT he received the S.B. and S.M. in electrical engineering  and is listed as a member of the Class of 1923. Green sold neon lighting  automobiles and insurance before he began his engineering career in 1924 at General Electric in Schenectady  N.Y.  where he met Ida Mabelle Flansburgh. They were married two years later.Green traveled to Saudi Arabia in 1930 with an oil exploration crew for Geophysical Services in Dallas  a pioneer in digital analysis of seismic records. With three partners  Green bought the company on Dec. 6  1941  the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Geophysical Services  which made submarine detection devices and radar during World War II  became Texas Instruments in 1951. The next year  it entered the semiconductor business and produced the first pocket-sized transistor radio in 1954. Green was president of Texas Instruments from 1951 to 1955.Aside from philanthropy  the Greens' passion was travel. They visited the Middle East  Central and South America  Hong Kong and Europe together. After Mrs. Green died in 1986  he traveled alone to Australia  Saudi Arabia  South Africa and China. The Greens had no children and there are no survivors.Green was elected to the MIT Corporation in 1958 and became a life member in 1975.In 1990  Green became the first American citizen to be named an honorary member of the Chinese Geophysical Society by the Republic of China. The next year  Queen Elizabeth II made him Sir Cecil Green as an honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.A memorial service was held April 17 at St. James-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in La Jolla. Burial was private.

Gene Larrabee  'Mr. Propeller' of human-powered flight  dies at 82,Professor E. Eugene Larrabee of aeronautics and astronautics  known as "Mr. Propeller" in the human-powered aircraft community  died on Jan. 11 in Mt. Vernon  N.Y. He was 82.Larrabee specialized in propeller and windmill design and made key original contributions to the science and technology of aircraft and road vehicles. His propeller designs achieved international recognition with the flights of the human-powered aircraft Chrysalis  built and flown at MIT in 1978-79; the Gossamer Albatross  which crossed the English Channel in 1979  and the Daedalus  which crossed the Aegean Sea in 1988.Recalling the flight of the Albatross  David Gordon Wilson  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering  recalled  "The Albatross' pilot could stay aloft only 10 minutes at first. With the MIT propeller  he stayed up for over an hour on his first flight and had to be called down because his ground crew--bicycling beneath the plane--was tired out. Thus there was no way the Albatross could cross the Channel  which took almost three hours  without the MIT propeller."Larrabee began teaching at MIT in 1946 while still a graduate student  and received the S.M. in aeronautics in 1948. He retired in 1982. A founding member of the Tech Model Aircrafters  he was a popular and accessible figure among students  colleagues and hobbyists who shared his enthusiasm for flight."His design methods could be easily performed with a hand calculator or a spreadsheet. They were even usable by lay engineers with no specialization in aerodynamics  which made them very popular with aircraft and boat homebuilders  hobbyists  and wind power manufacturers  in addition to their expected use by the light aircraft industry " said Mark Drela  professor of aeronautics and astronautics and a former student of Larrabee's.As for Larrabee's personal style  Drela recalled his "tendency to interject an amusing and relevant historical aviation anecdote into almost any conversation."Larrabee married the former Christine Rogan in 1950; they were introduced by an MIT student  she recalled.Larrabee kept in contact with his former students  and "many of them called to request his course notes to use in their own work " Mrs. Larrabee said.She remembered one design session  fueled by doughnuts and cider. "It was before the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. Gene and his students sat around my dining room table and designed a car to go 100 miles an hour. It was a company car  for trips too short to take out an airplane. Later a major car maker used their ideas. He was always looking ahead " she said.Larrabee was also known for his designs for research apparatus  having contributed to the designs of the Student Wind Tunnel used at MIT from 1947-61  an innovative wall balance for testing small automobile models  and a research windmill.Born in Marlborough  in 1920  Larrabee received the B.S. in mechanical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1942.

Backer  leader in fiber and polymer research  dies,Professor Emeritus Stanley Backer  an international leader in the field of fiber and polymer research  died at home in Waban on Jan. 18 of kidney failure. He was 82.Professor Backer was head of the Fibers and Polymers Laboratory of MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering from 1962-89. His approach to textile engineering combined an understanding of the physical properties of individual fibers with an analysis of the structural geometry of the fibers within fabric  allowing the prediction of fabric behavior based on the properties of the component yarns. His studies had application not only to the design of new types of fabrics  but also to the use of fiber reinforcement of nonfibrous material such as cements  and to the behavior of fibers in marine rope.In addition to his work on textile mechanics  Professor Backer led a pioneering program to set up an online computer retrieval system for textile information in the mid-1960s. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce  the program was designed to provide an effective language interface between people and manual storage systems and the immense data handling capacity of computers. The Textile Information Retrieval Project produced a comprehensive thesaurus of textile terms  comprising 8 000 keywords and 72 000 related terms  which was translated into seven languages. The system was one of the first functional online information retrieval systems  allowing simultaneous access to a database of textile information by up to 25 separate users on two continents.Professor Backer earned the S.B. in engineering and manufacturing in 1941 from MIT. He then joined the Army  where he did research for the U.S. Quartermaster. In 1944 he completed his service as a major and continued work for the Quartermaster as a civilian  organizing and heading the Quartermaster's Textile Engineering Laboratory in Philadelphia.He returned to MIT to complete his S.M. in textile technology in 1948 and his Sc.D. in mechanical engineering in 1953. He was appointed to the MIT faculty in 1951 as an assistant professor and in 1962 was promoted to full professor and head of the Fibers and Polymers Laboratory. He retired in 1989  at which time he took the title of professor emeritus. He continued to teach  supervise graduate students and write; he completed his last book  a history of textile engineering at the Institute titled "100 Years of Textiles at MIT " in 2002.Professor Backer trained a generation of textile scientists who have gone on to leadership positions in industry  government and academia. Professor Nam Suh  former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering  said of Professor Backer: "Stanley was a gentle soul  a teacher among teachers. He collaborated with a number of people and had a very positive impact on the department. He was always very calm and supportive  and very dedicated to his students."Professor Backer was born in Boston on Feb. 9  1920. He graduated from Boston Latin School in 1937 and married Esther Ross in 1949. Professor and Mrs. Backer have lived in Waban for 47 years  where they raised two sons.In addition to his wife  Professor Backer is survived by his sons  Richard of Berkeley  Calif.  and Jonathan and his wife Amy of New Rochelle  N.Y.  and three grandsons.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 29  2003.

Professor Reginald Newell dies at 71; studied climate system  air pollution,MIT Professor Reginald E. Newell of Arlington  a meteorologist whose research concentrated on global air pollution and on the energy  momentum and mass balances of the climate system  died Sunday  Dec. 29  at Massachusetts General Hospital of a massive stroke.Professor Newell  71  earned his B.Sc. in 1954 from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom  where he was born and raised. Upon graduation  he came to MIT as a research assistant in meteorology and received the S.M. (1956) and Sc.D. (1960).He was an assistant professor in the Department of Earth  Atmosphere and Planetary Sciences from 1961 to 1966 and an associate professor from 1966 to 1969  when he became a full professor. Professor Newell taught courses on the physics of the upper atmosphere  on past and present climate  and on global air pollution.In 1970  he turned his attention to climate problems and worked on factors controlling mass climatic fluctuations for the previous 40 years  as well as on the physics of the ice ages. He also began work on the effects of changing carbon dioxide concentrations on atmospheric heating rates and on the global circulation of carbon monoxide. When it became clear that climatic fluctuations were closely related to sea surface temperature (SST)  he began studies of global SST patterns.In 1969  he warned a Massachusetts legislative committee that Boston would develop serious smog problems similar to Los Angeles if automobile traffic were not curtailed. Three years later  he suggested that a harbor tunnel be constructed for rail traffic from Logan Airport to New York on trains that traveled at 100-120 miles per hour.During the 1980s and 1990s  he participated in NASA Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange Program experiments over Australia  investigating how the circulation in that region interacts with the ocean and carries air from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Professor Newell acted as a mission meteorologist for the NASA DC-8 Pacific Exploratory Missions to the west Pacific in 1991 and 1994 and flew again with NASA to the tropical Pacific in 1996. He was involved in another joint international aircraft experiment in 1997.Professor Newell was a member of the Measure of Air Pollution by Satellites (MAPS) team that measured carbon monoxide from space. He also participated in two 1994 space shuttle experiments that showed the relationship between column carbon monoxide measured in the shuttle and surface layer convergence patterns.Professor Newell served as president of the International Association for Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics (IAMAP) International Commission on Climate from1977 to 1983 and was a member of the IAMAP Commissions on Meteorology of the Upper Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution from 1971 to 1983. His honors include the 1985 Alexander Von Humboldt Award and the Japan International Science and Technology Agency Fellowship in 1990.He is survived by his wife of 48 years  Maireen W. (Lees); two daughters  Madeleine Newell of Arlington and Elizabeth Parker of Lexington; two sons  Oliver of Billerica and Nicholas of Reading; and two grandchildren.A memorial service is scheduled for Thursday  Jan. 23  at 5:30 p.m. in the MIT Chapel. Following the service  EAPS will host a reception in the Ida M. Green Lounge  Room 54-923.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 8  2003.

Walter Milne  Cambridge ambassador and aide to six MIT presidents  dies at 80,Walter L. Milne  80  who played a key role over four decades as an aide to six MIT presidents and helped develop many Cambridge institutions as MIT's liaison to the city  died at his Cambridge home on Dec. 23 of complications from Alzheimer's disease.A memorial service will be held at MIT at a date to be arranged.Milne served from 1951-91 in the MIT presidential administrations of the late James R. Killian Jr.  the late Julius A. Stratton  Howard W. Johnson  the late Jerome B. Wiesner  Paul E. Gray and Charles M. Vest. He also served under four chairmen: Killian  Johnson  David S. Saxon and Gray.Killian devoted a page in his 1985 memoirs  "The Education of a College President " to "Walter L. Milne: Ambassador to Cambridge."Killian wrote  "In Great Britain his title would be private secretary to the prime minister; at MIT we call him assistant to the chairman and the president. Given the range of his duties external to the Institute  he might be dubbed foreign minister since he has been the principal officer at MIT who represents it in its relations with the city of Cambridge."After having served as assistant to Jim Rowlands  director of the News Office  and then to Francis Wylie  director of public relations  he joined the presidential staff in 1958  during the period I was in Washington [as science advisor to President Eisenhower]  and there provided my successor  President Stratton  with valuable continuity. Later during my chairmanship  when I began to give special attention to MIT's Cambridge relationships  he carried on the work [with the city]."It was soon recognized within and without the Institute that he had special gifts for the cultivation of amiable town-and-gown relationships.  His diplomacy in handling affairs led me to conclude that MIT had the best civic relations of any institution in the city."Beyond these more formal responsibilities  he had qualities that led officers of the Institute to turn to him for counsel and advice on many matters " Killian wrote.Milne leaves his wife Ruth. Also surviving are three children from his marriage with the late Ida Norton: Richard of Lexington  Nancy Savioli of Arlington  and Peter of Somerville; eight grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; a half-brother  Malcolm Salter; and two stepsons  Barry and Bruce Boyce.Contributions may be made in his name to the VNA Hospice  186 Alewife Brook Parkway  Cambridge  MA 02138  or to the Salvation Army Cambridge Corps  P.O.

Walter Milne dies at 80; aide to 6 MIT presidents  helped develop Cambridge institutions,A private service was held Friday  Dec. 27 for Walter L. Milne  who played    a key role over four decades at MIT as an aide to six presidents and helped    develop many Cambridge institutions as MIT's liaison to the city. Milne  80     died at his Cambridge home on Dec. 23 of complications from Alzheimer's disease.He served from 1951 to 1991 in the MIT presidential administrations of the late    James R. Killian Jr.  the late Julius A. Stratton  Howard W. Johnson  the late    Jerome B. Wiesner  Paul E. Gray and Charles M. Vest.Killian  in his memoirs  praised Milne as "a trusted counselor" and    "MIT's ambassador to Cambridge." Milne for many years had the unusual    title of assistant to the chairman and to the president. He served under four    chairmen: Killian  Johnson  David S. Saxon and Gray.He was born in Fall River on Apr. 14  1922. After graduating from Durfee High    School there  he went to Brown University where he got a BA in English in 1943.During World War II  he served in the Navy as a lieutenant j.g  from 1943 to    1946. He taught English at Veterans Regional High School in Fall River while    studying for his master's degree  which he received from Brown in 1947. He taught    English for two years at Brown and two years at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.He joined MIT in 1951as an editorial assistant to the News Service and the Educational    Council. He moved to Arlington  Mass. with his wife  Ida (Norton)  whom he married    in 1943. She died in 1978.Milne's first MIT promotion was to administrative assistant to the News Service    and President Killian in 1953. He also was the MIT science reporter on WGBH-TV    in its early days and served as assistant director of public relations in the    late 1950s.In 1958  after Killian went to Washington to be President Eisenhower's national    science advisor  Stratton  the acting president  named Milne as his assistant.    Milne became assistant to the chairman when Killian became chairman in 1959."I worked with him for 17 years  from 1966 to 1971 as president and 1971    to 1983 as chairman " said Johnson. "Walter was a man who knew Cambridge     its leaders and people " said Johnson. "He knew our institution well.    He was a good man and an honest man."Johnson said that Milne played a key role in MIT's construction of 700 "turnkey"    elderly housing units on three sites for Cambridge  the largest such program    in the nation in the late 1960s. In 1972  President Wiesner gave him the additional    title of special assistant to the president for urban relations.Milne was deeply involved in the planning of the Cambridge Center complex in    Kendall Square. He raised funds and served on the board for many human service    organizations in Cambridge.Robert Healy  Cambridge city manager since 1982  said in a statement  "I    considered Walter to be extremely well-informed and articulate  and very helpful    in our mutual efforts to make this a better community. Walter's help was extremely    appreciated in handling issues around CASPAR (the Cambridge and Somerville Project    for Alcohol Rehabilitation) and in the planning and creation of the Citywide    Senior Center opposite City Hall  where he was instrumental in raising funds    for a variety of needs."In 1998  the city dedicated the ballroom in the Senior Center to Milne  who    was board chairman of the Friends of the Council on Aging (COA). The COA newsletter    said  "Walter's magnanimous spirit was infectious  encouraging business    owners and other community leaders to join with hundreds of individuals to become    financial donors to this center."Gray  president from 1980 to 1990  said  "I benefited  beyond my capacity    to acknowledge  from Walter's intimate knowledge of the processes of government    on Capitol Hill  on Beacon Hill  and in our City Hall. The Institute has been    enriched by his judgment and wisdom."Milne also served as staff to the selection committees that chose three presidents--Wiesner     Gray and Vest-- and two chairmen of the corporation  David S. Saxon and the    current chairman  Alexander V. D'Arbeloff.Vest  president since 1990  commented  "I have fond memories of Walter    Milne  who played a major role in effecting my transition to the MIT presidency.    Becky  our children and I remember his warmth  attention to detail and personal    friendship through that happy but complicated period of our lives. He was a    friend and supporter of the entire MIT community and we all will miss him. Walter    also was a tutor to me and to all our government and community relations officers.    He was known for having set a high standard of integrity and principle in all    of MIT's Washington dealings."Milne moved to Cambridge in 1979 upon his marriage to Ruth Clark of Haverhill.His Cambridge activities for MIT included devoted service to the Salvation    Army and to the Boy Scouts. He had been an Eagle Scout as a youth and years    later was given Scouting's highest award in recognition of his service as commissioner    of the Boston area Minuteman Council.He founded the Cambridge Partnership for Public Education  the Skills Bank    of the Boston Urban Foundation  and the MIT Community Service Fund  which provides    volunteer services in Cambridge. He also helped establish the Neighborhood Family    Care Center.He served a term as head of the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce  president of    the Cambridge Rotary Club and president of the East End Union.He served on the boards of the Cambridge Model Cities Program  Just-A-Start    Corporation  the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee  Reliance Cooperative    Bank  Cambridgeport Savings Banks  and two organizations promoting housing     the Cambridge Corporation and the Northgate Community Corporation. The Cambridge    Corporation built hundreds of affordable housing units in the city.He leaves his wife Ruth and his three children  Richard  of Lexington  Mass.

Francis Hildebrand of math dies at 87,Professor Emeritus of Mathematics Francis B. Hildebrand of Wellesley  who was an MIT faculty member for 44 years  died on Nov. 29 at the age of 87.Professor Hildebrand was also an MIT alumnus  having earned the Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1940. He was appointed to the faculty the same year and retired in 1984.When Professor Hildebrand joined the faculty  engineering and computational    fields were increasingly in need of a standardized mathematics curriculum tailored    to their studies  so he developed his famous courses on advanced calculus for    engineers. The courses resulted in a textbook "Advanced Calculus for Engineers "    which became the standard reference for engineering mathematics.In 1952  Professor Hildebrand wrote "Methods in Applied Mathematics " another    influential teaching and reference text. In 1956 he published "Introduction    to Numerical Analysis " which contained techniques he himself developed. The    book played a role in positioning numerical analysis as a major influence during    an early stage of computer design. As a researcher  Professor Hildebrand contributed    to the studies of numerical solution of integral equations and the theory of    elasticity. During World War II  he worked for two years in the Radiation Laboratory."Francis Hildebrand is one of the most modest and self-effacing individuals I know " Professor Daniel Kleitman said at Professor Hildebrand's retirement dinner.Professor Hildebrand received an honorary doctorate from Washington and Jefferson College in 1969. He was a member of the American Mathematics Society  Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Delta Theta. In addition to his academic life  he was an accomplished jazz musician and a student of early photography.Professor Hildebrand received the B.S. and A.M. from Washington and Jefferson    College in 1936 and 1938  respectively.

Deutsch  discoverer of positronium  dies at 85,Martin Deutsch  a Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist from Vienna    who fled fascism  worked on the Manhattan Project and later discovered an elemental    form of matter  died Aug. 16 at his home in Cambridge  Mass.  at the age of    85.The crowning achievement of Deutsch's career came in 1951 at age 34  when    he measured and confirmed the existence of positronium.Positronium is a hydrogen-like atom without a nucleus. Its life exists entirely    in a "dance of death" that lasts for as little as 1/10 of a billionth    of a second. The properties of positronium corroborated the quantum theory of    electrodynamics for a two-particle system.Deutsch was born Jan. 29  1917 into the intellectual ferment of World War I     Vienna  and a home where his parents  Felix and Helene Deutsch  were both doctors.    He came to the United States in 1935. The family settled in Cambridge.Deutsch received a bachelor's degree in 1937 and the Ph.D. from MIT in 1941  completing in six years a course of study that typically takes 11.After receiving his Ph.D.  he taught and did research for two years at MIT while he underwent a security investigation to get clearance to work on the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos  N.M.

Joanne Miller  66  edited Tech Talk for 31 years,Joanne S. Miller  66  who was editor of MIT Tech Talk for 31 years and co-chair of theAssociation of MIT Retireesafter her retirement  died Sunday evening in the MIT Infirmary after a long struggle with cancer.Elizabeth Whittaker  former associate secretary of the MIT Corporation and    a long-time friend  said  "Joanne was always a reliable source of information    on every aspect of Institute life. She was modest and low-key  but she could    never fully conceal her irrepressible humor and mischievous ways. Her friends    will miss her greatly."Born Sept. 6  1935 in Chelsea  Mich.  Miller grew up in Jamestown  N.Y. and    attended the University of Michigan and Pasadena City College before coming    to MIT in September 1957 as a clerk-typist in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.    Two months later  she became the secretary at Kresge Auditorium  where she sold    tickets and kept records until 1964  when she joined the Office of Public Relations    as a secretary.In July 1965  she was promoted to become the fourth editor of Tech Talk  which    was started in 1957 as a four-page monthly newsletter. In 1971  Tech Talk grew    to an eight-page weekly tabloid newspaper.In 1996  when Miller retired from the News Office after 39 years of service    to MIT  it was calculated that she had edited about 98 percent of the approximately    17 million words that had appeared in the 40 years of Tech Talk issues--a    feat roughly equivalent to editing 160 books.Following retirement  she compiled a directory of theAssociation of MIT Retireesand edited the association's newsletter  MIT Senior Focus. She was the    current co-chair of the association and lived in North Reading. She is survived    by an uncle and several cousins.Miller's ashes will be buried in the family plot in Ann Arbor  Mich. She    is survived by an uncle and cousins  and many friends in the MIT community.The family is making plans to hold a celebration of her life at MIT at a date    to be announced.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon August 28  2002.
Martin Deutsch  MIT physicist who discovered positronium  dies at 85,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Martin Deutsch  a Massachusetts Institute of Technology  physicist from Vienna who fled fascism  worked on the Manhattan Project and later  discovered an elemental form of matter  died Aug. 16 at his home in Cambridge   Mass.  at the age of 85.Deutsch recently had some heart problems  but the immediate cause of death  has not been determined  the family said.Suzanne Z. Deutsch  his wife of 63 years  said in a telephone interview  "There  was nothing in life that he didn't want to understand. That was the hallmark  of his life: understanding and teaching."The crowning achievement of Deutsch's career came in 1951 at age 34  when  he measured and confirmed the existence of positronium.Positronium is a hydrogen-like atom without a nucleus. Its life exists entirely  in a "dance of death" that lasts for as little as 1/10 of a billionth  of a second. The properties of positronium corroborated the quantum theory of  electrodynamics for a two-particle system.Speaking of his MIT discovery at a scientific meeting at Brookhaven National  Laboratory on Dec. 8  1951  Deutsch explained that positronium is composed of  a negative electron (negatron) and a positive electron (positron).The New York Times account the next day stated  "Unlike negative electrons   which flash in a stroke of lightning or flow in a wire as a current of electricity   positrons have an evanescent life measured in millionths of a second. In the cosmic  rays a negatron and a positron constitute a binary system  much like a double  star  with the negatron and positron revolving around each other."Professor Deutsch found there were two forms of positronium  a state of matter  which was first theorized to exist by C.D. Anderson of Caltech in 1932. Parapositronium  decays by annihilation--with a mean life of about 1/10 of a nanosecond  going  into two equal photons (pulses of energy). Orthopositronium  with a mean life  10 times longer  annihilates into three photons."It was a spectacular production on Martin's part " said MIT  Institute Professor of Physics Emeritus Francis Low  who worked with Deutsch on  positronium experiments in MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Deutsch  headed the laboratory from 1973-79 and was succeeded by Low.Low  in a telephone interview  recalled his friend with affection. "Martin  was a remarkably knowledgeable man  a firehose of information in the MIT tradition.  He had a wide understanding of the scientific  social and political scene  had  strong opinions about them and was always delighted to tell you about them."Deutsch was born Jan. 29  1917 into the intellectual ferment of World War I   Vienna  and a home where his parents  Felix and Helene Deutsch  were both doctors.  "Everybody that came to our house had a doctorate of some sort " he  wrote in a three-page autobiographical sketch in "Adventures in Experimental  Physics." In an interview with the Boston Globe in 1998  he said  "I  am  first of all  a product of my culture  which is the culture of Vienna Jews."Before he was two  his mother  a professor in the psychiatry department at  the University of Vienna  began analysis with Sigmund Freud. She became his devoted  last pupil and Freud appointed her director of his Training Institute of the Vienna  Psychoanalytic Society in 1923 when Martin was six."I was an only child " Martin Deutsch told the Boston Globe in a  1998 interview  "and my mother was sure I was a singular point in the universe."In his autobiographical sketch  he wrote  "It was always taken for granted  that I should become a scientist  although as late as my 12th year I seriously  considered electrical engineering as an alternative."At age 17  in February 1934  "I moved rather abruptly to Zurich  Switzerland   having participated in the resistance movement to the Fascist seizure of power  in Austria." He graduated from a Swiss secondary school and completed one  semester the following spring at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology."In October 1935  I accompanied my mother to the United States  fully  intending to return within a few weeks to continue my education in Europe. The  Ethiopian war broke out while we were on the high seas and I decided to stay in  America waiting for things to quiet down in Europe."Deutsch's parents moved to Cambridge and became profoundly influential  in psychiatry--his father in psychosomatic medicine and his mother with her  publication of "The Psychology of Women" and "The Psychology of  Motherhood."Deutsch  brilliant in math and physics  enrolled at MIT and received permission  to get a bachelor's degree in two years. He was drawn to the style of "the  strongest experimental group" in the MIT physics department  the Spectroscopy  Laboratory of Professor George Harrison."It was Harrison's junior course in atomic physics that had the greatest  influence on me " he wrote. "The course was totally disorganized  and  seemed to consist of a series of scientific anecdotes or vignettes. Somehow this  style kindled my enthusiasm  and I still charge many of the insights into physics  and the creative process which I acquired there to this influence."My fellow students were a hard-working lot  but a few of them were a  good deal more than that " he wrote  recalling Richard Feynman  a member  of the MIT Class of 1939. In 1965  Feynman won a Nobel Prize for work in quantum  electrodynamics  a field advanced by Deutsch's discovery of positronium 14  years earlier.Deutsch received a bachelor's degree in 1937 and the Ph.D. from MIT in  1941  completing in six years a course of study that typically takes 11."I have always been a hard worker  but a lazy learner " wrote Deutsch.  "Therefore  I naturally gravitated to the relatively new field of nuclear  physics where there was much to do but not yet too much to learn."In the midst of his studies in 1939  he married Suzanne Zeitlan  a Boston native  who had just graduated from Simmons College with a master's degree in social  work.Deutsch in 1941 was a German subject (because of Germany's takeover of  Austria) and consequently an "enemy alien." He was also an Austrian  citizen and an active antifascist. He taught and did research for two years at  MIT while he underwent a security investigation to get clearance to work on the  atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos  N.M."It was a unique opportunity for a young man  two years after his Ph.D.   to work with almost all the great men in the field--Bohr  Fermi  Bethe  Segrï¿½   Oppenheimer and many others. I had the good fortune of working closely with Emilio  Segrï¿½ and his group on problems of fission physics rather than weapons  technology " he wrote.Among those Los Alamos scientists was future MIT colleague Victor Weisskopf   who had attended the same high school as Deutsch in Vienna  graduating the year  that Deutsch entered the school.Regarding Weisskopf  Deutsch wrote  "Almost 20 years later  when I first  met him in Los Alamos  he produced a photograph of the teacher who had told each  of us that we would end in the gutter."In 1946  Deutsch returned to MIT  where Weisskopf and Bruno Rossi had joined  the physics faculty and Jerrold Zaccharias was building the Laboratory for Nuclear  Science."The next five or six years were harvest years for me. Ideas that had  germinated during the war years led to others  and somehow  it seems ... everything  I touched turned to gold ... I find myself incredulous at the pace at which  new results and new ideas came to fruition."Among his students at the time was the late Henry Kendall  another MIT Institute  Professor who won the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his co-discovery of the quark. Deutsch  was responsible for recruiting to MIT another future Nobel Prize winner  Samuel  Ting  who won the Nobel Prize for the J particle he discovered at the Laboratory  for Nuclear Science while Deutsch was head of the lab."He had a great eye for talented scientists  and not a shred of envy in  him " recalled Mrs. Deutsch  She read a letter that Deutsch  a self-styled  control freak  wrote to a close friend in 1994  seven years after retiring from  MIT."My attitude to prizes is peculiar  not clearly pathological but peculiar "  Deutsch wrote. "I'm really glad that I did not get the Nobel Prize in  1956. It would have spoiled my life."Reflecting about this attitude  he said he suddenly remembered an incident  in the summer of 1923  when his mother was named director of Freud's institute  and the family spent a summer at a Baltic resort. A sack-hopping race had been  organized for the children."I was leading. I recall that I deliberately slowed down in order to come  in second. The reasons for this action were quite complex but an oversimplified  description could be that I did not want to give my mother the satisfaction of  saying  'My son  the sack race winner.'"Deutsch is survived by his wife  who retired from Massachusetts General Hospital  as a supervisor of social work  and two sons  L. Peter Deutsch of Menlo Park   Calif.  and Nicholas Deutsch of New York City. A memorial service will be announced  at a future date.

A reception will be held at 4:30 p.m. across the street at the Faculty Club in the Sloan Building (Wadsworth Street and Memorial Drive).Dornbusch - Rudi to his friends - was widely acclaimed for his seminal research on the theory of exchange rate determination and international economic policy. In a mid-1970s paper on exchange rate dynamics that has become one of the most cited economic contributions of the last half century  Dornbusch showed that shocks to a country's monetary policy could lead to larger exchange rate movements in the short run than in the longer run. In calculating the amount by which short run exchange rate movements would "overshoot" the long run adjustment  Dornbusch developed a solution method for dynamic economic models that has found wide application in many economic contexts.Kenneth Rogoff (Ph.D. 1980)  a Dornbusch student who is now a Harvard professor    and the current economic counselor and director of the IMF Research Department     identified "overshooting" as Dornbusch's key and lasting contribution to international    economics. He described the 1976 paper as "elegant " "path-breaking " and a    "perfect illustration of why the search for abstract beauty can sometimes yield    a large practical payoff for both policy makers and graduate students."EARLY BIRDDornbusch was well known at MIT for his devotion to students and for his demanding classroom style. In 27 years on the MIT faculty  he was the dissertation adviser for more than 125 doctoral students. He trained many of today's leading international economic policy scholars and practitioners. His students have taught at leading universities  and have served in high-ranking posts in finance ministries and central banks around the world.Professor James Poterba  one of Dornbusch's colleagues  recalled that Dornbusch stood out among faculty advisors: "Other faculty held luncheon meetings with their advisees  but Rudi held a weekly breakfast and demanded that his students arrive on time at 8 o'clock - an unknown hour for many students! - to participate in discussions of ongoing research." Poterba noted that in spite of the hour  the students "would not have missed the breakfasts for the world."Dornbusch recently received the Frank Perkins Award for Graduate Student Advising     which is presented annually by the MIT Graduate Student Association. At a celebration    of Dornbusch's 60th birthday last month  Professor Olivier Blanchard  head of    the MIT Department of Economics and a former Dornbusch student himself  presented    Dornbusch with a collection of letters from many of his past students. Many    of the letters cited Dornbusch's boundless enthusiasm for research and policy    analysis as a critical factor in the author's decision to specialize in international    economics  and praised his demanding standards as an advisor. Many also commented    that his joy for life had taught them not just about economics  but about how    to live life to its fullest.NO ANSWER AT 1-800-BAILOUTDornbusch's high expectations of his students arose from years of research and commentary in the very high-stakes world of international economics. He was one of the leading experts on "economic crisis management " and he carried out detailed analysis of many historical episodes of hyperinflation  debt default and related economic maladies.Consistently direct  candid and rigorous  whether writing for an academic journal or offering his opinions in an op-ed piece about how to solve an emerging market crisis  Dornbusch peppered his commentary with wit. In 1998  for example  in arguing that the International Monetary Fund should not pour money into Brazil to stave off an economic crisis  he commented dryly  "When they [Brazil] call 1-800-BAILOUT  just let it ring. Say our operators are busy." Dornbusch had a rare talent for making the global economy comprehensible to broad audiences outside economics  and his wit and humor made him an extremely popular public speaker.Dornbusch was widely regarded as one of the most astute and insightful analysts of the world economic situation  and his advice was widely sought by business groups and participants in financial markets.John Reed  retired chairman of Citigroup and a life member of the MIT Corporation  described Dornbusch as a "this is what the facts are" economist. "He never let fad or emotion obscure the fundamental realities of the economic situation." He was  for example  one of the first to point out that Mexico's economic circumstances in the mid-1990s were not sustainable.Dornbusch was a contributor to Business Week magazine for many years. In 1997  he co-founded FDO Partners  a firm that provided investment advice and managed funds invested in emerging markets. Until just a few weeks before his death  he remained actively involved in analyzing economic policy in developing nations  most recently working with MIT colleague Professor Ricardo Caballero to offer suggestions for fiscal and monetary reform in Argentina.Dornbusch was born on June 8  1942  in Krefeld  Germany. He received his undergraduate training at the University of Geneva  graduating in 1966. He received the M.A. in economics in 1966 and the Ph.D. in 1971  both from the University of Chicago.Dornbusch joined the MIT faculty in 1975 and was promoted to full professor in 1978. He was appointed to the Ford professorship in 1984. Before coming to MIT  Dornbusch held positions at the University of Chicago and the University of Rochester. He was recently named a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economics Association  where he had served in the past as vice president. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Econometric Society.Shortly after he arrived at MIT  Dornbusch and MIT colleague Stanley Fischer collaborated to write "Macroeconomics " a textbook that became a standard reference for a generation of graduate and undergraduate students. The book broke ground in emphasizing the role of international capital markets in determining macroeconomic outcomes. It has been translated into more than a dozen languages and is still in widespread use.Dornbusch is survived by his wife  Sandra Masur of Boston and Washington  and a brother  Paul Josef Dornbusch  of Krefeld.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon August 14  2002.

Pistol coach Melaragno remembered as a straight shooter,Pasquale "Pat" Melaragno  MIT's pistol coach from 1977-96  was    remembered by a generation of MIT sharpshooters last week as an avuncular coach     a fun-loving companion  a compelling raconteur and an all-round straight shooter.Melaragno  71  who was also an assistant professor and rangemaster  died at    home in North Scituate  R.I.  on May 24. Since then  MIT's pistol alumni    from coast to coast have been exchanging fond recollections and anecdotes via    e-mail.What Alan M. Marcum (S.B. 1978) remembers most of all is Melaragno's    smile."His whole being was packed into that smile " said Marcom  who lives    in Palo Alto  Calif. "His eyes  his mouth  his whole face  his entire body     everything he was he packed into that luscious  sometimes mischievous smile.    Several years after I left the Institute  I stopped by the range on a trip to    Boston. Pat was there  with an immediate smile of recognition and hug of welcome.    That was Pat."Joe Mayo (S.B. 1983) of La Jolla  Calif.  recalls how the coach could tell    when he was in a funk and knew how to snap him out of it."One time Pasquale saw that I was very upset over something and I was    letting little things bug me  and not just in matches " Mayo said. "I    was always letting stuff get to me. He told me in a very Pasquale matter-of-fact    way  'Ya gotta roll with the punches. Ya can't let the little things    botha' ya  J.J.' For me it was one of those jaw dropping  look-in-the-mirror    kind of events that changed me  and that I needed to hear."Warren Katz (S.B. 1987) of Cambridge considered the range "my home away    from home." He said  "Pat  being a kinder  gentler version of my dad    and always of good cheer  never made you feel bad about anything." His    coaching style consisted of "gentle reminders of the basics and a never-ending    string of giving waitresses a hard time" while on road trips."I'm really glad I went to the alumni match in April and had the    chance to spend a few minutes reminiscing with him " Katz said. "This    is a great loss for all of us."Kelvin Phoon (S.B. 1987) owned a Volkswagen Rabbit  the same model the coach    drove. Years after he graduated  Melaragno would ask about the car  even though    it was history by then."Whether it was your home town  the little diner that Pat recommended    when your family visited upstate New York  or the truck stop near where your    brother was attending college  Pat always had an interest " said Phoon     a San Diego resident.Between rounds at the 1975 nationals near Phoenix  Melaragno organized a trip    to an out-of-the-way roadside restaurant for what was supposed to be a quick    lunch."As the clock ticked away  we had burgers and chips  and Pat told stories "    said Steve Goldstein of Reading (S.B. 1976). "We made it back with at best    15 minutes to spare before the match. Pat was completely relaxed and unconcerned    about the time even though I'd seriously doubted we'd make it."During Melaragno's tenure  MIT became the premier civilian shooting team    in the country  winning several national championships  including the first-ever    pistol-shooting title for women. The Melaragno Trophy has been awarded to the    women's national air pistol champion since 1999.ARMY  POLICE CAREERSBefore coming to MIT  Melaragno served in the U.S. Army during the Korean    War and as a Providence police officer for 20 years  retiring as a sergeant    in 1973. He retired as a warrant officer from the Army Reserve's criminal    investigation division in 1990.As a member of the All-Army pistol team  Melaragno won four medals in the    Pan American Games in 1972. He was the national air pistol champion in 1975    and was a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.Melaragno is survived by his wife  Joan (Clarke) of North Scituate; three    sons  Steven M. of Greenville  R.I.  Paul C. of Cumberland  R.I.  and Robert    A. of Providence; a daughter  Susan Chabot of Walpole; and 10 grandchildren.

Retired MIT professor Felix Villars dies at 81; was pioneer in biological physics,Professor Emeritus Felix M. H. Villars  81  a theoretical physicist who changed directions in mid-career and became a pioneer in biological physics  died of cancer Saturday  April 27 at his home in Belmont."Felix was a theoretical physicist of great breadth and versatility " said John W. Negele  the W.A. Coolidge Professor of Physics  who was director of the Center for Theoretical Physics when Villars retired in 1991. "He was a gifted and caring teacher with an encyclopedic mastery of physics and enviable clarity of mind."He had a vision of bringing the concepts and rigor of physics to bear on fundamental problems in medicine and biology. By his tireless efforts in teaching at MIT and Harvard Medical School and in writing a series of textbooks  he played a seminal role in creating a new generation of physician-scientists."Villars  who was a member of the MIT faculty for 41 years  played a central role in the development of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health  Sciences and Technology. He embraced the concept that physics and engineering can provide a foundation for advancing medical science. Many classes of medical students and Ph.D. candidates at HST benefited from Villars' insights."Professor Villars' inspirational teaching and curriculum development helped to achieve a major objective of HST  the advancement of the health sciences  by promoting their productive interaction with the physical sciences and engineering " said Irving M. London  founding director of HST."Throughout my years of contact with Felix  I always found him to be a patient listener  insatiably curious  intellectually rigorous  and always kind and considerate " said Dr. Richard Cohen  the Whitaker Professor of Biomedical Engineering at HST. "It was a true privilege to have had the opportunity to work with such a pre-eminent scientist and fine human being. He certainly had a great impact on my career and served as a role model as scientist  teacher and colleague. I will miss him greatly and remember him often."BROAD IMPACTVillars' research had impact on diverse areas of physics.In the infancy of quantum electrodynamics  he and the Swiss Nobel laureate Wolfgang Pauli developed a simple and elegant method to regulate the mathematical singularities in quantum field theory and extract finite physical results. The resulting method  known as "Pauli-Villars regularization " was widely influential and is known and used by all students of field theory.In nuclear physics  he was the first to recognize that the exchange of mesons generating the nuclear force also contributes to the electromagnetic properties of nuclei. With this insight  he calculated the magnetic moments of the three-body nuclei helium and hydrogen and laid the foundation for the systematic study of the effects in nuclei of meson exchange current. He also developed the theory governing the collective rotations of deformed nuclei  such as uranium. Building upon these theoretical developments  both meson exchange currents and rotational states in deformed nuclei were fields of active investigation at MIT's Bates Electron Accelerator Center in Middleton.Villars collaborated with two other eminent theoretical physicists of his generation at MIT on problems in atmospheric physics. With Institute Professor Victor F. Weisskopf  he studied the scattering of radio waves due to atmospheric turbulence. He and Institute Professor Herman Feshbach studied the effect of the earth's magnetic field on ionization in the atmosphere.Later  Villars studied biology and mastered the complexity of biological systems. He then applied rigorous mathematical analysis to elucidate the functioning of biological systems. On the basis of this work  he developed insights not previously discovered by biologists and physiologists who had been working in these areas for years. His mission also included teaching these discoveries.BRILLIANT LECTURERVillars was an extraordinary teacher. He delivered brilliant lectures to both graduate and undergraduate students in nearly every subject offered by the Department of Physics. He had the gift of inventing original and insightful problems  which he formulated with great clarity. Students who solved these problems developed insight and confidence in the power and usefulness of the principles of physics.His courses in quantitative physiology and respiratory pathophysiology at HST were master classes for medical students who sought a deep quantitative insight into organ physiology in health and disease.His undergraduate textbook  a three-volume work titled "Physics with Illustrative Examples from Medicine and Biology " co-authored with MIT professor George B. Benedek  demonstrated to students at the very beginning of their college careers that the principles of physics could illuminate the inner workings of a broad range of biological and medical phenomena."His knowledge was profound  encyclopedic and crystal clear " said Benedek  the Alfred H. Caspary Professor of Physics. "He freely helped his students and professional colleagues to understand deeply an exceptional range of science. He was a rare intellect and brilliant teacher who elevated those who had the good fortune to know him."Born in Biel  Switzerland on Jan. 6  1921  Villars received the diploma in physics and mathematics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1945. He was awarded the Kern Medal for an outstanding undergraduate thesis. During World War II  he served in the Swiss army as a meteorologist and then returned to the Swiss Federal Institute to earn his doctorate in 1946.From 1946 to 1949  he was a research assistant at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  where he collaborated with Pauli on their paper on quantum field theory. He married the former Jacqueline Dubois in 1949 and they moved to the United States  where he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  N.J.  for a year before settling permanently at MIT.He began his MIT career as a research associate in 1950  was appointed assistant professor in 1952  associate professor in 1955  and full professor in 1959. He served as chair of the faculty from 1980 to 1983. He was also a lecturer at Harvard Medical School.In addition to his wife  he is survived by four children  Fred of Philadelphia  Cecile of Belmont  Monique of the Netherlands  and Philip of Northboro; a brother and sister  Hans and Mireille of Switzerland; and three grandchildren. Burial will be at the family's summer home on Cape Cod. A memorial service will be held at MIT in the fall. A memorial fellowship fund will be established at MIT.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon May 8  2002.
Composer  performer  lecturer Edward Cohen dies at age 61,Edward Cohen  composer  performer and senior lecturer in music at MIT  died at his home in Belmont Saturday  April 27 after a long illness. He was 61.Cohen was a classically trained musician inspired by jazz and devoted to new music. His compositions include pieces for solo instruments  chamber ensembles and orchestra  as well as two operas. One of these  "The Bridal Night " his last major work  was premiered this past January by the Collage New Music Ensemble in Boston."He was a great musician and a wonderful teacher " said Professor of Music Ellen Harris  director of the music and theater arts section at MIT."His vision  commitment and perenially renewable enthusiasm were the guiding forces for MIT's music theory curriculum " said Peter Child  professor of music."Eddie was a deeply serious musician  uncompromising in his artistic standards. He was modest to a fault  yet he knew his worth and demanded as much of others as he did of himself " said David Deveau  senior lecturer in music.A 60th birthday concert celebrating Cohen's career as a composer was held last year at MIT. Following it  Cohen  who had had an electric piano brought to his hospital room while he underwent cancer treatments  modestly described his life in music: "In the mornings I compose at home  and in the afternoons I come into MIT and teach " he said.The MIT concert  held in Killian Hall  drew colleagues from MIT and Brandeis  along with students  area musicians and critics. Cohen  depleted by illness  attended in a wheelchair."He was clearly satisfied  and I'll never forget his smile after that concert " said Deveau.The critics did more than smile."Forgive the stereotype  but university professors aren't supposed to compose music like this. The piano quartet was a continuation of Shostakovich's music; the piano sonata  a big-scaled vigorous enterprise " Richard Buell  music critic  wrote in his review of the Cohen concert for The Boston Globe."What kind of 'voice' is this music? A surprisingly lyric  long-spanned one  striking  obviously 'modern.' And all of it built like a steel trap. Gripping music  beautiful performances  a wonderful concert " Buell wrote.Bogdan Fedeles  writing for The Tech  described Cohen as a "living master" of chamber music that is "fascinating in its complex polyphonic sonority."Cohen received numerous awards and commissions for his works from many sources including the Massachusetts Council for the Arts  the MIT Council for the Arts  Tanglewood Music Center and Brandeis University. His clarinet quintet was released on the CRI label.MUSICIAN  MENTOR  FRIENDCohen began teaching at MIT in 1977. Colleagues and students alike pointed to Cohen's generosity of spirit and seriousness of purpose in their memories of working and studying with him."He was my lifelong teacher. His steadfast devotion to truth and honesty in his music and in his personal relations were always an example to me. Most of my most cherished musical ideas around which I continue to grow as a musician stemmed from discussions with Ed " Child said.His students recalled a man of high expectations and low tolerance for distraction or discouragement.Dawn Perlner (S.B. 2001) studied composition with Cohen and recalled his teaching style as both exacting and enthusiastic."I'll never forget the time Professor Cohen was explaining how to compose a sonata form and someone jokingly challenged him to write one for us on the spot. He improvised it at the piano--it was beautiful and in perfect form."Perlner also recalled Cohen's patient resourcefulness as a teacher and mentor."I flunked one exam  yet he did not tell me to drop the class. Instead he told me to go over the exam and re-do all the questions  which I did. He knew how to make students feel talented and in need of improvement at the same time  the perfect balance to get us to learn to be the best musicians possible " said Perlner.Ed Kohler (S.B. 1995  S.M.  Ph.D.) said  "He was patient and kind. He never skimped on feedback. He treated every piece of work we produced as worthy of respect. And he wrote all his comments in complete sentences."Kohler also recalled a moment one Valentine's Day  when the Logarhythms interrupted one of Cohen's classes to serenade a female student. Cohen resisted  then allowed the a cappella group to sing."About a minute in  Professor Cohen put his hands on the piano and joined them  slipping in without a break. His version was all chords  jazzier  hugely harmonized  perfectly in time and in tune. They finished together with a huge crescendo. We clapped like crazy. I was overwhelmed with joy. The Logs left  and Professor Cohen said  'Very simple harmony. Too bad.' Then he went on with class " Kohler said.A LIFE IN MUSICBorn in New York City in 1940  Cohen played piano and trumpet and attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. While writing music in a classical vein  he was inspired by jazz and improvisation. As a teenager he worked as a jazz pianist at resorts in the Catskills  and he retained an avid interest in jazz throughout his life. He frequently entertained family and friends with sparkling and original renditions of jazz standards.Cohen's summer jobs in the Catskills may have nourished an avocation  too. He became an avid pool player and liked to take breaks from composing by shooting pool on a table he kept in his basement  his wife  Marjorie Merryman  said.Cohen's formal musical training was entirely classical. He received the B.A. with honors in music from Brandeis University in 1961 and the M.A. in 1965 from the University of California at Berkeley  where he won the Ladd Prix de Paris  which sponsored two years of composing in Paris.Before coming to MIT  Cohen taught at Brandeis University for 13 years. He also taught at Harvard.Although he was strongly focused on the creation of new music  Cohen found time for other pursuits. He spoke French fluently and had a lifelong interest in French literature and film. He was a determined distance runner who ran the Boston Marathon four times in the 1970s.Cohen is survived by his wife; two daughters  Sarah of Somerville  and Jane of Belmont; his parents  Lawrence and Naomi Cohen of Westport  Conn.; two brothers  Jonathan of Chicago  and Frederick of New York City; and eight nieces and nephews.A memorial service is planned for October 20 from 3 to 5 p.m. in Wong Auditorium and MIT is establishing the Edward Cohen Fund for New Music. Contributions may be sent to MIT  Music and Theater Arts  Cambridge  MA 02139.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon May 8  2002.
Rosenblith dies at 88; pioneered use of computers to study brain,Institute Professor Emeritus and former Provost Walter A. Rosenblith  who pioneered the use of computers and mathematical models in the study of the brain as a biophysical information handling system  died of complications resulting from prostate cancer Wednesday  May 1 in the Miami Heart Institute of Miami Beach  Fla. He was 88 years old.Upon learning of Rosenblith's death  President Charles M. Vest said  "Walter is one of the handful of people who truly defined MIT as it is today. I have thought often of Walter's unstinting dedication to science as an open  international undertaking. That  too  was one of his great legacies."Rosenblith's career included significant accomplishments in the sciences  technology  education  international cooperation and public policy. He was one of a small number of scholars elected to all three of the National Academies--the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. He was elected foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences in 1982  a post he held until 1986. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the World Academy of Arts and Science.Frank Press  president emeritus of the National Academy of Sciences  said: "Walter Rosenblith's contributions as a scientist  engineer and humanist to scholarship  education and international cooperation are no less than monumental. That he also was a distinguished researcher adds to the luster of his career."Rosenblith's deep interest in science  technology and society grew  in part  out of his early studies of the effects of noise on human beings. This research  he said  "alerted me to a number of social problems that come from the incautious use of technology." He helped found the Program in Science  Technology and Society and later joined it.Rosenblith had a long and distinguished tenure at MIT  helping to shape it during turbulent times and ensure its world-class status. He joined the faculty in 1951 as an associate professor of communications biophysics in the Department of Electrical Engineering (renamed the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1975). He was elevated to full professor in 1957 and named Institute Professor in 1975. He was elected by his colleagues as chair of the faculty from 1967 to 1969.As MIT's associate provost from 1969 to 1971 and provost from 1971 to 1980  he played a central role in developing the health sciences and biomedical engineering disciplines at the Institute  in forging MIT's collaboration with other universities and medical institutions  and in fostering greater attention to the interplay among science  technology and society. While associate provost  he also was acting director of the Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies.In 1994  MIT established a chair in his honor. Ann M. Graybiel of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences  the first Walter A. Rosenblith Professor of Neuroscience  still holds the chair. Fifty Walter A. Rosenblith graduate fellowships were created in 1997  and Rosenblith was particularly pleased that they covered all of the schools at MIT. At the time of his death  Rosenblith was working on a book about his close friend  MIT's former president Jerome B. Wiesner.In the words of Howard Johnson  MIT president from 1966 to 1971: "Walter Rosenblith was a noble academic whose enthusiastic participation for 50 years in MIT life as Institute Professor  faculty chair  provost and  most of all  as a rare human being will leave an indelible mark on the Institute. Those of us who were privileged to work with him will remember his many contributions and especially his deep insight and understanding of MIT and the culture of science  technology and ethics that pervades this institution."Born in Vienna  Austria on Sept. 21  1913  Rosenblith studied in Vienna  Berlin  Lausanne  Paris and Bordeaux. He held degrees in communications engineering from the University of Bordeaux (1936) and the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite  Paris (1937). In 1939 he came to the United States to study the effects of industrial noise on human beings. When the outbreak of World War II prevented his return to France  he conducted research and taught physics at New York University and the University of California at Los Angeles  where he met and married Judy Olcott Francis of Manhattan Beach  Calif.  his wife of 60 years.From 1943 to 1947 Rosenblith was a member of the physics faculty at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City. In 1947  he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory. While there he became increasingly involved in psychophysics and neurophysiology. He was  in his own words  "sucked into the brain through the ear."His early work in hearing led Rosenblith to collaborate with faculty members of the Harvard Medical School in the formation of the Eaton Peabody Laboratory for Auditory Physiology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Rosenblith was appointed research associate in otology (1957-69)  then lecturer in otology and otolaryngology at the Harvard Medical School. He was editor of the MIT Press volumes "Processing Neuroelectric Data and Sensory Communication " and author of numerous papers in a broad range of scientific journals.He served on many technical committees and advisory boards  executive committees  and as a member of several academic societies. Rosenblith was fond of quoting a Harvard colleague as saying  "For Rosenblith  talking is the easiest form of breathing."Rosenblith served on the International Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of China (1977-1986)  and was named a consulting professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 1988. He served on the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Brandeis University Board of Trustees. From 1978-1986 he was a member of the President's Board on Foreign Scholarships (Fulbright)  serving as its chair in 1980-1981  and as a member of the USIA Advisory Panel on International Educational Exchange from 1982-1986.President Francois Mitterrand of France named Rosenblith a "Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur" in 1982 for his services at MIT and elsewhere  on behalf of intellectual and scientific exchanges between the United States and France. In 1989 he was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Medal. He was awarded the Okawa Prize in 1999 for outstanding contributions to research.U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) noted: "Walter Rosenblith was one of the most influential leaders of the international scientific community during the last 50 years. From his service as foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences and his participation with the World Bank in strengthening Chinese universities after the Cultural Revolution  to his many awards  Walter Rosenblith built bridges to the world through science. I am grateful for his personal support and friendship."U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: "I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Walter Rosenblith. He was a brilliant scientist who devoted his life to developing groundbreaking scientific research. He will be missed."Rosenblith received honorary Sc.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (1976)  the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (1980)  Brandeis (1988) and the University of Miami (1992). He was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1976  the year in which he was designated an honorary alumnus by the MIT Association of Alumni and Alumnae.Rosenblith is survived by his wife  Judy  a professor emerita of psychology at Wheaton College who lives in Marstons Mills and Miami; a daughter  Sandy  of Chevy Chase  Md.; a son  Ron  of McLean  Va.; a brother  Eric  of Newton; a grandson and two granddaughters. Burial will be private; contributions may be made in his name to MIT for the Wiesner book project or to the Union of Concerned Scientists. A memorial service will be scheduled at MIT.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon May 8  2002.

Wiesner.In the words of Howard Johnson  MIT's president from 1966 to 1971: "Walter Rosenblith was a noble academic whose enthusiastic participation for 50 years in MIT life as Institute Professor  faculty chair  provost  and  most of all as a rare human being will leave an indelible mark on the Institute. Those of us who were privileged to work with him will remember his many contributions and especially his deep insight and understanding of MIT and the culture of science  technology and ethics that pervades this institution."Born in Vienna  Austria on Sept. 21  1913  Rosenblith studied in Vienna  Berlin  Lausanne  Paris and Bordeaux. He held degrees in communications engineering from the University of Bordeaux (1936) and the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite  Paris (1937). In 1939 he came to the United States to study the effects of industrial noise on human beings. When the outbreak of World War II prevented his return to France  he conducted research and taught physics at NYU and UCLA  where he met and married Judy Olcott of Manhattan Beach  Calif.  his wife of 60 years.From 1943 to 1947 Rosenblith was a member of the physics faculty at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City. In 1947  he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory. While there he became increasingly involved in psychophysics and neurophysiology. He was  in his own words  "sucked into the brain through the ear."His early work in hearing led Rosenblith to collaborate with faculty members of the Harvard Medical School in the formation of the Eaton Peabody Laboratory for Auditory Physiology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Rosenblith was appointed research associate in otology (1957-69) then lecturer in otology and otolaryngology at the Harvard Medical School. He was editor of the MIT Press volumes "Processing Neuroelectric Data and Sensory Communication" and author of numerous papers in a broad range of scientific journals.He served on many technical committees and advisory boards  executive committees  and as a member of several academic societies. Rosenblith was fond of quoting a Harvard colleague as saying  "For Rosenblith  talking is the easiest form of breathing."He used that capacity in part through lecturing widely in the United States and abroad. He was Inaugural Lecturer at India's Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (Bombay) and Weizmann Lecturer at the Weizmann Institute of Science  Rehovot  Israel  in 1962. He taught in General Electric's Modern Engineering Course (1964-68)  was a visiting professor at the Technical University  Berlin  during the summers of 1965 and 1966  and at the Institute of Biophysics  University of Rio de Janeiro in 1971  1973 and 1976.Rosenblith served on the International Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of China (1977-86)  and was named a consulting professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 1988. He served on the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Brandies University Board of Trustees. From 1978-86 he was a member of the President's Board on Foreign Scholarships (Fulbright)  serving as its chair in 1980-81  and as a member of the USIA Advisory Panel on International Educational Exchange from 1982-86.President Francois Mitterrand of France named Rosenblith a "Chevalier de l'Ordre National de la Legion d'Honneur" in 1982 for his services at MIT and elsewhere on behalf of intellectual and scientific exchanges between the U.S. and France. In 1989 he was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt medal. He was awarded the Okawa Prize in 1999 for outstanding contributions to research.U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) noted: "Walter Rosenblith was one of the most influential leaders of the international scientific community during the last 50 years. From his service as Foreign Secretary of the National Academy of Sciences and his participation with the World Bank in strengthening Chinese universities after the Cultural Revolution  to his awards like the French Legion of Honor  the German Alexander von Humboldt Medal and the esteemed Japanese Okawa prize  Walter Rosenblith built bridges to the world through science. I am grateful for his personal support and friendship."U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: "I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Walter Rosenblith. He was a brilliant scientist who devoted his life to developing groundbreaking scientific research He will be missed."Rosenblith received honorary Sc.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (1976)  the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (1980)  Brandeis (1988) and the University of Miami (1992). He was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1976  the year in which he was designated an honorary alumnus by the MIT Association of Alumni and Alumnae.Rosenblith is survived by his wife  Judy  of Marstons  Mass. and Miami  a professor emerita of psychology at Wheaton College; a daughter  Sandy  of Chevy Chase  Md.; a son  Ron  of McLean  Va.; a brother  Eric  of Newton  Mass.; a grandson  Justin Borysenko  and two granddaughters  Gillet and Charlton. Burial will be private; contributions may be made in his name to MIT for the Wiesner book project or to the Union of Concerned Scientists. A memorial service will be scheduled at MIT.
Retired MIT professor Felix Villars dies at 81; was pioneer in biological physics,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- MIT Professor Emeritus Felix M. H. Villars  81  a theoretical physicist who changed directions in mid-career and became a pioneer in biological physics  died of cancer Saturday (April 27) at home in Belmont  Mass."Felix was a theoretical physicist of great breadth and versatility " said John W. Negele  the W.A. Coolidge Professor of Physics at MIT  who was director of the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics when Villars retired in 1991. "He was a gifted and caring teacher with an encyclopedic mastery of physics and enviable clarity of mind."He had a vision of bringing the concepts and rigor of physics to bear on fundamental problems in medicine and biology. By his tireless efforts in teaching at MIT and Harvard Medical School and in writing a series of textbooks  he played a seminal role in creating a new generation of physician-scientists."Villars  who was a member of the MIT faculty for 41 years  played a central role in the development of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health  Sciences and Technology (HST). He embraced the concept that physics and engineering can provide a foundation for advancing medical science. Many classes of medical students and Ph.D. candidates at HST benefited from Villars' insights."Professor Villars' inspirational teaching and curriculum development helped to achieve a major objective of HST  the advancement of the health sciences by promoting their productive interaction with the physical sciences and engineering " said Irving M. London  founding director of HST."Throughout my years of contact with Felix  I always found him to be a patient listener  insatiably curious  intellectually rigorous  and always kind and considerate " said Dr. Richard Cohen  the Whitaker Professor of Biomedical Engineering at HST. "It was a true privilege to have had the opportunity to work with such a pre-eminent scientist and fine human being. He certainly had a great impact on my career and served as a role model as scientist  teacher and colleague. I will miss him greatly and remember him often."Villars' research had impact on diverse areas of physics.In the infancy of quantum electrodynamics  he and the Swiss Nobel Laureate Wolfgang Pauli developed a simple and elegant method to regulate the mathematical singularities in quantum field theory and extract finite physical results. The resulting method  known as "Pauli-Villars regularization " was widely influential and is known and used by all students of field theory.In nuclear physics  he was the first to recognize that the exchange of mesons generating the nuclear force also contributes to the electromagnetic properties of nuclei. With this insight  he calculated the magnetic moments of the three-body nuclei helium and hydrogen and laid the foundation for the systematic study of meson exchange current effects in nuclei. He also developed the theory governing the collective rotations of deformed nuclei such as uranium. Building upon these theoretical developments  both meson exchange currents and rotational states in deformed nuclei were fields of active investigation at MIT's Bates Electron Accelerator Center in Middleton  Mass.He collaborated with two other eminent theoretical physicists of his generation at MIT on problems in atmospheric physics. With Institute Professor Victor F. Weisskopf  he studied the scattering of radio waves due to atmospheric turbulence. He and Institute Professor Herman Feshbach studied the effect of the earth's magnetic field on ionization in the atmosphere.Later  Villars studied biology and mastered the complexity of biological systems. He then applied rigorous mathematical analysis to elucidate the functioning of biological systems. On the basis of this work  he developed insights not previously discovered by biologists and physiologists who had been working in these areas for years. His mission also included teaching these discoveries.Villars was an extraordinary teacher. He delivered brilliant lectures to both graduate and undergraduate students in nearly every subject offered by the Department of Physics. He had the gift of inventing original and insightful problems  which he formulated with great clarity. Students who solved these problems developed insight and confidence in the power and usefulness of the principles of physics.His courses in Quantitative Physiology and Respiratory Pathophysiology at HST were master classes for medical students who sought a deep quantitative insight into organ physiology in health and disease.His undergraduate textbook  a three-volume work titled "Physics with Illustrative Examples from Medicine and Biology " co-authored with MIT professor George B. Benedek  demonstrated to students at the very beginning of their college career that the principles of physics could illuminate the inner workings of a broad range of biological and medical phenomena."His knowledge was profound  encyclopedic and crystal clear " said Benedek  the Alfred H. Caspary Professor of Physics. "He freely helped his students and professional colleagues to understand deeply an exceptional range of science. He was a rare intellect and brilliant teacher who elevated those who had the good fortune to know him."For many years  Villars taught undergraduate courses based on these textbooks. In recent years  long into his retirement  he and Benedek taught a popular graduate course in biological physics and worked on a graduate level text.His teaching of biology and medicine from the point of view of the physicist inspired generations of gifted students to pursue careers at the fruitful interface between the physical and biological sciences. Many of these students have gone on to leadership positions in medical research and teaching inspired by his insights.Born in Biel  Switzerland on Jan. 6  1921  Villars received the diploma in physics and mathematics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1945. He was awarded the Kern Medal for an outstanding undergraduate thesis. During World War II  he served in the Swiss army as a meteorologist and then returned to the Swiss Federal Institute to earn his doctorate in 1946.From 1946 to 1949  he was a research assistant at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  where he collaborated with Pauli on their paper on quantum field theory. He married the former Jacqueline Dubois in 1949 and they moved to the United States  where he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  N.J.  for a year before settling permanently at MIT.He began his MIT career as a research associate in 1950  was appointed assistant professor in 1952  associate professor in 1955  and full professor in 1959. He served as chair of the faculty from 1980 to 1983. He was also a lecturer at Harvard Medical School.In addition to his wife  he is survived by four children  Fred of Philadelphia  Cecile of Belmont  Mass.  Monique of Delft  the Netherlands  and Philip of Northboro  Mass.; a brother and sister  Hans and Mireille of Biel  Switzerland; and three grandchildren. Burial will be at the family's summer home on Cape Cod. A memorial service will be held at MIT in the fall. A memorial fellowship fund will be established at MIT.
Memorial Service scheduled for Samuel Goldblith,A memorial service to celebrate the life of Professor Samuel A. Goldblith  who passed away in December  will be held Tuesday  May 28 at 3 p.m. in Killian Hall (14W-111).Goldblith was a professor of food science and technology at MIT  a leader in  the field of food preservation and a tireless advocate of business and educational  cooperation between the United States and Japan.

Weisskopf dies at 93; was protégé of physicist Niels Bohr,Institute Professor Emeritus Victor F. Weisskopf  a protégé of physicist Niels Bohr who helped develop the atomic bomb and later became an outspoken advocate of arms control  died Sunday night at his home in Newton  Mass. He was 93 years old.Weisskopf--called "Viki" by all who knew him--was noted for his theoretical work in quantum electrodynamics  the structure of the atomic nucleus and elementary particle physics. But beyond his purely scientific accomplishments  he played a leading role in explaining science--and its role in society--to the public. In the years since his work on the Manhattan Project in World War II  he warned repeatedly of the growing danger of nuclear war."Viki was a giant of 20th-century physics  a great spokesman for peace  for the welfare of humanity and the beauty of physics " said Professor Robert L. Jaffe  director of the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics. "He was a friend to everyone who knew him. His influence here at MIT and in the Center for Theoretical Physics was beneficent and profound. His perpetual curiosity and his enthusiasm for new ideas and young people defined MIT's style of doing physics. We will miss him."Weisskopf was director-general from 1961 to 1965 of the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva  Switzerland  heading an international research establishment that operated the world's second most powerful large particle accelerator or "atom smasher" just as it started to be used for research. Under his direction  CERN developed into one of the foremost institutions in this field.When he returned to MIT from CERN in 1966 he was given the rank of Institute Professor. From 1967 to 1973  Weisskopf was head of the Department of Physics  where he was a major force in the development of physics research--both through the many students he taught and the research group he built up to become the present Center for Theoretical Physics.Additional recognition from the MIT faculty came in 1973 when he was awarded the James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award.Weisskopf formally retired from MIT on July 30  1974  after 28 years at the Institute  but he remained active as a senior lecturer in physics. In October 1974  a large number of the world's leading scientists  including six Nobel laureates  gathered at MIT for a two-day symposium convened specifically in celebration of Weisskopf and his contributions to science and society.A naturalized United States citizen since 1943  Weisskopf was born in Vienna  Austria  on Sept. 19  1908. He received the Ph.D. from the University of Gottingen  Germany in 1931  and served as research associate at the University of Copenhagen from 1932 to 1933 and the Institute of Technology in Zurich from 1934 to 1936.Bohr  the Nobel Prize-winning Danish physicist and founder of quantum mechanics  was Weisskopf's mentor during their time together in Copenhagen. While in Denmark  Weisskopf met his first wife  ballet dancer Ellen Tvede  who died many years ago.Weisskopf once told an interviewer that he had come out of the "golden age" of physics  when European scientists in the 1920s and 1930s created a new picture of how the world behaved at the atomic level."We touched the nerve of the universe " he said. "It was a great revolution that allowed us for the first time in the history of science to get at the root of the matter--why are leaves green  why are metals hard  why are the mountains so high and not higher--all those natural questions of our immediate environment got an answer."Those who knew him say Weisskopf made major contributions to that work by seeing through the mathematics to the principles beneath."Viki is a past master at taking subtle and mathematical and opaque material  and by careful thought  reformulating it into a simple  clear problem " said physicist Philip Morrison  an Institute Professor Emeritus who was Weisskopf's colleague at MIT.JOURNEY TO MITIn 1937  just before the Nazis took over Austria  Weisskopf came to the United States to the University of Rochester  where he served as instructor and then assistant professor.In 1943 he joined the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos  N.M.  where he worked on the atom bomb project as a group leader and associate head of the theory division on the exploitation of nuclear energy.In 1944 he was one of many physicists who participated in the founding of the Federation of Atomic Scientists. Its purpose was twofold: to warn the public of the consequences of atomic war--thus hoping for the creation of an international agreement against the use of atomic weapons--and to support the peaceful use of atomic energy.In 1945 he was appointed associate professor of physics at MIT but was granted a leave of absence to complete his work at Los Alamos. In 1946 he came to the Institute as a full professor  and later was in charge of the theory group in MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science  where he and his group made important contributions to theories of nuclear reactions and quantum electrodynamics. Together with John M. Blatt  he wrote a textbook  "Theoretical Nuclear Physics " probably the most-used book in that subject.In 1949 Weisskopf became a member of the emergency committee of scientists whose president was Albert Einstein. This committee fought for control of atomic weapons and for an understanding between the countries of the East and West concerning atomic armaments. He participated in a manifesto against the hydrogen bomb in 1950 and in a campaign for the exchange of scientists by the U.S. and the rest of the world.He spent increasing amounts of time in the years following his retirement attempting to raise public awareness of the dangers of nuclear weapons  weapons he had helped to create.In a 1983 interview  he referred to the nuclear bomb as "a shadow over my life." And in an address that same year to a reunion of scientists who had worked to develop the atomic bomb  he described that effort as "the most exciting years of our lives." But he added  "our achievement has been the unintended cause of the world's most tragic predicament. Therefore  we physicists have a special duty." Another time he commented  "There is such fantastic beauty  in landscape  poetry  painting  and now these are all threatened."While immersing himself in the issue of arms control  Weisskopf also said that "political questions take a lot of nervous energy" and that he always returned to physics for relaxation. "When life is very bad " he told an interviewer  "two things make life worth living--Mozart and quantum mechanics."In another expression of his philosophy  when he was profiled on the public television series "Nova" in 1984  he likened the big-bang theory of the universe to a work by Haydn and suggested that Haydn's music is in its own way as descriptive of the big-bang theory as are the words of physicists. "I do not believe in the supernatural " he said  but he insisted that there is "something divine in our lives."While he was at CERN  Weisskopf's numerous awards were augmented with the conferral of an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Vienna on the 600th anniversary of that institution. He received numerous other honorary degrees from institutions throughout the world  including Brandeis  Harvard  Notre Dame  Oxford  Rockefeller University  Yale and the Weizmann Institute.His book "Knowledge and Wonder: The Natural World as Man Knows It" also was published (Doubleday & Co.  New York  1962) while he was in Geneva. It was selected by the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation as the best science book of the year for youth. Some of his essays are collected in the book  "Physics in the XX Century " published by the MIT Press. His own series of essays  "The Privilege of Being a Physicist " was published in 1989 (W.H. Freeman & Co.  New York). He co-authored a two-volume book  "Concepts of Particle Physics " with MIT alumnus Kurt Gottfried  a theoretical physicist at Cornell University.In 1991  Weiskopf wrote "The Joy of Insight " a personal memoir published by Basic Books as part of series of autobiographies and biographies of contemporary scientists sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.On his departure from CERN  his international colleagues collaborated in publishing a volume of 39 essays dedicated to Weisskopf. The volume's preface said in part: "It is Weisskopf's unique achievement that he has carried over the devoted idealism and the enthusiasm of his early days into a new world of organized research and large-scale experimentation. Through the work he did at CERN  through the impact of his mature personality  he has had a profound influence on modern physics in Europe."HONORED BY THE WORLDWeisskopf's international honors included the Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society in 1956  the Boris Pregal Medal of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1970  the Prix Mondial Cino de Duca (France) for humanism in science in 1972  the Order pour le Merite (German) in 1978  the Smolukowski Medal of the Polish Physical Society in 1979  the National Medal of Science (United States) in 1980  the Wolf Prize in Physics (Israel) in 1981  the J.

He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and served as its president in 1960-61. He was president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1976 to 1979.In December 1975  he was named by Pope Paul VI to the 70-member Pontifical Academy of Sciences  which honored "pure science wherever it is found."

Retired professor Patrick Leehey  former Naval captain  dies at 80,Professor Emeritus Patrick Leehey  who taught ocean and mechanical engineering courses at MIT for 28 years following a 22-year career in the Navy  died of pancreatic cancer at home in Swampscott on March 4. He was 80 years old.Born on Oct. 27  1921 in Waterloo and raised in Oelwein  Iowa  Leehey attended    the University of Iowa and the United States Naval Academy  graduating in 1942.    During World War II  he served aboard the battleships the USS Washington and    the USS Wisconsin. He participated in the third battle of Savo Island  Nov.    15-16  1942  and was in the task forces at Iwo Jima  Okinawa. Leehey married    the former Dorothy Irene Feltus of Oelwein on Feb. 3  1944 between tours of    duty.In 1945  Leehey participated in the bombardment of the Japanese mainland and    was a member of the First Navy-Marine Corps landing party that went ashore at    Yokosuka prior to the Japanese surrender.At the end of the war  Leehey attended the Naval post-graduate school at Annapolis    and Brown University and earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Brown in    1950. He served in the Mediterranean on board the USS Columbus during the Korean    War.NAVAL ENGINEERLeehey played a major role in the development of Naval hydrofoil craft at the    Office of Naval Research in Washington  served as design superintendent at the    Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 1956 to 1958  and as head of the newly established    Acoustics and Vibration Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin in 1963-64.

Lidsky of nuclear engineering dies; questioned fusion power,Retired professor Lawrence M. Lidsky of nuclear engineering  who went public    with his reservations about the efficacy of fusion as an energy source after    devoting his career to its development  died Friday at his home in Newton after    a 17-year battle with cancer. He was 66 years old.Lidsky  a Cornell University graduate whose MIT doctoral thesis in 1962 was    titled "Plasma Generation and Acceleration " was assistant director    of the Plasma Fusion Center when he published an article in 1983 titled "The    Trouble With Fusion" in Technology Review. He wrote the piece  Lidsky said    at the time  because "I couldn't get an internal discussion going.    Some didn't care and some didn't want to know." A short time    after the article appeared  Lidsky resigned his position at the Plasma Fusion    Center. Congress reduced funding for the fusion program by 5 percent the next    year. It was renamed the Plasma Science and Fusion Center in December 1997."Larry Lidsky was one of the smartest people I ever met " said Professor    Jeffrey P. Freidberg  head of the Department of Nuclear Engineering. "He    was often way ahead of his time in delivering insightful and crucial analysis    of the prospects of both fusion and fission power. In the fusion area  Professor    Lidsky was one of the earliest engineers to point out some of the very  very    difficult engineering challenges facing the program and how these challenges    would affect the ultimate desirability of fusion energy. As one might imagine     his messages were not always warmly received initially  but they have nevertheless    stood the test of time."Lidsky later became a passionate advocate of the development of meltdown-proof    Modular High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors  which depend upon nuclear fission    rather than fusion for their energy. Initially  the idea engendered little enthusiasm    in the United States  but in recent years the idea resurfaced "in a much    more friendly environment " said Freidberg. "Our department is leading    a national research effort to construct a large-scale test facility based on    this concept " he said. "Many of the technical ideas are directly    attributable to Larry's early analysis." Such plants are now being    developed in Japan and elsewhere.Lidsky  born in New York on Oct. 15  1935  grew up in Brooklyn and attended    Brooklyn Technical High School. He received a B.Eng. from Cornell with honors    in 1958. In March of that year  he met his future wife  Judith Lockser  who    was studying government. They were married on Aug. 31  1958. Loren Lidsky  their    oldest child  said  "My mother was the greatest influence on his life.    They always said that they grew up together."Upon graduation  Lidsky matriculated in the nuclear engineering graduate program    at MIT while his wife attended Harvard Law School. After receiving the Ph.D.    in 1962  he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. He became an associate    professor in 1968 and full professor in 1976. He was appointed associate director    of the Plasma Fusion Center in 1978.He was the founder and first editor of the Journal of Fusion Energy and a major    contributor to the departmental report  "Nuclear Power Plant Innovation    for the 1990s: A Preliminary Assessment " published in 1984.Lidsky was the guiding force and one of the founders of the MIT Faculty Newsletter    in 1988 and served on the editorial board until his death. He retired from the    faculty last summer and hoped to spend more time at a family home in Diamond    Cove  Maine  which he helped design.A consummate scientist and engineer  he designed and built an innovative kayak    and was active in a wine-making group that labeled its wine "Mauvais Garcon"    ("bad boy" in French). While friends  family and students considered    him a Renaissance man  Lidsky described himself in simpler terms. "I teach "    he always replied when asked what he did. Lidsky supervised more than 80 graduate    theses.Dr. Robert Friedman  head of the wine-making group  said  "Larry was a    true life force--witty  intelligent  irreverant  opinionated  enthusiastic     thoughtful  joyful  charming and a caring person. I will miss him. We will miss    him. We all will never forget him."Lidsky was diagnosed with renal cell cancer in September 1984. After 11 years    in remission  he underwent a series of treatments  many of them experimental.    He had developed a network of cancer researchers with whom he consulted regularly    and his own recent research centered on the production of medically important    isotopes via photoneutronic processes. He was the holder of numerous patents.Lidsky served as a consultant to the US General Accounting Office  the Office    of Technical Assessment  the National Science Foundation  the Princeton Plasma    Physics Laboratory  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Argonne National    Laboratory. He consulted on energy programs and policies in Japan  the Netherlands    and Norway and lectured widely.Lidsky was a member of the American Nuclear Society  the American Physical    Society and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.In addition to his wife  Lidsky is survived by his mother  Ada Lidsky of Waltham;    two sons  Loren of Newton and David of Oakland  Calif.; a daughter  Jane Gray    of Franklin; two brothers  Arthur of Belmont and Ted of Manalapen  N.J.; a sister     Judy of Valley Stream  N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.Services were private.

Retired MITSO conductor David Epstein is dead at 71,Professor David M. Epstein conducted Beethoven's ninth symphony at his  farewell performance with the MIT Symphony Orchestra in March 1998  which included  the "Ode to Joy" chorale section. It capped a 33-year MIT career during  which he brought the joy of music to campus.Epstein  71  died on Jan. 15 at Emerson Hospital in Concord from complications  of lung and liver disease. A memorial service will be held at MIT on April 21.Bonnie Kellerman  recording secretary in the Treasurer's Office  played  many concerts with the second violin section under Epstein's direction as  both an undergraduate and staff member  including at his final performance."It was a thrill for each of us in the orchestra to once again have the  opportunity of having David lead us in making beautiful music " said Kellerman  (S.B. 1972). "David was an educator who gave a great deal to all who had  the privilege of knowing him."Kellerman organized an orchestra reunion weekend of events surrounding the  concert  celebrating the conductor's career. Her memory of a post-rehearsal  luncheon that lasted six hours is still vivid. "David was so enjoying catching  up with his former students  sharing his visions and passion for his upcoming  undertakings  and generally imparting knowledge about music and other related  topics " she said.Professor Alan J. Grodzinsky  director of the Center for Biomedical Engineering   joined the MIT Symphony Orchestra (MITSO) as a freshman in 1965  Epstein's  first year on the podium. Grodzinsky was the principal viola player for eight  years and toured with the group. "David made it clear to students that MITSO  was an organization that made real music--an intense  serious  but also extraordinarily  enjoyable experience at the end of the day " said Grodzinsky  who also performed  at the final concert.Grodzinsky took Epstein's "Music from the Baroque and Romantic Era"  class. "He was a really enthusiastic and clear lecturer " he recalled.  "I remember his playing at the piano  and his comments at the end of our  first term paper that MIT students were incredibly smart  fun to teach  but terrible  writers."Epstein expanded MITSO's audience by mixing new and rarely heard works  with those of major composers in the same program  engaging professional and student  soloists  and planning and leading tours throughout the United States and abroad.  He wrote insightful listener notes and embarked on an ambitious commercial recording  venture with the orchestra  which has preserved on the Vox label more than a decade  of its finest performances. Due primarily to his drive to raise its artistic goals  and standards  the orchestra became the first co-curricular performing ensemble  through which MIT students could earn study credit toward a degree."David Epstein's contribution to the vitality of music making at  MIT is broad and deep " said Professor Marcus A. Thompson  a violist who  collaborated frequently with Epstein. He noted that Epstein's "scholarly  inquiry" into structure  tempo and articulation provided guidance for performers  to make better interpretive decisions. "Some of this inquiry grew out of  the obvious pleasure he took in teaching as well as learning from students and  colleagues in the MIT scientific community " he said.A 1952 graduate of Antioch College  Epstein had graduate degrees from the New  England Conservatory  Brandeis University and Princeton University. He received  a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1968.Before joining the MIT faculty as an associate professor and conductor of MITSO  in 1965  Epstein taught at Antioch and Sarah Lawrence College. He became a full  professor in 1971 and chaired the music department in 1982-83 and 1988-89.Epstein helped found the New York Youth Symphony Orchestra and conducted its  debut concert in 1963 at Carnegie Hall  featuring a 17-year-old violin prodigy  named Itzhak Perlman. Later in his career  he was on the podium with the New Orchestra  of Boston when it performed with legendary jazz drummer Max Roach.He was music director of the Harrisburg (Penn.) Symphony Orchestra from 1974-78  and the Worcester Orchestra from 1976-80. He appeared as a guest conductor with  28 orchestras in nine countries  He conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in  1972 in the premier of "Night Voices " written on commission for the  BSO by Epstein and his wife  Anne  an author of children's books.While at MIT  Epstein observed that brilliance in science and music often went  hand in hand. "As with many of us  my students were my professors "  he wrote in an essay on music and science in 2000  when he was a senior fellow  in the arts and humanities. "In a way  we enjoy at MIT what some 100 years  ago was a norm in European culture  a diverse  literate and active musical society."Epstein did research on music and the brain at the Max Planck Institute for  Behavioral Physiology in Germany which led to theories about the role time and  motion play in music of all cultures. He explored these theories in two books   "Beyond Orpheus: Studies in Musical Structure" (1979) and the award-winning  "Shaping Time: Music  the Brain and Performance" (1995).While at Antioch in the 1950s  Epstein helped desegregate barbershops in Ohio  when he testified against a white barber who claimed he was not able to cut African-American  hair. Epstein  who had thick  black curly hair at the time  had it cut by the  barber and then appeared as a witness against him in the successful lawsuit.A native of New York City  he loved to ski and sail  and he maintained a shop  in the garage of his Lexington home in which he exercised his mechanical creativity.

Retired Dean Alfred A.H. Keil is dead at 88,Retired Dean of Engineering Alfred A.H. Keil  one of the world's leading authorities on naval architecture and ocean engineering  died Jan. 9 at the Goddard Nursing Home in Jamaica Plain.Keil  who suffered from Alzheimer's disease  was 88 years old.When Keil stepped down as dean of the School of Engineering in 1977  President    Jerome B. Wiesner and Chancellor Paul E. Gray issued a statement praising his    "distinguished" leadership. "He has made a lasting contribution    to the school and to the Institute through his efforts to articulate a new and    broader vision of engineering education and to use the resources of the school    with increased effectiveness " they said.Professor James D. Bruce  an associate dean under Keil who served as interim    dean after Keil's departure  remembered him as a remarkable scientist and    engineer  an innovative educator and a friend."His ideas concerning engineering and science education  though early     have stood the test of time and many are being implemented now " said Bruce     who is vice president for information systems. "Alfred was often seen via    a stern Germanic exterior. However  he really had a warm heart. He cared about    people. I often think of seeing him with my children when they would come to    the office at the end of the day. Alfred was really a special colleague and    friend to me."Keil  who was born in Konradswaldau  Germany  on May 1  1913  received the    Doctor of Natural Science degree from Friederich Wilhelm University in 1939.    He subsequently conducted research and experimentation on the physics and effects    of underwater explosions.After World War II  Keil worked for the US Naval Technical Mission in Germany    in 1945-46 and came to the United States in 1947 to join the Navy's Bureau    of Ships. He was chief scientist of the Navy's Underwater Explosion Research    Division in Portsmouth  Va.  for 12 years and became an authority on ship protection.In 1959  Keil became technical director of the Structural Mechanics Laboratory    at the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin in Washington  D.C.  and was the    first technical director for the entire organization from 1963-66. During this    period  he made extensive contributions to improving the structural integrity    and survivability of naval vessels.Keil came to MIT in 1966 as head of the Department of Naval Architecture and    Marine Engineering (now the Department of Ocean Engineering)  the oldest academic    department of its kind in the country. Under his direction  the department added    a graduate degree program in 1967 and launched a joint degree program with Woods    Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1969.Not long after his arrival at MIT  Congress passed the National Sea Grant College    and Program Act. Re-cognizing the opportunity for MIT to benefit from participation    in this new marine program  Keil moved quickly and succeeded in obtaining the    first grant awarded by the new national program. His leadership led to the establishment    of the MIT Sea Grant Program in 1970. He was the program's first director.    In December 1976  MIT became the first private university in the nation to be    declared a Sea Grant College.Following his term as dean of engineering  Keil was named a Ford Professor    of Engineering. In that role  he continued to champion what he termed "the    wiser use of science and technology " urging engineers to be concerned    with the social impact of their activities. In addition  he helped facilitate    improved collaboration between MIT and the Technical University of Berlin. He    became professor emeritus in 1978.Dean of Engineering Thomas Magnanti noted that the Engineering Systems Division    and the recently established Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program follow    models established during Keil's tenure. "These programs  which are    broadening engineering education and research  are a testament to the visionary    thinking that characterized Alfred Keil's career " he said.Keil's honors and awards include two Navy Meritorious and Distinguished    Civilian Service Awards  the Coast Guard's Meritorious Public Service Award     the Gibbs Brothers Gold Medal Award from the National Academy of Sciences  the    Gold Medal Award of the American Society of Naval Engineers  the Lockheed Award    for Marine Science and Engineering  and the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit    of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was an active member of the National    Academy of Engineering  serving on its Committee on Ocean Engineering and the    Panel on Ocean Transportation  as well as several professional organziations.The Alfred A.H. Keil Fellowship in the School of Engineering was established    in 1989. In addition  MIT has established the Alfred A.H. Keil Ocean Engineering    Development Fund to support appropriate undergraduate and graduate students    and faculty. "The fund's objective is to perpetuate his basic principles    and life-long dedication to broad-based research in ocean engineering  with    special emphasis on related societal needs and concerns " said Chryssostomos    Chryssostomidis  director of the MIT Sea Grant Program and head of the Department    of Ocean Engineering.The book "Multiple Genius" by Dean A. Horn  published recently by    MIT Sea Grant Program Publications  chronicles Keil's life and career.    The Keils were longtime residents of Belmont.Dr. Keil is survived by his wife  Ursula (Leppelt) of Brookline; two sons     Juergen of Westerly  R.I.  executive director of the Naval Undersea Warfare    Center  and Michael of Bammengal  Germany; and two granddaughters  Kristen Keil    and Erika Keil  both of Boston.Memorial donations may be made to the Alfred A.H. Keil Ocean Engineering Development    Fund (MIT account number 3149100) and sent to the Department of Ocean Engineering     MIT Room 5-228  77 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139.

Gyorgy Kepes  founder of CAVS  dies at 95,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Gyorgy Kepes  the painter  designer  author and educator  who founded and directed the Center for Advanced Visual Studies  died on Dec.  29. A resident of Cambridge  he was 95."Gyorgy Kepes was the greatest pioneer in the marriage of art and technology  in America  if not the world. He was a visionary  a towering intellect and a breathtaking  artist. He single-handedly created the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT  and turned it into an internationally acclaimed program for the development of  the finest in late 20th-century art. His work will endure for many centuries to  come " said Alan Brody  associate provost for the arts.Born in Selyp  Hungary in 1906  Kepes studied painting at the School of Arts  in Budapest. The horrors of World War I convinced him that "only film could  bring into a single focus my joy in the visual world and the social goals to be  realized in this world " he wrote.In 1930 he went to Berlin  collaborating on film  stage and exhibitions  and  graphic design with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy  one of the principals in the Bauhaus movement.Kepes came to the United States in 1937 as head of the Light and Color Department  of the Institute of Design in Chicago  then known as the New Bauhaus. He joined  MIT in 1946 as associate professor of visual design  becoming a full professor  in 1949. He was appointed Institute Professor in 1970. Kepes founded the Center  for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in 1967 and served as its director until 1972.The director of CAVS  Stephen A. Benton  the E. Rudge and Nancy Allen Professor  of Media Arts and Sciences  said of Kepes  "He was one of the earliest faculty  to be brought to MIT to widen its historical mandate into the visual arts. He  was wonderfully articulate about the arts in general  as well as an important  contributor to them  and communicated especially well with the MIT culture."While World War I had convinced Kepes that some art forms were inadequate   World War II  he wrote  "virtually destroyed" his hope that any one  person acting alone "could marshal his inner strength to take constructive  action."Noting repeatedly the alienation of artists from scientific advances and scientists   from basic "issues of how to see and feel the quality of the world "  he sought ways to promote a sense of connectedness and belonging among them.Kepes' vision for CAVS took shape in the 1960s. A community composed of  both artists and scientists  he wrote  might be the way to "find some common  denominator between the landscape open to the artist and that which is open to  the scientist."Researchers at CAVS have pioneered the use of technologies such as lasers   plasma sculptures  sky art and holography as tools of expression in public and  environmental art.In addition to his career as an artist and an educator  Kepes was a prolific  author. He published "The Language of Vision " a summary of educational  ideals and methods  in 1944; "The New Landscape in Art and Science"  in 1956  and the seven-volume "Vision and Value" series in 1965 and  1966.Throughout his career  Kepes continued working as a designer  producing both  small and large-scale works. The First and Second Church in Boston commissioned  him to make stained glass windows  and he designed a window and all sculpture  for a church in Japan. His paintings are included in 30 permanent collections  including the Brooklyn Museum  the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and the  Whitney Museum in New York City.In 1995 the Hungarian government endowed a museum in Eger  Hungary  devoted  to housing a major collection of Kepes' paintings  drawings and photographs  as well as his archives. A permanent collection of his photographs is in Hungary's  National Photography Museum.The Kepes Prize is presented annually at MIT.Among many tributes  Kepes was awarded the Fine Arts Medal of the American  Institute of Arts and Letters. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts  and Letters and a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1996   he received both the Medal of Honor and the Middle Cross of the Republic of Hungary.Kepes met his wife  the late Juliet Appleby Kepes  in 1936. He is survived  by a son  Imre  of Pelham  Mass.; a daughter  Juliet Stone of Watertown; six grandchildren  and a great-grandchild.

Upon graduation  he conducted research and experimentation  on the physics and effects of underwater explosions.After World War II  he worked for the US Naval Technical Mission in Germany  in 1945-46 and came to the United States in 1947 to join the Navy's Bureau of  Ships. He was chief scientist of the Navy's Underwater Explosion Research Division  in Portsmouth  Va. for 12 years and became an authority on ship protection.In 1959  Dr. Keil became technical director of the Structural Mechanics Laboratory  at the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin in Washington  D.C. and was the first technical  director for the entire organization from 1963 to 1966. During this period  he  made extensive contributions to improving the structural integrity and survivability  of naval vessels.Dr. Keil came to MIT in 1966 as head of the Department of Naval Architecture  and Marine Engineering  now the Department of Ocean Engineering  the oldest academic  department of its kind in the country. Under his direction the department added  a graduate degree program in ocean engineering in 1967 and launched a joint-degree  program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1969.Not long after his arrival at MIT  Congress passed the National Sea Grant College  and Program Act. Recognizing the opportunity for MIT to benefit from participation  in this new marine program  Dr. Keil moved quickly and succeeded in obtaining  the first grant awarded by the new national program. His leadership led to the  establishment of the MIT Sea Grant Program in 1970. He was the program's first  director. In December 1976  MIT became the first private university in the nation  to be declared a Sea Grant College.Following his term as dean of engineering  Dr. Keil was named a Ford Professor  of Engineering. In that role  he continued to champion what he termed "the  wiser use of science and technology " urging engineers to be concerned with  the social impact of their activities. In addition  he helped facilitate improved  collaboration between MIT and the Technical University of Berlin. He became professor  emeritus in 1978.Dean of Engineering Thomas Magnanti noted that the Engineering Systems Division  and the recently established Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program (UPOP)  follow models established during Dr. Keil's tenure. "These programs   which are broadening engineering education and research  are a testament to the  visionary thinking that characterized Alfred Keil's career " Magnanti said.Dr. Keil was an active member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE)   serving on the Committee on Ocean Engineering and the Panel on Ocean Transportation.  He also was a member of the American Society of Naval Architects and Engineers   the American Physical Society  the Marine Technology Society  the American Society  for Engineering Education and the American Society of Naval Engineers.His honors and awards include two Navy Meritorious and Distinguished Civilian  Service Awards  the Coast Guard's Meritorious Public Service Award  the Gibbs  Brothers Gold Medal Award from the National Academy of Sciences  the Gold Medal  Award of the American Society of Naval Engineers  the Lockheed Award for Marine  Science and Engineering  and the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal  Republic of Germany.The Alfred A.H. Keil Fellowship in the School of Engineering was established  in 1989. In addition  MIT has established the Alfred A.H. Keil Ocean Engineering  Development Fund to support appropriate undergraduate and graduate students and  faculty. "The Fund's objective is to perpetuate his basic principles and  life-long dedication to broad-based research in Ocean Engineering  with special  emphasis on related societal needs and concerns " said Chryssostomos Chryssostomidis   director of the MIT Sea Grant Program.The book "Multiple Genius" by Dean A. Horn  published recently by  MIT Sea Grant Program Publications  chronicles the life and career of Dr. Keil.  The Keils were longtime residents of Belmont  Mass.Dr. Keil is survived by his wife  Ursula (Leppelt) of Brookline; two sons   Juergen of Westerly  R.I.  executive director of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center   and Michael of Bammengal  Germany; and two granddaughters  Kristen Keil and Erika  Keil  both of Boston. Donations in his memory may be made to the Alfred A.H.

Goldblith of food science and MIT Japan program dies at 82,Samuel A. Goldblith  a survivor of the Bataan Death March who became a professor of food science and technology and an advocate of business and educational cooperation between the United States and Japan  died at Kindred Hospital in Peabody on Dec. 28. The Melrose resident was 82.Paul E. Gray  professor of electrical engineering and former MIT president  said   "His love of life and family  his passion for service  his convictions about  the healing power of love and his boundless energy were an inspiration for me.  MIT is a better place because of Sam Goldblith."Steven R. Tannenbaum  the Underwood-Prescott Professor of Toxicology and co-director  of the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Health  was Goldblith's  student  colleague and friend."He led a remarkable life; he was a remarkable man " Tannenbaum said.  "During the war  he saved his own life and the lives of his men by squeezing  the juice out of grass to get vitamins. Back at MIT  he became a pioneer of bioengineering.  As an administrator  Goldblith was hugely successful in bringing together business  interests and academic interests  in raising money for MIT  and in establishing  the MIT Japan office."But the sum of the man went far beyond his astonishing range of achievements   Tannenbaum added. "Goldblith was a unique  generous  charismatic person   and a man of endless energy. We had to run to keep up with him. He had a loud  voice  a booming laugh  a huge store of jokes--mostly unrepeatable limericks--and  a nickname for everyone " he said. "He even had a regular table at Locke-Ober  restaurant in Boston. And if you ate with him  you knew--you didn't even  try to pay. He wouldn't allow it."A LIFE INTERRUPTEDBorn in Lawrence  Mass.  on May 5  1919  Goldblith received the S.B. from MIT  in 1940. It was a dream come true for his Russian immigrant father  Goldblith  wrote in his autobiography  "Appetite for Life" (1996).Goldblith would cling to that dream  to the strength of his family's religious  life and to his new marriage to Diana Greenberg throughout the harrowing half-decade  to come.In 1942  as a second lieutenant in the US Army Corps of Engineers  he became a  prisoner of war. Beginning with the grisly 60-mile death march across the Bataan  Peninsula in the Philippines  he spent more than three years in prison camps there  and on the "hell ships" used to transport prisoners to camps in Japan.Though he too almost starved  Goldblith  ever the scientist  studied the effects  of malnutrition-related diseases including beri-beri and hypoproteinemia on those  around him. His calculations on food and sanitation in POW camps were published  in the Office of Naval Research Reports in 1947.In one POW camp  he set up a method for calculating vitamin A deficiency by "measuring  the ability of volunteers to see a fixed-intensity light source through successively  thicker sheets of Japanese toilet tissue. Not a sophisticated test " he noted  wryly. "But at least it got published in Science."Goldblith was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Silver Star. In his autobiography   Goldblith credits his good luck  belief in God and others' kindness with  keeping him alive.Kenneth A. Smith  professor of chemical engineering and former vice president  for research at MIT  recalled that Goldblith did more than remember other people's  kindness; he repaid it loyally  remaining in lifelong contact with those who had  helped him survive the war.STUDENT  TEACHER  MENTORAfter the war  Goldblith resumed his studies at MIT in food technology  receiving  the S.M. in 1947 and the Ph.D. in 1949. He was a professor of food science and  technology from 1959-74.He was a leader in research into domestic uses of microwave ovens and in freeze-drying   which was essential to the US space program. He was author or co-author of more  than 250 articles in scientific journals and the editor or co-editor of six books  in the field of food science and technology.Goldblith's numerous awards and honors included the Distinguished Food Scientist  Award  and he served on several committees of the National Academy of Science's  National Research Council.But it was Goldblith's experience of the unique relationship between teacher  and student that forever changed his own life and life at MIT. His relationship  with Yaichi Ayukawa of Japan  his first graduate student  released the Bataan  survivor turned professor from the past.Goldblith and Ayukawa became lifelong friends. Together  they worked to open the  MIT Japan Office in 1976 and later collaborated in business.On his attitude toward Japan  Goldblith wrote  "It's not so much a matter  of forgiveness. It's whether you look to the past or you look to the future.  The difference is  if you look to the past  it's hate  and that brings on  war. If you look to the future  it's love  and that brings on peace."AMBASSADOR FOR US  MIT"Sam's loyalty to MIT was boundless " Gray said  noting Goldblith's  role as director in revitalizing and expanding the Industrial Liaison Program.  As vice president for resource development under Gray (1978-86)  "he was  instrumental in planning the 'Campaign for the Future' and in strengthening  the fund-raising capacity of the Institute."In 1984  to recognize his contribution to the advancement of food science and  promotion of friendly relations between America and Japan  Goldblith received  the Second Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan.  He is only the second non-Japanese person to receive the honor.The Samuel A. Goldblith Career Development Chair was established in 1993 and partially  funded by Ayukawa's family. The first holder of the chair was Professor Peter  Dedon; it is currently held by James L. Sherley  assistant professor in the Division  of Bioengineering and Environmental Health.In summarizing his life  Goldblith wrote  "I loved my wife  my family  my  country  my religion and my school (MIT)  which I tried to serve faithfully. I  served my country in war and peace by building bridges of understanding with Japan.  I was a scientist who understood business. I was lucky to become a vice president  of MIT. I hope that I did not disgrace my family in the job!"In his eulogy  Rabbi Thomas M. Alpert of Temple Tifereth Israel in Malden said   "There is a name in Hebrew for a person who has no time for hate. He is called  a tzaddik  a righteous one. That was Sam Goldblith."Goldblith is survived by a daughter and son-in-law  Judith and Richard Clark    of Melrose; a son  Jonathan of Frederick  Md.  and two granddaughters  Sarah    Clark and Rachel Happel. His wife  the former Diana Greenberg  died in 1990.    He was also the father of the late Errol D. Goldblith.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 9  2002.
Goldblith  MIT professor of food science  Bataan March survivor  dies,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Samuel A. Goldblith  a survivor of the Bataan Death March  who became a professor of food science and technology at MIT  a leader in the  field of food preservation and a tireless advocate of business and educational  cooperation between the US and Japan  died at Kindred Hospital in Peabody  Mass.   on December 28  2001. A resident of Melrose  Mass.  he was 82.Paul E.

He wouldn't  allow it."A LIFE INTERRUPTEDBorn in Lawrence  Mass.  on May 5  1919  Goldblith received the SB degree from  MIT in 1940. It was a dream come true for his father  an immigrant from Russia   Goldblith wrote in his autobiography  "Appetite for Life " published  in 1996.Goldblith would cling to that dream  to the strength of his family's religious  life and to his new marriage to Diana Greenberg throughout the harrowing half-decade  to come.In 1942  Goldblith  a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army Corps of Engineers  became  a prisoner of war.Beginning with the grisly 60-mile Death March across the Bataan Peninsula in  the Philippines  he spent more than three years in prison camps in the Philippines  and on the "Hell Ships" used to transport prisoners to camps in Japan.Though he  too  neared starvation  Goldblith  ever the scientist  continuously  studied the effects of malnutrition and its related diseases on those around him.In one POW camp  Goldblith set up a method for calculating vitamin A deficiency  by "measuring the ability of volunteers to see a fixed intensity light source  through successively thicker sheets of Japanese toilet tissue.

His definitive calculations on food and sanitation in POW camps  were published in the Office of Naval Research Reports in 1947.In his autobiography  Goldblith credits his good luck  belief in God  others'  kindness and an MIT chemistry class with keeping him alive.At one point  he recalled  he used iodine from his first aid kit to dose the  foul water in his canteen  thus avoiding "the scourge" of dysentery."I remembered from 5.01 that iodine  chlorine and bromine were in the  same section of the Periodic Table " he wrote.Goldblith was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Silver Star for his military service.  While he acknowledges these in his book  Goldblith typically devotes much more  attention to the help he received from others during the war years  carefully  listing their names and what they did.Kenneth A. Smith  professor of chemical engineering at MIT  recalled Goldblith  did more than remember others' kindness. He repaid it loyally.After the war  Goldblith and his wife returned often to the Philippines to  thank the Belgian Catholic nuns who had brought the POWs life-saving food and  medical supplies. The Goldbliths remained in close contact particularly with Sr.  Marie Arthur  visiting her and sending gifts  until her death in 1980.STUDENT  TEACHER  MENTORAfter the war  Goldblith resumed his studies at MIT in food technology  receiving  the SM degree in 1947 and the PhD in 1949. He was a professor of food science  and technology from 1959 to 1974.He was a leader in research into domestic uses of microwave ovens and in freeze-drying   which was essential to the US space program.Goldblith was author or co-author of over 250 articles in scientific journals  and the editor or co-editor of six books in the field of food science and technology.He received numerous awards and honors  including the Distinguished Food Scientist  Award  and he served on several committees of the National Academy of Science/National  Research Council. These included the Advisory Board on Military Personnel Supplies  from 1963-1971.But  in true MIT manner  it was Goldblith's experience of the unique relationship  between teacher and student that forever changed his own life and life at the  Institute.According to Tannenbaum  Goldblith was a respected mentor  one who inspired  loyalty and affection in his graduate students."I came to MIT to study metallurgy. I switched to food science because  of Goldblith. It was the best decision I ever made. A mentor is someone who guides  you through life  helping you make important personal and professional decisions.  Sam Goldblith selflessly gave people opportunities. He was tough  demanding and  helped others do their jobs better than they ever thought they could " Tannenbaum  said.Goldblith's experience as a mentor brought him face to face with the importance  of letting go of the past  sharply contrasting with his wartime experience  which  taught him to hang on to the past to survive.His relationship with Yaichi Ayukawa  his first graduate student  a young man  from Japan  provided a challenge to the Bataan survivor-turned-professor.The relationship was "a mechanism for Goldblith to get rid of the bitterness  of the war " said Tannenbaum.It worked superbly well. Ayukawa  whose thesis Goldblith supervised  became  a lifelong friend. Together  they worked to open the MIT Japan Office in 1976  and collaborated in business over the years.Goldblith commented that Ayukawa  who founded Techno- Venture Co.  Ltd.  and  whose father founded Nissan  was the "first venture capitalist in Japan."Reflecting on his goodwill toward Japan  Goldblith wrote  "It's not so  much a matter of forgiveness. It's whether you look to the past or you look to  the future. The difference is  if you look to the past  it's hate  and that brings  on war. If you look to the future  it's love  and that brings on peace."ADMINISTRATOR  AMBASSADOR"Sam's loyalty to MIT was boundless. He accepted appointment as Director  of the Industrial Liaison Program at a time when it was in decline (1974). He  was the first member of the faculty to serve in that program which was revitalized  and greatly expanded under his leadership. He proposed expanding the ILP to include  more European corporations and to open it to Japanese corporations. He created  the MIT ILP office in Japan and made MIT a genuine presence in that country. A  few years later  I asked him to serve a vice president for resource development.  In this capacity he was instrumental in planning the Campaign for the Future ('97-'02)  and in strengthening the fund-raising capacity of the Institute " Gray said.Goldblith served MIT as an administrator from 1974 until his retirement  travelling  extensively on behalf of MIT as well as for his own interests. He served as MIT's  vice president of resource development from 1978 to 1986.In 1984  in recognition of his contribution to the advancement of food science  and to the promotion of friendly relations between the US and Japan  Goldblith  received the The Second Class of the Order of the sacred Treasure from the Emperor  of Japan. He is only the second non-Japanese person to receive this high honor.The Samuel A. Goldblith Career Development Chair was established in 1993 and  partially funded by Ayukawa's family. Though Goldblith's student  Yaichi  had  died  his son and widow attended the ceremony at MIT in Goldblith's honor.The first holder of the Goldblith chair was Professor Peter Dedon of the department  of toxicology. It is currently held by James L. Sherley  assistant professor in  the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Health.Goldblith left his own modest summary of a remarkable life."I loved my wife  my family  my country  my religion  and my school (MIT)   which I tried to serve faithfully. I served my country in war and peace by building  bridges of understanding with Japan."I was a scientist who understood business. I was lucky to become a vice  president of MIT.

Alpert of Temple Tifereth Israel in Malden   said  "There is a name in Hebrew for a person who has no time for hate. He  is called a tzaddik  a righteous one." That was Sam Goldblith.Samuel Goldblith is survived by his daughter and son-in-law  Judith and Richard  Clark of Melrose  his son  Jonathan of Frederick  Maryland and two granddaughters   Sarah Clark and Rachel Happel. His wife  the former Diana Greenberg  died in 1990.  He was also the father of the late Errol D. Goldblith.

Peter Elias of computer science is dead at 78,Professor Emeritus Peter Elias  a pioneer in the field of computer science  died of Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease last Friday in the living room of his Cambridge home  surrounded by his family. He was 78 years old."Many of us will remember Peter as a quiet and unassuming colleague who contributed a great deal to education and research at MIT " said Victor W. Zue  director of the Laboratory for Computer Science. "He was one of the most energetic emeritus professors I know  coming to work almost every day and continuing to advise undergraduate students.""In addition to being a distinguished researcher and educator  Peter was one of MIT's great citizens " said Professor John V.

Kenneth Hale  linguist and activist for endangered languages  dies at 67,Kenneth Locke Hale  an MIT professor of linguistics known for his lifelong dedication to the study and preservation of endangered languages  died in his home in Lexington on Oct. 8. He was 67.Hale  who came to MIT in 1967  was internationally renowned for his ability to quickly learn and communicate in dozens of languages.Institute Professor Noam Chomsky  a colleague during the MIT years  responded "with inexpressible sadness and distress" to the news of Hale's death. "Ken Hale was a close and cherished friend for many years  a colleague whose contributions are incomparable and of immense intellectual distinction  and above all  a person of honor and courage who dedicated himself with passion and endless energy to protecting the rights of poor and suffering people throughout the world. One of the world's leading scholars  dear to countless people  he was also one of those very few people who truly merits the term 'a voice for the voiceless.' The loss is immeasurable " Chomsky said.Throughout his career  Hale sought to obtain training in linguistics for the native speakers of indigenous languages. He felt that the study and preservation of native languages should be conducted by members of the affected culture  in addition to outsiders. Two of his graduate students at MIT--Paul R. Platero  a Navajo  and LaVerne Masayesva Jeanne  a Hopi--are believed to be the first Native Americans to receive doctorates in linguistics.In a paper titled "The Human Value of Local Languages " Hale wrote  "The loss of local languages and of the cultural systems which they express has meant irretrievable loss of diverse and interesting intellectual wealth. Only with diversity can it be guaranteed that all avenues of human intellectual progress will be traveled."In an interview in 1995  Hale said "When you lose a language  a large part of the culture goes  too  because much of that culture is encoded in the language.""Ken viewed languages as if they were works of art. Every person who spoke a language was a curator of a masterpiece " said Samuel Jay Keyser  professor emeritus of linguistics and a close friend and colleague of Hale for more than 20 years. Keyser noted that Hale was one of the most significant linguists in the world and also a man of grace and humility who believed that speaking to a person in his or her own language was above all  an act of courtesy."Many people have that ability to gain near-native command of language  but few have Ken Hale's theoretical imagination. I was constantly mesmerized by his creativity " Keyser said.Philip S. Khoury  dean of the School of Humanities  Arts and Social Sciences  recalled Hale's expertise and good humor. "Ken Hale was a giant in linguistics and a great  compassionate human being. He had the ability to learn and speak languages by the dozens and he did. Once I asked him about this  and he said  'The problem is that many of the languages I've learned are extinct or close to extinction  and I have no one to speak them with!'" Khoury said.THEORETICAL INTERESTSHale's theoretical interests focused on the cross-linguistic study of language universals--he studied as many structurally diverse languages as possible in order to discover laws governing them all.Professor of Linguistics Sabine Iatridou  an MIT colleague and a former student of Hale  explained  "The idea is that if a particular phenomenon holds in a variety of languages  chances are it is reflection of what is called universal grammar--the properties of human language proper  not a result of accidental or historical reasons. A lot of theoretical linguistics relies on finding generalizations that hold across languages that are genetically unrelated."Over the course of his disciplined and devoted career  Hale contributed significantly to the development of a general theory of the human capacity for language  his colleagues agreed."Ken was the world's foremost cross-linguistic linguist. His knowledge of language and languages is legendary. So many of his hypotheses over the years had borne fruit--remarkable fruit  in fact " Iatridou said. "Many linguists working today do not realize how much of the theoretical background they are assuming had been initially proposed by Ken. However  beyond his immeasurable contributions to the field  which are easily quantifiable by looking at Ken's writings  his students and his overall influence  Ken's dedication and great part of his life's work was his love  care and help to people in need everywhere."A NEW HOME ON THE RANGEFollowing the sudden death of his grandfather when he was six  Hale's family moved from Chicago to a ranch in Canelo  Ariz  where his pursuits included trapping and gunsmithing. He attended grade school in a one-room schoolhouse that he reached on horseback each day.Hale's interests in language blossomed in 1948  when he was sent to the Verde Valley School in Sedona  Ariz. There  according to Keyser  "Ken first roomed with a Hopi boy and learned Hopi  then with a boy from Jemez and learned Jemez. He had to figure out a way to write the languages since there was no writing system for them."I learned faster by working on more than one language at a time " Hale said according to Keyser  moving on quickly in Tucson High School to studying Navajo  O'odam  Pachuco  Polish and "whatever else came along."With characteristic passion  Hale also enjoyed rodeo bull-riding. As an undergraduate at the University of Arizona  he divided his time between weekend "jackpot" rodeos and studying anthropology and Native American languages. In his senior year  he won the bull-riding event in the University of Arizona rodeo and wore the trophy belt buckle for the rest of his life.Hale received the B.A. in anthropology from the University of Arizona in 1955  the M.A. in linguistics from Indiana University at Bloomington in 1956 and the Ph.D. in linguistics from Indiana in 1958. From 1958-61  Hale conducted research under an NSF grant on Australian aboriginal languages. Before coming to MIT  he taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana (1961-64) and the University of Arizona (1964-66). He also taught a course on Walpiri literacy for Walpiri-speaking teachers in the Yuendumu School in Central Australia in 1974 and a course on Navajo linguistics in Kinlichee  Ariz.  in 1975.Starting in 1985  Hale made many trips to the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua to mentor native linguists in four indigenous languages of the region. During the last five summers of his life  Hale taught for and served on the board of directors of the Navajo Language Academy. He also was actively involved with the language revitalization project of the Wampanoag tribe in New England.Dr. Hale is survived by his wife  Sara Hale of Lexington; his brother  Stephen F. Hale of Tucson; and four sons: Whitaker of Arlington  Ian of Tucson  Caleb of Atlanta and Ezra of Lexington.A memorial for Professor Hale will be held at MIT on Thursday  Nov. 1 at 2 p.m. in Wong Auditorium.

Memorial service for Daniel Lewin scheduled for Thursday in Kresge,A memorial service for members of the Akamai and MIT communities only will be held Thursday  Sept. 20  at noon in Kresge Auditorium for Daniel M. Lewin  31  a rising star in the technology world who was a member of the Algorithms group at the Laboratory for Computer Science.Lewin  known for his role as a co-founder of Akamai Technologies  was killed on the American Airlines flight that crashed in New York on Tuesday. He was the chief technology officer at Akamai."It's not hard to make a huge laundry list of Danny's achievements  but I think what sets him apart is that he managed to combine high achievement with rock-solid personal qualities " said Eric Lehman of the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS)   one of his closest friends at MIT."Danny had a remarkable combination of creative insight  practical skill  and personal motivation " said Professor Stephen A. Ward  one of Lewin's graduate advisors. "His considerable impact on his field foreshadowed unimaginable future contributions  had his extraordinary career not been senselessly terminated. It is a great loss to his community  to his field and to the world."Lewin  born in Denver  Colo.  and raised in Jerusalem  was an officer in the Israel Defense Forces  a member of an elite anti-terrorism unit during his four years of active duty.Prior to coming to MIT  Lewin worked at IBM's research laboratory in Haifa  Israel  where he was a full-time research fellow and project leader in the area of circuit-design software. Simultaneously  he completed two undergraduate degrees  summa cum laude  at the Technion in Haifa  where he was named Outstanding Student in Computer Engineering in 1995. Lewin entered the Ph.D. program at MIT in 1996  studying applied mathematics under Professor F. Thomson Leighton.The story of Lewin's co-founding of Akamai Technologies with Leighton in 1998 has now become the stuff of legend. When Timothy Berners-Lee  founder of the World Wide Web  realized that congestion on the Internet was becoming an enormous problem  he issued a challenge to Leighton's research group to invent a better way to deliver Internet content. The result was a set of breakthrough algorithms that became the basis for Akamai.Lewin received the S.M. in electrical engineering and computer science in 1998. His master's thesis was the theoretical starting point for the company. It concerned storing copies of web content such as pictures or video clips at many different locations around the Internet so that one could always retrieve a nearby copy  making web pages load faster. The fruits of Lewin's labor are visible to the MIT community in the "www.akamaitech.com" that flashes for an instant at the bottom of every web browser.Akamai went public in October 1999  in a memorable initial public offering. Lewin  who was supporting a family that included two small children on a graduate school stipend at the time  suddenly found himself almost a billionaire. "It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy " said Lehman. "Even when he had no money he was probably the most generous person I've ever met. "Although Lewin was on a leave of absence from MIT  he expected to return to complete his studies at some point. "He loved the academic world  and teaching came naturally to him  " said Wendy P. Ziner  vice president of Akamai. "He taught all of us -- people in the industry  customers  employees -- and it was clear that he had a God-given talent."Around LCS  Lewin is remembered for the mathematical game of Theory Jeopardy  which he helped invent. Players would propose and solve problems  and a unique form of fun and craziness would ensue. Last spring Lewin threw a last round of the game -- a match between Akamai and LCS  with several hundred people in attendance.Lewin published and presented several breakthrough papers at top computer science conferences and received several awards  including the 1998 Morris Joseph Lewin Award for Best Masterworks Thesis Presentation at MIT. He was recently named one of the 25 most influential CTOs by InfoWorld.com  and ranked seventh in the Power 100 list of the Enterprise Systems Journal.Lewin is survived by his wife Ann of Brookline and his two sons.Contributions in his memory may be made to a fund to provide scholarships to students pursuing careers in science: the Daniel Lewin Science Scholarship Fund  c/o Hale and Dorr Capital Management LLC  60 State St.  Boston  MA 02019.
MIT colleagues attend funeral for Dertouzos,Ten MIT colleagues were among the mourners attending the Sept. 4 funeral services in Athens for Professor Michael L. Dertouzos  who died on Aug. 27 at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 64.Dertouzos  who had a rare gift for putting complicated technology into human terms and making it accessible to nontechnical audiences  was the longtime director of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). He was buried next to his parents at First Cemetery in Athens  where he was born and raised. Personal letters from MIT President Charles M. Vest and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were read at a dinner in Dertouzos' honor Tuesday night  sponsored by Athens College.The MIT delegation included LCS Associate Director Victor W. Zue  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Director Rodney A. Brooks  and Vice President for Resource Development Barbara W. Stowe  who represented President Vest. The group also included LCS research scientists and staff members Timothy J. Berners-Lee  Jean-Francois Abramatic  Lissa Natkin  Stephanie Seneff and Anne Wailes. They were joined by retired LCS Associate Director Albert Vezza and senior research scientist David Tennenhouse.A memorial service will be scheduled at MIT.Dertouzos joined the MIT faculty in 1964 and became director of LCS in 1974. Under his leadership  the lab became one of the largest research labs at MIT with 400 faculty members  graduate students and research staff. LCS dedicated itself to the invention  development and understanding of information technologies  always within the context of their human utility."We made a big mistake 300 years ago when we separated technology and humanism " Dertouzos said in an interview in Scientific American. "It's time to put the two back together."President Vest said  "Michael was larger than life. He was at once a leader  builder  visionary and caring human being. Few individuals have so personally and profoundly shaped their institutions and professional fields. Yet he did so in a manner that respected and involved all of his colleagues. I will miss his personal friendship and counsel very much.""Michael was a leader in every sense of the word " said John V. Guttag  head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). "He knew how to motivate people; he was passionate about his work and passionate about the people he worked with. For many of us  this is more like losing a family member than losing a colleague."LCS members and alumni have been instrumental in the development of numerous innovations  among them time-shared computers  RSA encryption  the X Window system  the ArpaNet and the Internet. Most recently  LCS spearheaded the $50 million Oxygen project in 1999 in conjunction with MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab. Oxygen is intended to make computers easier to use  "as natural a part of our environment as the air we breathe."Zue commented  "Michael fervently believed that developing technology is not enough by itself. One must also strive to demonstrate that it is good for something. Under his stewardship  LCS has been mindful of balancing technical excellence with social relevance." Zue has been named acting director of LCS (see story on page 1).The lab is currently the North American home of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  an open forum of companies and organizations that helps promote the Web's evolution and ensure its interoperability. Dertouzos was instrumental in bringing the W3C and its director  Tim Berners-Lee  inventor of the World Wide Web  to LCS.Berners-Lee said  "If it hadn't been for Michael  there would not probably have been a World Wide Web Consortium. He was a springof enthusiasm  capability  insight and experience which drove a half-formed idea of W3C into an international reality. Ever since  Michael's strength of leadership  clarity of thought and warmth of heart have been a constant support and nourishment and inspiration. He will be dearly missed."In the LCS director's statement  Dertouzos wrote with characteristic enthusiasm for human progress through technology: "We feel extraordinarily privileged to have a hand in shaping the Information Revolution--the third major socioeconomic movement of our world."But our quest goes beyond utilitarian increases in human productivity to the broader ways in which information can help people. We find ourselves in the junction of two interrelated challenges: going after the best  most exciting forefront technology  and ensuring that it truly serves human needs. It is this mixture of forefront technology and human utility that is the hallmark of LCS research."Professor Harold Abelson of EECS  who co-authored a paper with Dertouzos  said  "Michael was a leader of mythic proportions  both at MIT and worldwide. Much of what we take for granted in computing at MIT--including Project Athena and the World Wide Web Consortium--is a direct result of his leadership  his vision and his entrepreneurial skill." Dertouzos played a key role in creating Project Athena  which he suggested be named after the Greek goddess of wisdom.Stephen A. Ward  a professor of EECS at LCS and a former doctoral student of Dertouzos  said  "Michael Dertouzos brought a unique combination of intuition  humanity and style to our faculty. Michael's impact on MIT and his mentorship of students and colleagues stand as an indelible monument to his leadership  vision and personality. He will be remembered as one of the greats of MIT and computer technology."EARLY YEARSDertouzos  whose father was an admiral in the Greek navy and whose mother was a concert pianist  was raised in Greece. His earliest memories were of war-torn Athens and people starving in the streets  an experience that deeply affected him for the rest of his life.As a teenager  Dertouzos dreamed of going to MIT  but when he won a Fulbright scholarship it was to the University of Arkansas  where he earned the B.S. and M.S. degrees. After selling soft drinks and working with shaft-angle encoders at Baldwin Piano  he applied to the MIT doctorate program. Upon receiving the Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1964  he joined the faculty as an assistant professor and became a full professor in 1973.True to the MIT spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship  Dertouzos holds patents on a graphical display system  an incremental photoelectric encoder  a graphic tablet and a parallel thermal printer.PROLIFIC AUTHORDertouzos was the author of eight books. His latest  "The Unfinished Revolution: Human-Centered Computers and What They Can Do for Us" (Harper-Collins)  published this year  introduced the concept of "human-centered computing." Computers  he wrote  should serve people  not the other way around. Today's machines are overloaded with excessive features  inadequately address our needs  and demand too much of our attention  he declared."Michael argued eloquently for human-centered computing. He thought deeply about how information technology could help everyone  not just the technical elite " said Guttag.In the best-selling "What Will Be" (HarperCollins)  published in 1997 when the Internet was first beginning to take hold  he wrote about the many ways in which information technology would transform our lives.In 1986  Dertouzos was asked to chair the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity  to examine why US firms were losing competitiveness to their overseas industrial rivals. The result was "Made in America " co-authored by Richard K. Lester and Robert M. Solow (MIT Press)  which became one of the most influential business books of the 1980s  with more than 300 000 copies in print."Michael's books were one example of his educational skills. He was fearless in entering the arena of other pundits attempting to forecast the future of computers and their application. Among his colleagues he was known for his concern for the big picture " said Fernando J. Corbatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  professor emeritus of electrical engineering and the inventor of time-shared computing.AN EYE TO THE FUTUREAn avid sailor and woodworker  Dertouzos spent much of the past quarter-century studying and forecasting future technological shifts--in describing  for experts and ordinary citizens alike  what could be. In 1976  he predicted the emergence of a PC in every three to four homes by the mid-1990s. In 1980  he first wrote about the information marketplace  a vision of networked computers that has transformed the world economy.An eloquent speaker who was admired for his integrity and his disdain for hype  Dertouzos was frequently sought out by the media  industry and government agencies for his expertise and insight on the relationship between computers and their human users.During the Carter administration  he chaired a White House advisory group that redesigned the White House information systems. In 1995  he represented the United States in a delegation to the G7 Conference on the Information Society. In 1998  he was co-chairman of the World Economic Forum on the Network Society in Davos  Switzerland."Michael had a broad understanding of technology and a teacher's knack for explaining ideas. One direction in which this shone was his skill in interfacing with government sponsors of research. He was skillful in evoking the best research ideas from within the laboratory; he could educate without being condescending " Corbatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said.In his last interview  published in the August 22 issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education  Dertouzos spoke about the qualities that he most valued in teachers  qualities which were a fundamental part of his own approach to his interactions with the MIT community."Don't forget the impact that love has on education " Dertouzos said in explaining his skepticism of computer-based distance education. "If you are loved by your teacher--and I mean this in the most innocent and Platonic sense--if your teacher really cares for your well-being--and you know that because your teacher will ask about you  will scold you for not doing the right thing  and will give you stories about why you should do this or do that--the learning can be unbelievably different."Dertouzos  a resident of Weston  married Hadwig Gofferje in 1961. They divorced in 1993. In 1998 he married Catherine Liddell  who survives him along with his two children  Alexandra Dertouzos Rowe and Leonidas M.

In 1980  he first wrote about the Information Marketplace  a vision of networked computers that has transformed the world economy.An eloquent speaker  who was admired for his integrity and his disdain for hype  Dertouzos was frequently sought out by the media  industry and government agencies for his expertise and insight on the relationship between computers and their human users.During the Carter Administration  Professor Dertouzos chaired a White House advisory group that redesigned the White House information systems. In 1995  he represented the US in a delegation to the G7 Conference on the Information society. In 1998  he was co-chairman of the World Economic Forum on the Network Society in Davos  Switzerland."Michael had a broad understanding of technology and a teacher's knack for explaining ideas. One direction in which this shone was his skill in interfacing with government sponsors of research. He was skillful in evoking the best research ideas from within the laboratory; he could educate without being condescending " Corbatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said.In his final interview  printed in the August 22 issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education  Dertouzos spoke about the qualities that he most valued in teachers  qualities which were a fundamental part of his own approach to his interactions with the MIT community:"Don't forget the impact that love has on education " Dertouzos said in explaining his skepticism of computer-based distance education. "If you are loved by your teacher -- and I mean this in the most innocent and Platonic sense -- if your teacher really cares for your well-being -- and you know that because your teacher will ask about you  will scold you for not doing the right thing  and will give you stories about why you should do this or do that -- the learning can be unbelievably different."Dertouzos  a resident of Weston  married Hadwig Gofferje in 1961. They divorced in 1993. In 1998 he married Catherine Liddell  who survives him along with his two children  Alexandra Dertouzos Rowe and Leonidas M. Dertouzos of Boston  and a granddaughter  Kiera Ann Rowe.A funeral service will be held in Athens on September 4th  followed by a memorial service at MIT. In lieu of flowers  donations may be sent to Athens College  342 Madison Avenue  Suite 16161  New York  NY  10173.

Moakley's route to Congress went via Roxbury,Mel King  senior lecturer emeritus in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning and a former state representative from the South End and Roxbury  reflects on the political career of long-time Massachusetts Congressman Joe Moakley  who died May 28 of leukemia.I watch with interest and wonder the respect and admiration for the "people's representative " Joe Moakley. Interest -- in the way Bostonians have poured out in person and with words their feelings for and about his impact. Wonder -- are those same people  South Bostonians in particular and Bostonians in general  aware of the seeming contradiction in their behavior during the congressional primary in 1970 and election in 1972  and their posture now?There has been little recognition of how  in fact  he got elected. In the 1970 September primary  Joe Moakley won the South Boston wards 6 and 7 by 775 votes. However  Louise Day Hicks outpolled him across the city  gathering 24 000 votes to Moakley's 19 000 and David Nelson's 18 000 to capture the seat.An early indication of Moakley's growth and respect for the value of coalition and diversity and the long-range futility of racist-motivated politics was his recognition of David Nelson's effort. According to Hubie Jones  Moakley saw the vitality in Nelson's effort as one that stood on its own and did not detract from his effort.In the 1972 race  Moakley changed his tactics so he could broaden his base in the election by running as an independent. Bypassing the Democratic primary was a recognition that to win  he would have to reach out to a constituency that was not locked into the politics of divisiveness and blind parochial obedience to "you know where I stand."He lost South Boston wards 6 and 7 by 2 428 votes and the West Roxbury ward 20 by 4 500 votes. The difference  however  was made up in the Roxbury and Mattapan wards 12 and 14  where he outpolled Louise Day Hicks by 6 878 votes. With strong support from the African-American community  he narrowed the gap in Boston to 192 votes.The mobilization of that community  combined with the support in the districts outside the city  enabled him to win the 9th Congressional District seat.The evidence is clear that Moakley was not originally "the people's choice." And ironically  without the efforts of the African-American community  which was demonized by many Boston politicians  they wouldn't have had the leadership and service he provided over the years.In all the comments about his South Boston roots  what is neglected is that his stature rose when he took the route to Congress through Roxbury.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon June 6  2001.

Marine chemist John M. Edmond  pioneer in study of oceans  dies at 57,Professor John M. Edmond  a marine geochemist and paleoceanographer whose work on the oceanic carbon dioxide system contributed to breakthroughs in understanding the fate of fossil fuel carbon dioxide  died unexpectedly at home on April 10. Born in Glasgow  Scotland  and a member of the MIT faculty since 1970  he was 57.Professor Ronald Prinn  head of EAPS  said  "John Edmond was a major international figure in chemical oceanography over the past three decades. His studies of the chemical cycles in the world's oceans and in the major rivers that supply the oceans have been widely lauded. He will be missed but remembered fondly  by his MIT colleagues and students  and by the geochemistry community worldwide."EAPS Professor Edward A. Boyle said  "John Edmond combined a mighty intellect with enormous energy to explore the earth surface environment from the bottom of the ocean to the top of the highest plateau; from the heat of the tropics and hydrothermal vents to the cold of the Antarctic and the North Pole."Professor Edmond and his research group accomplished pioneering work on oceanic particulate matter  trace elements and radioisotopes. He participated in the discovery and geochemical exploration of hydrothermal systems at the mid-ocean ridges  and led research that illuminated the chemical composition of remote rivers and lakes such as Lakes Tanganyika and Baikal  and the Amazon  Orinoco  Siberian and Tibetan rivers. Professor Edmond had many research collaborators throughout the world."John combined a keen sense of what the important scientific questions were with careful and innovative chemical analyses and an adventurous spirit that took him all over the globe. He was brilliant  energetic  unselfish and inspiring to students and colleagues alike " Professor Prinn added.Professor Edmond's enthusiasm for scientific exploration generally and for marine geochemistry in particular shone through in his vivid commentary. In 1978  following the discovery of salt water rivers in the remote Andean highlands of Peru flowing through a region of salt domes en route to the Amazon River  he explained to a reporter  "Under the tremendous stresses of geological uplift  the salt can be squeezed like toothpaste through cracks and faults."In 1982  Professor Edmond concluded an expedition to study the Sea of Cortez in which he and his team discovered three fields of hot-water vents 6 500 feet below the surface. He described the vent chimneys as reminiscent of "Japanese pagodas with several roofs coming out of them. They are completely covered with large tube worms and thick mats of yellow-orange bacteria." Professor Edmond also described the smell of the site as "like putting your nose into a diesel oil tank."Francis Albarede  president of the European Association of Geochemistry said  "A scientist can be extremely proud if by the end of his life he had contributed one idea that changed the human perception of the world. John Edmond left us with several of these."Professor Edmond was a Fellow of the Royal Society and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). He was a recipient of AGU's Macelwane Medal  and he received the Harold Urey Medal from the European Association of Geochemistry and Geochemical Society. He served on the editorial boards for Earth and Planetary Science Letters  the Geochemical Journal (Japan) and Chemical Geology/Isotope Geochemistry. He also served on the RIDGE Steering Committee in the Geosciences and Astronomy division of the Royal Society.Professor Edmond received the BSc from the University of Glasgow in 1965 and the PhD in 1970 from the University of California in San Diego  where he studied at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.FRIEND AND MENTORAt MIT  Professor Edmond taught graduate courses in marine geochemistry and undergraduate seminars including "The Earth as a Chemical System."He was thesis advisor and colleague to Professor Boyle. "He was also an exceptionally kind and thoughtful person  one who wouldn't hesitate to help someone who needed it. His students thrived on the discussion and attention he gave them " Professor Boyle said."He spent a lot of time with his students  both in the lab in the field and also at dinners at his home. When he criticized  he did it in such a way that ultimately built up our confidence and ability and led us to successful academic careers."On a note of personal gratitude  Professor Boyle added  "My scientific career was jump-started by my graduate work with John; he had lots of good ideas and contacts  and he provided more opportunities and leads than I could ever find time to pursue. I can't begin to say how much he will be missed."In lieu of flowers  the Edmond family requests that donations be sent to the Pine Street Inn  a homeless shelter in Boston.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon April 25  2001.

Nobelist Clifford Shull is dead at 85,Professor Emeritus Clifford G. Shull  co-recipient of the 1994 Nobel Prize in physics  died on March 31 at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford following a brief illness. He was 85 and lived in Lexington.Professor Shull shared the Nobel Prize with Professor Bertram S. Brockhouse of McMaster University in Ontario."Clifford G. Shull has helped answer the question of where atoms 'are ' and Bertram N. Brockhouse the question of what atoms 'do '" the Nobel citation said.Professor Shull received the prize for his pioneering work in neutron scattering  a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material  like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.When a beam of neutrons is directed at a given material  the neutrons bounce off or are scattered by atoms in the sample being investigated. The neutrons' directions change depending on the location of the atoms they hit  and a diffraction pattern of the atoms' positions can then be obtained.Understanding where atoms are in a material and how they interact with one another is the key to understanding a material's properties."Then we can think of how we can make better window glass  better semiconductors  better microphones. All of these things go back to understanding the basic science behind their operation " Professor Shull  then 79  said on the day of the Nobel announcement.The Nobel citation noted that thousands of people now work in the field of neutron scattering  using the technology to study ceramic superconductors  the structure of viruses  surfaces of relevance to catalytic exhaust cleaning and more.University of Toronto President and former MIT Dean of Science Robert J. Birgeneau said of Professor Shull  "He was one of the leading solid state physicists of the 20th century as well as an outstanding educator. Even after retirement he continued to oversee his famous neutron diffraction experiment at the MIT reactor. Cliff's death represents a great loss to science  to MIT and to me personally."PHYSICS PIONEERProfessor Shull's pioneering work on neutron diffraction began about 50 years before he became a Nobel winner.He started in 1946 at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time  he said  "Scientists at Oak Ridge were very anxious to find real honest-to-goodness scientific uses for the information and technology that had been developed during the war at Oak Ridge and at other places associated with the wartime Manhattan Project."Professor Shull teamed up with the late Ernest Wollan  and for the next nine years they explored ways of using the neutrons produced by nuclear reactors to probe the atomic structure of materials.He said the most important problem he worked on at the time dealt with determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in materials."Hydrogen atoms are ubiquitous in all biological materials and in many other inorganic materials " Professor Shull once said  "but you couldn't see them with other techniques. With neutrons it turned out that that was completely different  and we were very pleased and happy to find that we could learn things about hydrogen-containing structures."As he refined the scattering technique  Professor Shull studied the fundamental properties of the neutron itself. He also initiated the first neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic materials. This yielded information about the magnetic properties of materials at the atomic level  opening up an entirely new field of study."If there is a 'central clearing house for thermal neutron physics' or a 'father of neutron scattering' in the United States  it is Professor Shull " wrote Professor Anthony Nunes (PhD 1969)  professor of physics at the University of Rhode Island  in a biographical article published in 1986. Professor Shull was Professor Nunes's thesis advisor at MIT.In his 1986 article published in Physica  Professor Nunes said Professor Shull's "abilities as an experimental physicist are amplified and extended by his completely candid relations with coworkers" who "find him to be modest to a fault. He is very careful to 'give credit where credit is due ' usually citing originators of ideas even in casual conversation."I consider the intellectual stimulation  the unending optimism and the simple scientific fun of my student years with this man to be priceless " concluded Professor Nunes.Professor Shull was the fourth member of the MIT physics faculty to receive the Nobel Prize in physics and the 15th present or formerfaculty member to receive a Nobel Prize. One staff member and 11 alumni also have won Nobels.He came to MIT as a full professor in 1955 and retired in 1986.Professor Shull's awards include the Buckley Prize  which he received from the American Physical Society in 1956  and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1956) and the National Academy of Sciences (1975). In 1993 he received the Royal SwedishAcademy of Sciences' Gregori Aminoff prize for his "development and application of neutron diffraction methods for studies of atomic and magnetic structures of solids."Born in Pittsburgh in 1915  Professor Shull received the BS from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1937. He entered Carnegie Tech to study aeronautical engineering  but after six months found himself drawn to physics. He received the PhD from New York University in 1941.He was a teaching assistant at NYU from 1937-41  a research physicist with the Texas Company (now Texaco) in Beacon  NY  from 1941-46  and a research physicist at Oak Ridge from 1946-55.His hobbies included stamp collecting  camping  hiking  coin collecting  model trains and golf  said his son  Robert D. Shull (SB 1968).Professor Shull is survived by his wife of 60 years  Martha-Nuel Summer; three sons  John  Robert and William; and five grandchildren. One grandson  Craig M. Shull  received the SB in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1996.A memorial service for Professor Shull will be held on Friday  April 6 from 1:30-3pm in the MIT Chapel  with a reception in the Physics Reading Room (26-152) from 3-4pm.

Shannon  father of digital communications  is dead at 84,Professor Emeritus Claude E. Shannon  known as the father of modern digital communications and information theory  died February 24 at the Courtyard Nursing Care Center in Medford after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was 84 years old.Professor Shannon  a distant relative of Thomas Edison  was affiliated with Bell Laboratories from 1941-72  during which time he wrote the landmark A Mathematical Theory of Communication (1948). This pioneering paper on information theory begins by observing that "the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."The information content of a message  he theorized  consists simply of the number of 1s and 0s it takes to transmit it. "Nobody had come close to this idea before " said MIT Professor Emeritus Robert G. Gallager  who worked with Professor Shannon. "This was not something somebody else would have done for a very long time."The revolutionary idea was gradually adopted by communications engineers and stimulated the technology which led to today's information age. All communication lines today are measured in bits per second  the notion that Professor Shannon made precise with "channel capacity." His theory also made it possible to use bits in computer storage needed for pictures  voice streams and other data.After receiving BS degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1936  he came to MIT as a graduate student. As a part-time job  he worked on Professor Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer. His master's thesis  "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits " used Boolean algebra -- in which problems are solved by manipulating two symbols  1 and 0 -- to establish the theoretical underpinnings of digital circuits. This work was the beginning of modern switching theory. Harvard University Professor Howard Gardner called it "possibly the most important  and also the most famous  master's thesis of the century."He received the SM in electrical engineering and the PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940. To satisfy the language requirement  he had to hire tutors in French and Spanish and worked repeatedly with stacks of flash cards. He had to take the German exam twice. Upon graduation  he became a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  NJ and joined Bell Laboratories in New Jersey in 1941.During World War II  Dr. Shannon  a noted cryptographer  worked on secrecy systems at Bell Labs. His team's work on antiaircraft directors -- devices that observe enemy planes or missiles and calculate the aim of countermissiles -- became crucial when German rockets were used in the blitz of England. His 1949 paper entitled "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" is generally credited with transforming cryptography from an art to a science.While at Bell Labs  he met Mary Elizabeth "Betty" Moore  a numerical analyst  whom he married in 1949. In 1956  Dr. Shannon became a visiting professor at MIT and the family settled on Mystic Lake in Winchester. He was MIT's Donnor Professor of Science from 1958-78  when he became professor emeritus.Born in Petoskey  MI  on April 30  1916  Professor Shannon grew up in Gaylord  MI  and worked as a messenger for Western Union while in Gaylord High School. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi.WHIMSICAL INVENTIONSProfessor Shannon had a whimsical side and developed a juggling machine  rocket-powered Frisbees  motorized Pogo sticks  a mind-reading machine  a mechanical mouse that could navigate a maze and a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle. At Bell  he was remembered for riding the halls on a unicycle while juggling three balls.An avid chess player  Professor Shannon built a chess-playing computer years before IBM's Deep Blue came along. While on a trip to Russia in 1965  he challenged world champion Mikhail Botvinnik to a match. He lost in 42 moves  considered an excellent showing.Among his numerous awards were the National Medal of Science (1966)  the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Medal of Honor (1966)  and the Kyoto Prize for Basic Science (1985). He was a member of the American Philosophical Society  the National Academy of Sciences  the Royal Society of London and the Leopoldina Academy.Professor Shannon received honorary degrees from Yale  Michigan  Princeton  the University of Edinburgh  the University of Pittsburgh  Northwestern  Oxford  the University of East Anglia  Carnegie-Mellon  Tufts and the University of Pennsylvania.In addition to his wife  Professor Shannon is survived by a son  Andrew Moore Shannon of Brookline; a daughter  Margarita (Peggy) Shannon of Cambridge; a sister  Catherine S. Kay of Benton  KY  and two granddaughters. Services and burial are private.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon February 28  2001.

As a part-time job  he worked on Professor Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer. His master's thesis  "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits " used Boolean algebra--in which problems are solved by manipulating two symbols  1 and 0--to establish the theoretical underpinnings of digital circuits. This work was the beginning of modern switching theory. Harvard University Professor Howard Gardner called it "possibly the most important  and also the most famous  master's thesis of the century."He received the SM in electrical engineering and the PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940. To satisfy the language requirement  he had to hire tutors in French and Spanish and worked repeatedly with stacks of flash cards. He had to take the German exam twice. Upon graduation  he became a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  New Jersey  and joined Bell Laboratories in New Jersey in 1941.During World War II  Dr. Shannon  a noted cryptographer  worked on secrecy systems at Bell Labs. His team's work on anti-aircraft directors--devices that observe enemy planes or missiles and calculate the aim of counter missiles--became crucial when German rockets were used in the blitz of England. His 1949 paper entitled "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" is generally credited with transforming cryptography from an art to a science.While at Bell Labs  he met Mary Elizabeth "Betty" Moore  a numerical analyst  whom he married in 1949. In 1956  Dr. Shannon became a visiting professor at MIT and the family settled on Mystic Lake in Winchester  Mass. He was MIT's Donnor Professor of Science from 1958-78  when he became professor emeritus.Born in Petoskey  Mich.  on April 30  1916  Professor Shannon grew up in Gaylord  Mich.  and worked as a messenger for Western Union while in Gaylord High School. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi.Professor Shannon had a whimsical side and developed a juggling machine  rocket-powered Frisbees  motorized Pogo sticks  a mind-reading machine  a mechanical mouse that could navigate a maze and a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle. At Bell  he was remembered for riding the halls on a unicycle while juggling three balls.An avid chess player  Professor Shannon built a chess-playing computer years before IBM's Deep Blue came along. While on a trip to Russia in 1965  he challenged world champion Mikhail Botvinnik to a match. He lost in 42 moves  considered an excellent showing.Among his numerous awards were the National Medal of Science (1966)  the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Medal of Honor (1966)  and the Kyoto Prize for Basic Science (1985). He was a member of the American Philosophical Society  the National Academy of Sciences  the Royal Society of London and the Leopoldina Academy.Professor Shannon received honorary degrees from Yale  Michigan  Princeton  the University of Edinburgh  the University of Pittsburgh  Northwestern  Oxford  the University of East Anglia  Carnegie-Mellon  Tufts and the University of Pennsylvania.In addition to his wife  Professor Shannon is survived by a son  Andrew Moore Shannon of Brookline  Mass.; a daughter  Margarita (Peggy) Shannon of Cambridge  Mass.; a sister  Catherine S. Kay of Benton  Ky.  and two granddaughters. Services and burial are private.
Lee  founder of CQM  dies at 77,A memorial service will be held at MIT this Saturday  Feb. 17 for Professor Emeritus Thomas H. Lee  a founder of the Center for Quality Management (CQM) who was a pioneer in developing modern management techniques. He died on February 4 in Massachusetts General Hospital at age 77 after a brief illness. The service is scheduled for 2pm in the Tang Center's Wong Auditorium.Professor Lee  an employee of General Electric Co. in his native Shanghai  was undergoing training in the United States when the Communist takeover of China occurred. He and his wife chose to stay here and Professor Lee worked for GE in the United States for 30 years  earning an MS in electrical engineering from Union College in 1950 and a PhD from Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute in 1954.He came to MIT as a visiting research scientist in 1979 and joined the electrical engineering faculty the following year. He became the Philip Sporn Professor of Energy Processing in 1982. He was also the director of the Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems and associate director of the Energy Laboratory. He was appointed director of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna in 1984.Professor Gerald L. Wilson  former dean of the School of Engineering  invited Professor Lee to join the faculty  hoping his ability to meld strategic thinking with technology would provide a new perspective. He did."Tom was a truly wonderful colleague " said Professor Wilson. "He was inevitably enthusiastic  often calling his colleagues at home with another new idea or concept. He made hundreds of friends in the Boston area and later worldwide due to his interest in learning about better management techniques and his great desire to share them with others. I don't think Tom ever stopped having fun."Professor Edward Roberts  co-chair with Professor Lee of the Sloan School Management of Technology (MOT) program  said  "Tom Lee's insights into engineering and technology management and enthusiasm for the program's goals were instrumental to the MOT program's growth and success. He was a caring developer of both curricula and students."Professor Lee joined CEOs and senior managers from seven greater Boston companies to found the CQM in 1989  a year after he retired from MIT. Other founders included Alexander V. d'Arbeloff  chair of the MIT Corporation  and Raymond S. Stata  a life member of the Corporation.Mr. D'Arbeloff  a founder and former CEO of Teradyne Inc.  said  "Tom Lee was a visionary who realized in the late 1980s that US industry was behind Japan in the ability to deliver consistently excellent implementation in engineering and manufacturing. Tom wanted to bring to the Boston area (and beyond) proven methodology for application in local companies. Along with Ray Stata  he formed the CQM and succeeded way beyond his initial ambition. I owe a lot to Tom personally and on behalf of Teradyne."Mr. Stata  a founder of Analog Devices  said  "As the founder and spiritual leader of CQM  Tom brought together business practitioners and management thought leaders with the vision of integrating their ideas and best practices into a management system that would help organization leaders around the world achieve and sustain the highest levels of performance. In each of his distinct careers as inventor  chief scientist of GE  professor at MIT and management guru  Tom rose to the top ranks  always pushing the envelope  always searching for ways to make the world a different and better place... right up to the last day of his life."Professor Joel Moses  a former dean of the School of Engineering  said  "Tom's role in the Center for Quality Management helped American industry successfully cope with the Japanese challenge to American manufacturing. The center's Cambridge location also gave MIT faculty and staff great opportunities to learn from and influence these important changes in American product design and manufacturing processes."Professor Lee was president of CQM from 1990-98 and served on its board of directors. During this period  he worked with members to define the facets of an integrated management system. With Shoji Shiba and Robert Chapman Wood  he co-authored Integrated Management Systems: A Practical Approach to Transforming Organizations (John Wiley & Sons  1999). He became president emeritus of CQM in 1998.For the past three years  he studied worldwide anticorruption tactics with Transparency International. He was also instrumental in organizing CQM's new chapter in Shanghai  where he was born on May 11  1923.Professor Lee earned the BS in mechanical engineering in 1946 from Chiao Tung University and served in the Republic of China Army before joining GE in Shanghai. He was the pan-Asia doubles champion in table tennis while in college.Professor Lee is survived by his wife  Kin Ping  of Boston and West Tisbury; three sons  William of Wellesley  Thomas Jr. of Milton and Richard of Weston; and eight grandchildren.Donations in his memory may be made to the Chiao Tung University Alumni Association of America  2 World Trade Center  Rm 1844  New York  NY 10048  Attn: Liang J.

Dorothy Bowe dies at 71; aided MIT women,Dorothy L. Bowe  71  of Medford  former associate director of Financial Aid  died on February 9 following a struggle with bone cancer.Ms. Bowe came to the Institute in 1950  starting as secretary to Professor John Norton in what is now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. In the early 1960s  she became secretary to Dean Emily L. Wick just as MIT made a commitment to increase the number of women students. The two of them championed not only boosting female enrollment but also making MIT a more hospitable place for women in general. As part of that effort  she supported the Association of MIT Alumnae (AMITA) in launching a vigorous recruiting network for new women students.Ms. Bowe also led the effort of the Women's Independent Living Group (WILG) to establish its residence. Later she was involved with gathering the oral and written history of women at MIT  and fund-raising for the Ellen Swallow Richards Professorship  named for the first woman to graduate from MIT. The Alumni Association selected her as an honorary alumna of MIT in 1984.Her interest in women extended to the employees of MIT as well. She worked to increase their numbers in administrative staff positions and for the inclusion of everyone in the MIT Directory. She was also a longtime member of the board of directors of the Quarter Century Club."She was a friend all of us could count on  and she was a real supporter of women of all ages in the MIT community " said Priscilla Gray  wife of former MIT President Paul Gray and a force behind the Public Service Center and the Women's League."In the succession of administrators committed to equal opportunity for women  Dotty Bowe was an inspiring figure for many " said Mary Rowe  a special assistant to the president  ombudsperson and adjunct professor of management. "She cared about support staff women and undergraduates  about staff women and faculty  about women of color  about graduate students and alumnae and former employees."After taking early retirement  Ms. Bowe and Walter L. Milne were asked to investigate how to reach out to MIT's retired population of about 3 000 to keep them involved with the Institute. They formed the Association of MIT Retirees in 1994. The organization now has an active membership of some 600 and offers a program of seminars and trips open to all retirees.Ms. Bowe is survived by her husband  Gerald  and many nieces  nephews and cousins.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon February 14  2001.

Greece's ambassador to the United States  Alexander Philon  has also been invited.Constantine Giannitsis  29  was stabbed to death and robbed of $8 in cash as well as traveler's checks  credit cards and his passport while on vacation in Taxco  Mexico  on December 31. Mexican police arrested three teenagers on January 3.Dr. Giannitsis completed his thesis in the fall and was scheduled to receive his PhD in earth  atmospheric and planetary sciences on February 21. His thesis adviser was Professor Richard Lindzen.In addition to sharing recollections of Dr. Giannitsis at the service  his friends are creating a collage of photographs and memories that will be presented to his parents. In the January 10 Tech Talk  it was erroneously reported that the service would take place in February.For information on the service  call the International Students Office at x3-3705.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 24  2001.
Postdoc killed during robbery in Mexico,A memorial service will be held at MIT on January 27 for post doctoral associate Constantine Giannitsis  who was stabbed to death and robbed of $8 in cash  traveler's checks  credit cards and his passport while on vacation in Taxco  Mexico.The Greek Embassy in Washington said Mexican police arrested and charged three teenagers -- ages 15  16 and 17 -- last Wednesday after surrounding their house. The Associated Press reported that a knife was also seized.The embassy said Dr. Giannitsis  29  was taking photographs in an alley in the historical section of the city when the youths confronted him at about 3:30pm on December 31. Dr. Giannitsis scuffled with the assailants and was stabbed in the chest  near his heart. He made his way out of the alley to the sidewalk  where he collapsed.Husband and wife physicians from San Antonio  TX  sightseeing with a niece  a nephew and their three small children  discovered Dr. Giannitsis in the street  still alive but bleeding profusely  his lungs collapsed. Moises Bucay  a cardiologist  tended to Dr. Giannitsis at the scene. "You can't turn away when you see something like that " said his wife  Vivian  a dermatologist  who went through Dr. Giannitsis's wallet and discovered an MIT identification card  a Massachusetts ID that said he was a Greek citizen  and his health insurance card.Moises Bucay rode to the hospital in an ambulance with Dr. Giannitsis  who was pronounced dead a short time later.Dr. Giannitsis completed his thesis in the fall and was scheduled to receive his PhD in earth  atmospheric and planetary sciences (EAPS) on February 21. His father  Anastassios Giannitsis  is Greece's Minister of Labor and Social Affairs and a professor of economics at the University of Athens. He immediately went to Mexico when he learned of his son's death.The embassy said Constantine Giannitsis and a friend were en route from Mexico City to Acapulco when they stopped to visit Taxco  a picturesque resort area. The friends had parted during their sightseeing and Dr. Giannitsis was alone when he was attacked.The MIT memorial for Dr. Giannitsis is scheduled for Saturday  Jan. 27 from 4-6pm at the MIT Chapel. Contact the International Students Office at x3-3795 for details."Constantine was a wonderfully kind and engaging individual  passionate about so many things " said Associate Dean for Graduate Students Danielle Guichard-Ashbrook  acting director of the ISO. "He would frequently stop by the International Office  just to chat casually with staff members about his many interests -- filmmaking  politics  travel. I know that his academic endeavors here brought him much joy  but he loved participating in the social life of the community as well. Our deepest sympathies go to his family in Greece and to his many friends and colleagues here at MIT."His friends and fellow graduate students remember Dr. Giannitsis as a scientist who combined keen physical insight and superior mathematical skills. He also had a wide variety of interests -- movies  politics  sports  photography  cooking -- and enjoyed the cosmopolitan lifestyle at MIT and in Boston.Postdoctoral associate Jeff Scott of EAPS and Dr. Giannitsis came to MIT at the same time. They shared an office for six and a half years and became good friends."Constantine was the rare combination of someone who worked extremely hard and was extremely bright " Dr. Scott recalled. "He helped me immensely during our early years  as his background in math and physics (and ability) was superior to mine  and he never got tired of answering my questions. He was confident and self-assured  but was also willing to laugh at himself. I think if he could see me writing such effusive praise for him  he would just roll his eyes  but I really haven't exaggerated. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."Gerard Roe and Nili Harnik also knew Dr. Giannitsis for more than six years. Both were graduate assistants with him under Professor Richard Lindzen  who was Dr. Giannitsis's thesis advisor. They said jointly: "It took a while for Constantine to get used to MIT and for MIT to get used to Constantine. Always in search of a good argument  he relished taking a strong opinion on almost any topic. But with a relaxed demeanor  and an engaging and generous sense of humor  he made and kept many good friends in the department. He loved the diversity of the department  and it seemed rare that he was not talking to foreign students in their native language."No words are ever adequate to sum up a life. But I think that for those who knew Constantine  he will live on in the memories of a hundred different moments. We are fortunate to be enriched by his having touched our lives."Dr. Giannitsis was a member of the Hellenic Students Association and sponsored a 1999 concert of Cuban music. He was a gifted photographer and an active participant in demonstrations protesting atrocities against the Serbian people in 1999."Unfortunately  we tend too often to forget how precious a human life is " said Aleksandar Kojic  president of the MIT Organization of Serbian Students from 1999-2000. "I remember Constantine as being a quiet  modest and humble person  possessing the age-old qualities almost forgotten in today's world. Yet in showing that actions speak louder than any words  he was always there to lend help and support in difficult times. He was indeed a hero and a true friend."Dr. Giannitsis came to MIT in 1994 after he received his undergraduate degree from the University of Athens. He defended his thesis  "Non-Linear Saturation of Vertically Propagating Rossby Waves " on September 14. He planned to return to Greece in June to join the army to fulfill his military obligation. Dr. Giannitsis was born in West Berlin  Germany  on June 19  1971  and raised in Kifissia  Greece.In addition to his father  he is survived by his mother  Anna  and a younger brother  Andreas. His father  who arrived in Mexico on January 2  returned to Greece with his son's body last Thursday. A funeral service was held in Athens on Friday.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 10  2001.
Renowned nuclear physicist Feshbach  Institute Professor emeritus  dies at 83,Institute Professor Emeritus Herman Feshbach of Cambridge  a renowned nuclear physicist and champion of equal opportunity at MIT and around the world  died December 22 of congestive heart failure at Youville Hospital in Cambridge. He was 83.Professor Feshbach served on the faculty of the Department of Physics for more than 50 years and was department chairman for 10 years beginning in 1973. He also directed the Center for Theoretical Physics (which he helped create) from 1967-73. He won many awards  including the National Medal of Science in 1986.Professor Feshbach worked to open communications between western and Soviet scientists during the height of the Cold War and championed the cause of "refuseniks" including physicist Andrei Sakharov. He first met Sakharov in the mid-1970s and wrote a piece in Physics Today about visiting him in Moscow after Sakharov's return from exile in Gorky in 1987. Professor Feshbach was also active in the antinuclear movement and helped found the Union of Concerned Scientists  serving as its first chairman.A native of New York  NY  Professor Feshbach received the BS from the City College of New York in 1937 and then came to MIT for graduate study  subsequently remaining here for his entire career. He became an instructor in physics in 1941 and received the PhD in 1942. He was appointed to the faculty as an assistant professor in 1945  later becoming an associate professor in 1947 and full professor in 1955. Professor Feshbach was named an Institute Professor  MIT's highest faculty honor  in 1983. He retired in 1987.Colleagues called Professor Feshbach one of the world's greatest theoretical nuclear physicists. He led the development of nuclear reaction theory and contributed significantly to the statistical description of nuclear states and reactions  as well as contributing to the understanding of the structure of nuclei  which was important for many applications including nuclear medicine and nuclear power. He co-authored two seminal textbooks  Methods of Theoretical Physics (1953) with Phillip M. Morse and Theoretical Nuclear Physics with Amos deShalit.Professor Feshbach was also a vigorous advocate of scientific freedom and opportunity. "He was profoundly disturbed by the military application of nuclear physics and worked to rein in the darker side of scientific research " said Professor of Physics Robert L. Jaffe. He took part in a 1969 protest of military research at MIT  and in 1992  an ad hoc committee studying the "Military Impact on Campus Research" chaired by Professor Feshbach submitted a report saying that a "policy of openness" should govern research at MIT.Professor Feshbach strove to increase the number of women and minority faculty members at MIT. He chaired the faculty's Equal Opportunity Committee  which made recommendations in 1991 for recruiting more women faculty members."He was an extremely smart  very friendly man  but he also had a toughness about him. He helped many of us start our careers  and was always straightforward and very thoughtful " Professor Marc A. Kastner  head of the physics department  told the Boston Globe.As head of the physics department  "Herman was as dogged in his defense of fundamental physics as he was kind in his mentoring of younger colleagues " said Professor Jaffe. "The corridors of Building 6 resonated to his laughter and his animated defense of principles of physics or politics for nearly 60 years."The Department of Physics inaugurated the annual Herman Feshbach Lectures in 1984  honoring him for his distinguished career and service to the department. The Herman Feshbach Professorship was created in 1999 to support theoretical physicists.Professor Feshbach was a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1969 and headed the physics section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1987. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1980-81 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1982-86. Professor Feshbach served on several government and professional committees and was a consultant to the Brookhaven  Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories  as well as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. He was also the longtime editor of the journal Annals of Physics.Professor Feshbach leaves his wife  Sylvia (Harris); a daughter  Carolyn of Lexington; two sons  Theodore of Hopedale and Mark of Minneapolis; a sister  Florence Nadelman of Cranford  NJ; two brothers  Bernard of Palo Alto  CA and Sidney of Amherst; and two grandchildren.A funeral was held on December 27 in Stanetsky Memorial Chapels in Brookline.

Lily Kay  53  life sciences historian,Dr. Lily E. Kay  a visiting scholar in the Program in Science  Technology  and Society (STS) and one of the outstanding historians of biology of her generation  died on December 18 of cancer.Dr. Kay's work drew from multiple disciplines to understand science in its many social and cultural dimensions. Her most recentbook  Who Wrote the Book of Life? (Stanford University Press  1999)  traced the efforts of biologists  biochemists and information scientists to explain the genome as an information system written in DNA code. Dr. Kay showed how the "code" is not really a code and thus why cryptoanalytic techniques failed  and how the genetic "code" was eventually broken instead by biochemists who only reluctantly translated their work into the metaphor of code because that language had become the only way to get a hearing.Her earlier book  The Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech  the Rockefeller Foundation and the Rise of the New Biology  has become a classic account. When it first appeared  it too was controversial but also received accolades from scientists such as Joshua Lederberg and Linus Pauling. Her views were always sharply argued  holding to account both extreme biologial reductionism and legacies of eugenicist views in contemporary biology.Born in Krakow  Poland in 1947 to concentration camp survivors  Dr. Kay moved with her parents to Israel and then came to the United States in 1960. After she graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1969  she taught high school physics in Pittsburgh and was a research associate in biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh from 1974-77. In 1977 she became a senior research assistant at the Salk Institute in La Jolla  CA  working on the molecular biology of viruses. She earned a PhD in the history of science from Johns Hopkins University in 1986.After two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia  she joined the history of science faculty at the University of Chicago  and in 1989 she began an eight-year stint on MIT's faculty in STS  which had just established a new PhD program. In recent years  she worked as an independent scholar  with guest appointments at Harvard University and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin.When she died  Dr. Kay was working on a book on the MIT neuroscientist Warren S. McCulloch and the fields of research he helped spawn: serial computing  artificial intelligence and models of brain function.A funeral was held on December 21 at the Levine Chapels in Brookline. Survivors include relatives Kurt and Paulette Olden of New York City  and three former husbands. Donations in her memory may be made to the American Cancer Society  20 Speen St.  Framingham  MA 01701.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 10  2001.
Herman Feshbach  renowned physicist  is dead at 83,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Institute Professor Emeritus Herman Feshbach of Cambridge  a renowned nuclear physicist and champion of equal opportunity at MIT and around the world  died December 22 of congestive heart failure at Youville Hospital in Cambridge. He was 83.Professor Feshbach served on the faculty of the Department of Physics for more than 50 years and was department chairman for 10 years beginning in 1973. He also directed the Center for Theoretical Physics (which he also helped create) from 1967-73. He won many awards  including the National Medal of Science in 1986.Professor Feshbach worked to open communications between western and Soviet scientists during the height of the Cold War and championed the cause of "refuseniks" including physicist Andrei Sakharov. He first met Sakharov in the mid-1970s and wrote a piece in Physics Today about visiting him in Moscow after Sakharov's return from exile in Gorky in 1987. Professor Feshbach was also active in the antinuclear movement and helped found the Union of Concerned Scientists  serving as its first chairman.A native of New York  NY  Professor Feshbach received the BS from the City College of New York in 1937 and then came to MIT for graduate study  subsequently remaining here for his entire career. He became an instructor in physics in 1941 and received the PhD in 1942. He was appointed to the faculty as an assistant professor in 1945  later becoming an associate professor in 1947 and full professor in 1955. Professor Feshbach was named an Institute Professor  MIT's highest faculty honor  in 1983. He retired in 1987.Colleagues called Professor Feshbach one of the world's greatest theoretical nuclear physicists. He led the development of nuclear reaction theory and contributed significantly to the statistical description of nuclear states and reactions  as well as contributing to the understanding of the structure of nuclei  which was important for many applications including nuclear medicine and nuclear power. He co-authored two seminal textbooks  Methods of Theoretical Physics (1953) with Phillip M. Morse and Theoretical Nuclear Physics with Amos deShalit.Professor Feshbach was also a vigorous advocate of scientific freedom and opportunity. "He was profoundly disturbed by the military application of nuclear physics and worked to rein in the darker side of scientific research " said Professor of Physics Robert L. Jaffe. He took part in a 1969 protest of military research at MIT  and in 1992  an ad hoc committee studying the "Military Impact on Campus Research" chaired by Professor Feshbach submitted a report saying that a "policy of openness" should govern research at MIT.Professor Feshbach strove to increase the number of women and minority faculty members at MIT. He chaired the faculty's Equal Opportunity Committee  which made recommendations in 1991 for recruiting more women faculty members."He was an extremely smart  very friendly man  but he also had a toughness about him. He helped many of us start our careers  and was always straightforward and very thoughtful " Professor Marc A. Kastner  chairman of the physics department  told the Boston Globe.As head of the physics department  "Herman was as dogged in his defense of fundamental physics as he was kind in his mentoring of younger colleagues " said Professor Jaffe. "The corridors of Building 6 resonated to his laughter and his animated defense of principles of physics or politics for nearly 60 years."The Department of Physics inaugurated the annual Herman Feshbach Lectures in 1984  honoring him for his distinguished career and service to the department. The Herman Feshbach Professorship was inaugurated in 1999 to support theoretical physicists.Professor Feshbach was a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1969 and headed the physics section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1987. He was president of the American Physical Society (APS) from 1980-81 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1982-86. Professor Feshbach served on several government and professional committees and was a consultant to the Brookhaven  Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories as well as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. He was also the longtime editor of the journal Annals of Physics.Professor Feshbach leaves his wife  Sylvia (Harris); a daughter  Carolyn of Lexington; two sons  Theodore of Hopedale and Mark of Minneapolis; a sister  Florence Nadelman of Cranford  NJ; two brothers  Bernard of Palo Alto  CA and Sidney of Amherst; and two grandchildren.A funeral was held on December 27 in Stanetsky Memorial Chapels in Brookline. A memorial service will be held at MIT at a time to be announced.
Ilona Karmel Zucker  75  novelist  MIT teacher,Retired MIT writing instructor Ilona Karmel Zucker  75  a Holocaust survivor who used that experience as a basis for much of her writing  died at Mt. Auburn Hospital in Cambridge on November 30.Ms. Karmel  who taught in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies from 1978-95  had a profound influence on many of her students. For example  she urged Cheston D. Buchanan (SB 1994 in civil engineering) to apply for a List Foundation Fellowship to complete a novel  which was published in May 1994.

Alumnus  wife die in last week's Singapore Airline crash in Taipei,Dr. Kah Kay Sung  who earned five MIT degrees from 1986-95  was killed in the Singapore Airlines crash in Taiwan last Tuesday.Dr. Sung  35  and his wife  Jennifer Loo of Hong Kong  were among 81 persons on flight SQ006 who died when it crashed while attempting to take off at Chiang Kai-shek Airport in Taipei. The Boeing 747 carried 159 passengers and 20 crew members. Dr. Sung and Ms. Loo were en route to Los Angeles to attend the Association for Computing Machinery Multimedia Conference.Dr. Sung's body has been found and identified. Ms. Loo is presumed dead but has not been identified yet. Ms. Loo  28  an economist  is a graduate of Wellesley College.An assistant professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS)  Dr. Sung won the School of Computing Teaching Excellence Award for the second time shortly before he died. He had been on the NUS faculty since 1995  when he received the PhD in electrical engineering from MIT. Before that  Dr. Sung  a founder and president of the MIT Singapore Students Society (SSS)  received two SBs from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1986  an SM and EE in 1992 and a PhD in 1996.Dr. Sung's PhD thesis and subsequent work on face detection has had "a significant impact" on research in the field  said Dr. Tomaso Poggio  the Uncas and Helen Whitaker Professor in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Dr. Sung and a colleague hold a US patent on a technique for image screening and feature detection."He was a great human being and a dear friend " said Professor Poggio  who was Dr. Sung's thesis advisor. "I will miss him greatly  as will all of us at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning and the AI Lab who knew him."Dr. Sung's MIT peers remember a quiet man with a wry sense of humor who reached out to teach Cambodian refugee children sponsored by his church in Woburn. A man of simple tastes  he indulged himself by driving a black Acura.While a graduate student  he maintained an active interest in the SSS and continued to participate in fundraisers for undergraduate social events. He was once named the SSS Nerd of the Year.He was a dedicated fan of Star Trek and professional wrestling  often trying to convince friends to attend the matches with him or to watch them on television. He was nicknamed Mr. Perfect after one of the WWF wrestlers. A dedicated jogger  he also ran in the 1994 Boston Marathon.The Singapore Students Society invites condolence messages and recollections to be posted on its web page athttp://web.mit.edu/mitsss/www.In one of the first messages posted  Dr. Wey Fun (PhD 1995) wrote: "Among the Singaporean academics  his research interest and percepts are perhaps the closest to mine. I will have one friend less who can profusely discuss AI topics with me. It's hard to cope with the loss."Hui-Lin Lai (SB 1992) said: "I deeply moan for Kah Kay and Jennifer's death. However  there is a little silver lining here: at least they go to heaven together ever after. This tragedy teaches me a lesson: treasure every single moment with my loved ones while alive. Life is too short to wait." Said Tzu-Jun Yen: "He was a really nice guy and a good president -- very organized."Dr. Sung is survived by his father  Dr. Sung Wing Huen  a surgeon; his mother  Dr. Sung-Yap Siew Khim  a general practitioner; and a sister  Dr. Sung Min  all of Singapore.WILLIAM WESTPHALWilliam Westphal  a retired research affiliate in the Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems  died October 3 at age 84.

Memorial service scheduled at chapel for Charles Miller,A memorial service for Charles L. Miller  the former head of theDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineeringwho died last February  will be held on Wednesday  Nov. 15 at 1:30pm in the MIT Chapel. Immediately following the service there will be an informal reception in the Spofford Room (1-236).Professor Miller died in his Tampa  FL home on February 29 at age 70 following a long illness.In 1969 Professor Miller was named head of the Department of Civil Engineering at MIT. At age 32  he was the youngest faculty member ever to head the department  and he played an important role in revising the department's curriculum. He helped usher civil engineering into the computer age by developing methods of using computers to analyze data for locating highways  and in 1961 developed COGO  the first computer program for topographical surveying and an early forerunner of CAD programs. COGO was later incorporated into Professor Miller's Integrated Civil Engineering System (ICES)  which placed computing power into the hands of designers in many engineering fields.In 1960 he founded MIT's Civil Engineering Systems Laboratory  the first in the country. From 1968-77 he was founder and director of the Urban Systems Laboratory at MIT  an interdepartmental lab for research into engineering  planning and management. In 1970 he was named associate dean of engineering and interim director of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory  a post he held for one year during the lab's transition from MIT's Instrumentation Lab into an independent research lab. He left MIT in 1977 to run his own company  CLM/Systems  Inc. in Tampa.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon November 1  2000.
Professor Hurley of geology is dead at 88,Dr. Patrick M. Hurley  professor emeritus of geology and geochemistry and recipient of the Walter H. Bucher Award for his life's work from theAmerican Geophysical Union  died on October 21 in Mt. Dora  FL. He was 88.Professor Hurley's field was applying natural radioactivity to determine the age of rocks in the Earth's crust  leading to an understanding of the assemblage of the basement rocks in the various continents. From this base  he worked on the growth of the continental masses  continental drift and early studies in plate tectonics.His Laboratory for Geochronology at MIT was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission for many years  and subsequently by Office of Naval Research and theNational Science Foundation. Most of the lab's work investigated the growth of radiogenic isotopes in mineral systems containing radioactive parents  principally the pairs rubidium-strontium  uranium-lead and potassium-argon. Measurements required solid-source mass spectrometry for the most part  utilizing laboratory-designed mass spectrometers prior to the availability of commercial instruments. In addition  the overall growth of radiogenic strontium-87 in crustal materials was used as a measure of the time-scale and extent of the geochemical differentiation of the Earth's crust from the deep interior.Rock samples to be dated were collected from key assemblages in many parts of the free world  and included samples returned from the moon.Dr. Hurley was the author of two books: How Old is the Earth? (Doubleday)  translated into 11 languages  and Living with Nuclear Radiation (University of Michigan Press). He was also the editor of a McGraw-Hill series of paperbacks  and on the editorial board ofPrecambrian Research Earth and Planetary Science Letters  andGeochemica Acta. He served as president of theGeochemical Societyand chairman of the Tectonophysics Section of theAmerican Geophysical Union. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  theAmerican Geophysical Union  theGeological Societyof America and theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science  and an Honorary Fellow of theGeological Society(London).At MIT  Professor Hurley taught subjects in geochemistry  geochemical thermodynamics  mineral deposits and geochronology. He served as faculty chair and president of the Faculty Club  and also chaired the Committees on Educational Policy and the First Two Years  as well as several of the standing committees. He chaired the search committee for a new president  leading to the installation of President Wiesner and Chancellor Paul Gray. Professor Hurley retired from the faculty in 1977.Patrick Mason Hurley was born in Hong Kong in 1912 and moved to Victoria  British Columbia in 1921. He received the BA and BAS degrees in mining engineering from Victoria College and the University of British Columbia in 1934. He received a Royal Society of Canada Fellowship to attend graduate school at MIT and completed his doctorate in 1940. He was a research associate at MIT and the University of Wisconsin briefly before joining the Institute faculty in 1946. He became an associate professor in 1951 and a full professor in 1953  serving as executive officer in the department from 1950-61.Dr. Hurley married Margaret Macurda in 1941  and they had three children: David  Peter (SB 1968) and Pamela (SB 1977). Since his retirement  the Hurleys have lived on Marco Island  FL; New London  NH; and Mt. Dora  FL. He is also survived by a sister  Isobel Reuter of Cleveland.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon November 1  2000.
John Corley  director of Concert Band for 51 years  dies of cancer at 81,John D. Corley  director of MIT'sConcert  Bandfor 51 seasons  died of cancer on October 19 at age 81.Mr. Corley directed the Concert Band from its inception in 1948 until his retirement last spring. During that time  he oversaw the commission of about 50 new works  developed a repertoire of more than 350 pieces and worked with more than 1 000 MIT students.Mr. Corley received a standing ovation when he was introduced in the audience at theSchool of Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences50th anniversary concert last month. The concert featured a performance of Time Into Gold by Adrian Childs (SB 1994)  commissioned by the MIT Concert Band for its 50th Anniversary Concert in May 1999 and Mr. Corley's simultaneous retirement."John Corley is part of the history of music at MIT " said Professor Peter Child of music and theater arts last year on the occasion of Mr. Corley's retirement. "In true MIT spirit  he always emphasized innovative and newly composed work alongside the tried and true. He gave student composers opportunities to hear and conduct their work with the band. John is loved and respected by his colleagues and students for his personal charm and exceptional moral decency."AN INSPIRATION TO STUDENTSMr. Corley's dedication to his students -- and their devotion to him -- was apparent at his retirement concert last year  which was attended by more than 70 former students from across the country. In a tribute to Mr. Corley at that event  President Charles M. Vest referred to the generations of MIT students he had taught and mentored and "who have drawn inspiration from his guidance and enthusiasm. For half a century no one has been more devoted to the cause of music at MIT  or more beloved for his musical achievements  than John Corley."In a tribute to Mr. Corley at his funeral service on Monday  one of his former students  Charlie Marge (SB 1984)  described how Mr. Corley challenged him and other students in ways that enabled them to grow as musicians and people. "Rather than selecting music that everyone could play perfectly  he found works that pushed the limits of our abilities " said Mr. Marge. "Instead of sticking with familiar tonalities  he opened up to us a world of modern music that we didn't even know was there  and encouraged us and our audiences to be open-minded about it " he said."By challenging us to only play music originally written for concert band and by commissioning new works for band  he taught us a fundamental respect for composers  and enabled us...to make a meaningful contribution that reached far beyond the MIT campus. By encouraging student leadership he gave us opportunities to grow as future leaders in life " said Mr. Marge.At various stages in his career  Mr. Corley directed the MIT Symphony Orchestra (1955-65)  founded and directed theBoston Brass Ensemble  taught conducting at the Boston Conservatory of Music  directed the Boston Conservatory's Wind Ensemble and served as music director of the Brookline Public Schools. He was a member of theNew England Conservatory of Music's Board of Trustees and a member of the board of advisers atBerklee College of Music.Mr. Corley received bachelor's and master's degrees in music from Boston University and began his career in Iceland as the youngest band leader in the United States Army  where he conducted more than 700 concerts for Allied troops. In 1993 the MIT Concert Band went on tour to Iceland  a surprise the students had arranged for him. In 1999  just prior to his retirement  Mr. Corley was presented with the Gordon Y Billard Award  presented annually to a member of the MIT faculty  non-faculty employee or one not necessarily affiliated with the Institute  for exemplary service.The Concert Band  now under the direction of Thomas Reynolds  will perform the commissioned piece  "Corley's March" in Mr. Corley's honor at its fall concert this Sunday  Oct. 29 at 8pm in Kresge Auditorium.Mr. Corley is survived by three sons  John D. III of Quincy  Gene of Watertown  and Bruce of Newton; three daughters  Sally of Roslindale  and Johanna and Erica  both of Newton; a brother  Robert of Zephyr Hills  FL; and four grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon October 25  2000.
Mathematician Professor Dirk Struik dies at 106,Professor Emeritus Dirk J. Struik  a highly respected analyst and geometer and an internationally acclaimed historian of mathematics  died at his home in Belmont on Saturday. He celebrated his 106th birthday on September 30.Professor Struik was a member of the MIT mathematics faculty from 1928 until 1960  and remained intellectually active throughout his life.Beginning in 1912  Professor Struik was educated very broadly in mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden  taking courses from Lorentz and de Sitter. After a short interruption (for lack of funds)  he was invited by J. A. Schouten to do research on tensor analysis and differential geometry. It was during this time that he met and soon married Saly Ruth Ramler  a Czech mathematician and accomplished modern dancer. Dr. Ramler wrote her doctorate on the axiomatics of affine geometry under G. Pick and G. Kowalewski at the University of Prague in 1918  and as Professor Struik later wrote  "Ruth may well have been the first woman at the more than 500-year-old university to receive a doctorate in mathematics."With a stipend from a Rockefeller Fellowship  the Struiks moved to Rome and then to Gï¿½ï¿½ttingen  which was becoming a major mathematical center. There they met and worked with Cartan  Courant  Hilbert  Landau and Noether  among others. Professor Struik also collaborated with MIT Professor Norbert Wiener  who in the spring of 1926 offered him a lectureship beginning that fall.Professor Struik's long and successful career in differential geometry led to a great many mathematical papers and books  including the 1950 text Lectures in Classical Differential Geometry. He had been interested since spending time in Rome in the history of mathematics. In 1948 he published A Concise History of Mathematics  Volumes I & II and Yankee Science in the Making. One reviewer of the first book said that "the author takes care to distinguish between established facts  plausible theories  wild hypotheses and traditional ideas."In a centennial tribute to Professor Struik in 1994 by theDibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology  Executive Director Evelyn Simha said: "As an historian of mathematics  he is particularly important to us here at this center for advanced research in the history of science and technology  because of his great and influential book  A Concise History of Mathematics  beautifully balanced between technicalities and generalities  translated into uncountable languages  most recently Persian. With this book and his historical scholarship  Struik has become the instructor responsible for half the world's basic knowledge of the history of mathematics."Professor Struik held an abiding interest in Marxism. Following World War II and into the McCarthy period  his political views attracted attention  and in September 1951 he was indicted by a Middlesex County Grand Jury on charges of advocating the overthrow of the United States and Massachusetts governments. At the time of the indictment  MIT suspended Professor Struik from teaching duties with full pay and benefits until the case could be dealt with in the courts. After five years  the charges were dropped without trial  due to lack of evidence and a US Supreme Court ruling that states do not have jurisdiction in such matters.In May 1956  MIT President James R. Killian Jr. reinstated Professor Struik. The following October  acting on the recommendations of a faculty review committee  the MIT Corporation's executive committee upheld the restoration of Dr. Struik's tenure but censured him "for conduct unbecoming" an MIT professor  based largely on his use of the Fifth Amendment before the House Un-American Activities Committee and "his comparative lack of candor with members of the administration."On this subject  Dibner Institute Executive Director Evelyn Simha noted in her 1994 tribute: "From the very beginning  personally and professionally  and continuing even now  Professor Struik's great concern for people in oppressed situations has been the backdrop for all his activities  has informed his life and work in fact  even when it brought him hard times." Later  she added: "He wanted to link mathematics with the socio-economic background against which mathematics developed  questioning the weight of social and economic forces in the development even of the 'pure math' of the Greeks  for example. He is now interested in ethno-mathematics and remains unshaken in his social and political beliefs."Professor Struik continued his scholarly and teaching work after his retirement in 1960. In 1975 he was awarded a Gold Medal of Achievement by the National University of Mexico "for his services to the teaching and development of mathematics in Mexico over the years." In March and April that year  Professor Struik gave a series of lectures on the History of Mathematics to the MIT Concourse Forum.

Retired MIT math professor dies at 106; was acclaimed historian of mathematics,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Professor Emeritus Dirk J. Struik  a highly respected analyst and geometer and an internationally acclaimed historian of mathematics  died at his home in Belmont  MA  on Saturday. He celebrated his 106th birthday on September 30.Professor Struik was a member of the MIT mathematics faculty from 1928 until 1960  and remained intellectually active throughout his life.Beginning in 1912  Professor Struik was educated very broadly in mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden  taking courses from Lorentz and de Sitter. After a short interruption (for lack of funds)  he was invited by J. A. Schouten to do research on tensor analysis and differential geometry. It was during this time that he met and soon married Saly Ruth Ramler  a Czech mathematician and accomplished modern dancer. Dr. Ramler wrote her doctorate on the axiomatics of affine geometry under G. Pick and G. Kowalewski at the University of Prague in 1918  and as Professor Struik later wrote  "Ruth may well have been the first woman at the more than 500-year-old university to receive a doctorate in mathematics."With a stipend from a Rockefeller Fellowship  the Struiks moved to Rome and then to Gï¿½ï¿½ttingen  which was becoming a major mathematical center. There they met and worked with Cartan  Courant  Hilbert  Landau  and Noether  among others. Professor Struik also collaborated with MIT Professor Norbert Wiener  who in the spring of 1926 offered him a lectureship beginning that fall.Professor Struik's long and successful career in differential geometry led to a great many mathematical papers and books  including the 1950 text Lectures in Classical Differential Geometry. He had been interested since his time in Rome in the history of mathematics. In 1948 he published A Concise History of Mathematics  Volumes I & II  and Yankee Science in the Making. A reviewer of the first book said that "the author takes care to distinguish between established facts  plausible theories  wild hypotheses and traditional ideas."In a centennial tribute to Professor Struik in 1994 by the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology  Executive Director Evelyn Simha said: "As an historian of mathematics  he is particularly important to us here at this center for advanced research in the history of science and technology  because of his great and influential book  A Concise History of Mathematics  beautifully balanced between technicalities and generalities  translated into uncountable languages  most recently Persian.

Retired MIT professor and active alumnus John Hrones dies at 87,CAMBRIDGE  MA -- John A. Hrones of Sarasota  FL  and Jaffrey  NH  a former professor and proud alumnus of MIT  died Wednesday of brain cancer at the Briarwood Health Center in Needham. He was 87 years old.When he entered MIT as a freshman  he was told: "MIT is a place for men to work and not for boys to play." That no-nonsense introduction blossomed into a lifelong love affair between the man and his alma mater.Professor Hrones  whose parents were Czech immigrants  graduated from MIT in 1934 and taught in the Department of Mechanical Engineering for 19 years. His ties to MIT remained strong even after he left his alma mater in 1957 to become vice president of academic affairs at Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland  now Case Western Reserve University.A longtime resident of Wellesley  MA  he was awarded the Bronze Beaver award in 1992 "in grateful recognition of distinguished service to the MIT Association of Alumni and Alumnae." It is the highest honor the Association can bestow upon a member.Professor Hrones was a member of the MIT Alumni Club of Southwest Florida for more than 20 years and served as its president from 1985-91 and 1993-99. He also was President of the Class of 1934 from 1989-99 and a member of the Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1993-95.Born on Sept. 28  1912 and brought up in Boston  Professor Hrones attended Mechanic Arts High School  later known as Boston Tech  before he matriculated at MIT in 1930  the same year Karl Taylor Compton became the Institute's ninth president. He occasionally quipped that they were "freshmen at the same time." An avid skater  Professor Hrones played three years of varsity hockey  serving as the team's captain as a junior. He was also a member of the Engineering Society and ROTC.Upon graduation  Professor Hrones served as an instructor in mechanical engineering for two years while he worked toward his master's degree. He was assistant manager of a lawnmower factory from 1937-39 before returning to MIT to pursue a doctorate. He was appointed assistant professor in 1941 and received the PhD the following year.During World War II  Dr. Hrones worked on the automatic positioning of gun mounts at the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory. In 1944  he joined the Draper Instrumentation Laboratory to work on the A-1 bombsight for the Army Air Corps. He helped create the DEW line to detect enemy planes flying toward the US over Canada and played a role in designing an automatic control device for a new aircraft engine for Chrysler Corp. He also taught Dynamics to the Navy V-12 Group.After the war  he helped develop the first power brakes for Chrysler in the 1950s.Dr. Hrones was appointed an associate professor in 1945 and full professor in 1948. He also headed the Machine Design Division and was director of the Dynamic Analysis and Control Laboratory.He became provost at Case Institute in 1964 and continued to serve in that capacity at Case-Western Reserve University from 1967-76. He was a trustee of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the Cleveland Skating Club. He also was a founder and life trustee of the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok.Professor Hrones was a member of the American Society for Engineering Education  the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  the National Academy of Engineers  the Academy of Arts and Science  Tau Beta Pi  Sigma Xi and Pi Tau Sigma. He wrote numerous articles and technical papers for scientific journals.Upon retirement  Professor Hrones divided his time between New Hampshire and Florida.Professor Hrones is survived by two daughters  Janet Roach of Waldron Island  WA  and Mary Parsons of Ann Arbor  MI; two sons  Stephen of Concord and John Anthony Jr. of Needham; seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His wife of 53 years  the former Margaret Baylis  died in 1991.A memorial service will be held on Aug. 12 at 2pm at the First Church in Jaffrey Center  NH.

Toyoichi Tanaka  physicist who discovered "smart" gels  dies at 54,Physics Professor Toyoichi Tanaka  recognized worldwide for his revolutionary discovery of "smart" gels  the phase transition in polymer gels  died of heart failure on May 20 while playing tennis. He was 54. The wake was held on May 24."Professor Tanaka's pathbreaking work on gels exemplifies the spirit of innovation and the interaction between fundamental scientific curiosity and practical applications that is so important at MIT. He will be deeply missed by colleagues here and around the world " said President Charles M. Vest."Toyo was a great physicist and a superb teacher " said Professor Marc Kastner  head of the Department of Physics. "His demonstrations of the miraculous properties of gels were spellbinding and showed young and old that even commonplace materials can behave in wondrous ways. He was a personal friend and I will miss him greatly."Professor Tanaka was the inaugural holder of the Otto and Jane Morningstar Professorship of Science in the physics department and a principal investigator at theCenter for Materials Science and Engineering. His pioneering researchon "smart" gels led to applications ranging from cleaning up pollutants and releasing pharmaceuticals in the body to finding the origins of life on earth.SMART GELS"Smart" gels are a class of materials that expand or contract when triggered by tiny changes in temperature  light  a solvent or other stimulus. The ability of the gels to undergo huge but reversible changes in volume allows unique new systems to be made that can encapsulate and release materials. Gels can be engineered to clean up pollutants or oil spills. Even in cosmetics  gels could hold and then release key ingredients like fragrance in response to factors like skin pH. Gels can be used as soft valves or act as artificial muscles."That's the beauty of it " Professor Tanaka once said. "Depending on what a gel interacts with  it will have different behaviors."A gel is a polymer -- a long chain of monomers  or molecules  that are cross-linked like a web of fibers. It is those links  which allow a gel to capture water within them  that give gels their elasticity and fluidity. The fundamental principles that govern the swelling equilibrium and dynamics also turned out to be a powerful paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of polymer behaviors in general. Professor Tanaka was exploring the idea that gels may provide a clue to the baffling puzzle of how life on Earth began."By understanding the phase transitions of gels  we can better understand protein functions  the molecular basis of life " he said. Life boils down to amino acids. Made up of different sequences of 20 amino acids  proteins twist into shapes that they "remember;" they recognize certain molecules and can store and release them as necessary; they help life-sustaining chemical reactions take place. They line up in chains called polymers. Scientists can determine the sequence of amino acids that make up specific proteins  but they don't know how to make one from scratch.Professor Tanaka's laboratory is working on synthesizing a gel with characteristics similar to those of proteins capable of recognizing a target molecule. What's more  this can be done without specifying the gene sequences to "build" the protein artificially."This may be a crude model of 'prebiotic polymerization ' which is a key step in the origin of life and prebiotic evolution " he said. "Some sort of prearrangement of the individual amino acid or nucleotide molecules that join together in a certain shape and sequence to make the polymer  possibly in the presence of some target molecule  can be easily imagined to exist in the primordial soup."The current theory holds that back in the Earth's early days  amino acids swimming around in a primordial soup randomly came together in a viable sequence. This theory didn't hold much water with Professor Tanaka. For one thing  he said  there hasn't been enough time since the beginning of the universe to try all the possible combinations. With 20 existing amino acids and 400 possible working sequences  that is a mind-boggling number."There is no way that amino acids happened upon the one particular sequence for a protein such as hemoglobin by accident " he said.Professor Tanaka was born in Nagaoka-city  Niigata Prefecture  Japan in 1946. He received his BS in (1968)  MS (1970) and DSc (1973) in physics from the University of Tokyo. He joined the MIT physics faculty in 1975 after working for the department as a sponsored research staff member. He married Tomoko Tahira in 1970.In 1992  Professor Tanaka co-founded GelMed Inc.  a Bedford company. GelMed and its sister company  Gel Sciences Inc.  explore medical  cosmetic  commercial and industrial applications for gels. More recently  he co-founded Buyo-Buyo  Inc. to bring to fruition medical solutions for enhancing and extending human lives.AWARDS AND HONORSProfessor Tanaka was the winner of the 38th Toray Science and Technology Prize from the Toray Science Foundation in Japan and the 1994 Inoue Prize for Science  awarded for outstanding achievements in basic sciences in general and given each year to a scientist under age 50.

MIT Professor Jonathan Allen dies; developed talking computer in '70s,CAMBRIDGE  Mass. -- Professor Jonathan Allen of West Newton  Mass.  director of MIT'sResearch Laboratory of Electronics(RLE) since 1981  died Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston of complications from a lengthy illness. He was 65 years old.Professor Allen guided the laboratory through numerous changes and in many new research directions. His own research centered on speech processing  computational linguistics  computer architecture and integrated electronics. He received worldwide notice for developing a computer named Morris that could talk and read in the 1970s -- an era when such a machine was relegated to the musings of science fiction writers. A system developed by Professor Allen has been used by physicist Stephen Hawking. In recent years  Professor Allen had been working with newly developed interactive software which emphasizes the exploration process and promotes a deeper understanding of circuits.Professor Allen developed an international network through research relationships  seminars and classes he taught in numerous foreign countries  including Germany  Japan  India  France  Italy  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. He had planned to spend this semester at Cambridge University as a Visiting Fellow at Trinity College  refining his work on computers as interactive learning devices.In a letter to the RLE community  Daniel Kleppner  acting director of RLE and the Lester Wolfe Professor of Physics  said  "Jon was totally dedicated to RLE. Over the years  the entire RLE community has benefited immeasurably from his wisdom and energy. There is no way for me to describe how much he will be missed."Professor Allen joined the MIT faculty in 1968 as an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He was promoted to associate professor in 1972 and full professor in 1975. He joined RLE as associate director in 1978.In the mid 1970s Professor Allen moved away from digital signal processing and speech production  and started investigating computer-aided design techniques for the emerging field of very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit design. He started teaching "Introduction to VLSI" at MIT in 1979 as a regular term course. Interest in the course was so high that Professor Allen taught it during the summers and at IBM's Yorktown research center. One of his first students in that class  Steve McCormick  became his first PhD student in the area of computer-aided design (CAD). Mr. McCormick  co-founder of Sapphire Design Automation  is a widely recognized expert in techniques for interconnect analysis. Professor Allen had five PhD students whose careers span the breadth of the CAD field.A native of Hanover  NH  Professor Allen received the AB from Dartmouth College in 1956 and the MS from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering the next year. He earned the PhD from MIT in 1968. Professor Allen was a member of Phi Beta Kappa  Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi. He was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)  a member of the Acoustical Society of America  and a past president of the Association for Computational Linguistics.He worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories on the technical staff from 1962-66 before becoming the supervisor of human factors engineering in 1966. His research at Bell Labs involved the design of semiautomatic telephone information bureaus and vocoder systems.Professor Allen is survived by his wife  Ann (Chase) of West Newton; two sons  Douglas of Auburndale and Jay of Newton Centre; and a sister  Sylvia Nelson of Hanover  NH. A memorial service is being planned. A fund will be established at MIT in his memory.

Former Professor Charles Miller of civil engineering dead at 70,Charles L. Miller  a former MIT faculty member credited with introducing computers and systems approaches into the teaching and practice of civil engineering  died in his home in Tampa  FL on February 29 after a long illness. He was 70.Professor Miller  who at age 32 in 1961 was the youngest professor to be named head of the Department of Civil Engineering  played an important role in revising the department's curriculum  incorporating studies of thermodynamics  electrical engineering  and statistical theory and mathematical models.He helped usher civil engineering into the computer age by developing methods of using computers to analyze data for locating highways  and in 1961 he developed the first computer program for topographical surveying  an early forerunner of CAD programs. The program  called COGO -- short for Coordinate Geometry System -- understood traditional civil engineering terms such as "locate " "inverse " "ramp" and "alignment " making the early computers more accessible to civil engineers for surveying problems.COGO was later incorporated into Professor Miller's Integrated Civil Engineering System (ICES)  which placed computing power into the hands of designers in many engineering fields  including transportation  urban development  housing and construction engineering.Professor Miller continued to enhance that program  later creating a version (Civil Engineering Automated Library  or CEAL) that ran on personal computers.In 1968  President Nixon appointed Professor Miller to head the Transportation Task Force  charged with preparing a report on all phases of US transportation and recommending legislation to address problems.Professor Miller was born in Tampa on June 5  1929. He earned the SB (1951) and SM (1958) from MIT in civil engineering. In 1960 he founded MIT's Computer Engineering Systems Laboratory  the first in the country. From 1968-77 he was director of the Urban Systems Laboratory  an interdepartmental lab for research into city planning and management.In 1970 he was named associate dean of engineering and interim director of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory  a post he held for one year during the lab's transition from MIT's Instrumentation Lab into an independent research lab. He left MIT in 1977 to run his own company  CLM/Systems  Inc. in Tampa.In 1998  the American Society of Civil Engineers honored Professor Miller with the Computing in Civil Engineering Award for "his pioneering achievements in computing  his development of the concepts and computer programs for coordinate geometry and digital terrain modeling  and his contributions to civil engineering computer computational achievement."Among his other awards were the Outstanding Young Men of Greater Boston Award (1965). He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Latin America Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences.Professor Miller is survived by his wife  Roberta (Pye) of Tampa; and three sons  Hank and Jonathan of Springfield  NY  and Stephen of Apollo Beach  FL.A memorial service was held in Tampa on March 3.

Sloan Adjunct Professor Richard Beckhard dies at age 81,Richard Beckhard  a founder of the field of organizational development  pioneering consultant on issues of managing change  and adjunct professor at the Sloan School from 1963-1984  died in New York City on December 28  1999. He was 81.For nearly 50 years  Professor Beckhard helped organizations function in a more humane and high-performing manner  and to empower people to be agents of change. He began his career in the theater  first as an actor and then as a Broadway stage manager. During World War II  he directed the entertainment of troops in the Pacific.In 1950  his expertise in theatrical staging brought him to the attention of founders of the National Training Laboratories (NTL)  who asked him to improve the staging of NTL training sessions. When Mr. Beckhard himself participated in T-Groups at NTL  the experience stimulated his seminal thinking on the relationships between group functioning and problems faced by managers in corporations.In the late 1950s  he began collaborating with the late MIT Professor Douglas McGregor  who created the Organization Studies Department at the School School. With Dewey Balch  they initiated a project designed to facilitate the change process in organizations  naming it organization development. Mr. Beckhard's emphasis on system-wide change in organizations distinguished him as a pioneer in this emerging field. Also in the 1950s  Mr. Beckhard began working with executives at several multinational companies.In the late 1960s  with colleagues Warren Bennis and Edgar Schein (now a Sloan professor emeritus)  he launched the Addison-Wesley Organization Development Series. Mr. Beckhard wrote eight books and numerous articles  including Organization Development: Strategies and Models; Changing the Essence; and Richard Beckhard: Agent of Change: My Life  My Practice.In 1967  under the auspices of the NTL  he launched the Organization Development Network  the first training program for specialists in organization development. The Family Firm Institute  an organization devoted to developing family-owned business that he founded in the 1970s with his second wife  Elaine Kepner  has supported training programs at more than 150 US and European universities.Mr. Beckhard is survived by his third wife  Sandra Barty  and a sister  Barbara MacNeill.A memorial service will be held Sunday  Feb. 13 at 3pm at Trinity Church on Broadway and Wall Street in New York City.

Graduate student dies in holiday mountain-climbing accident,Irina Libova -- Irka to her friends -- left her mark on the Gertler biology laboratory.The second-year PhD student impressed her peers and teachers with her inventiveness  inquisitiveness and her ability to do outstanding research. She also decorated her work area and the margins of her research notes with sardonic observations in addition to smiling or frowning faces. The dispenser on her workbench in Rm 68-258 bears the following message: "Thou shalt not steal my tape."Ms. Libova  a 23-year-old graduate of Washington University in St. Louis  will not return to the lab to complete her research in cell migration. She and her fiancï¿½  Vladimir Smirnov  29  and a companion  42-year-old Ilia Krasic  were killed in a mountain-climbing accident in Mexico last month."She joined the lab last spring and she quickly demonstrated that she was one of our brightest students " said Assistant Professor Frank Gertler. "It's a big loss. I'll miss her personally and professionally. I'm disappointed that I won't get to see her develop into the fine scientist she would have become. She would have made a big contribution to the lab." He said Ms. Libova would be listed as an author on any paper written about the project she was working on.Ms. Libova's group  which set out on Christmas Day to climb Mexico's highest peak  18 700-foot Mt. Orizaba  was last seen on December 28. The next day  a search party of 25-30 volunteers started combing the area with no success. After some urging over the holiday weekend  helicopters joined the search."I was very gratified that several members of the MIT community and colleagues in Washington responded immediately to e-mail requesting assistance from the US and Mexican governments with the search " President Charles M. Vest said.The climbers were discovered and removed by helicopters on January 2 on a ravine northeast of the peak.Ms. Libova  who emigrated to the US from Russia with her family  was a popular member of the Russian Hussar Club  "a satirical  literary group of people " said Areg Danagoulian  who received the SB in physics last June. Mr. Danagoulian wished Ms. Libova luck on the eve of the expedition to Mexico and joked about the dire possibilities  a tradition among Russian climbers. "The next thing I hear are the grim details about their death " he said.Dmitry Kulish  a postdoctoral fellow in chemistry at the Harvard Medical School  met Ms. Libova and Mr. Smirnov through mountain-climbing. As experienced climbers  he said  "the probability of their death on the Orizaba was equal to the probability of our death on the ski slope  a 10 billion-to-one chance. It is unfair  unbelievable and tragic. I cannot think about it. I miss them very much."Ms. Libova's apartment on Binney Street in Cambridge was a gathering place for Russian ï¿½migrï¿½s  among them Sophia Menn  a Brandeis University biologist who is doing clinical research at Beth Israel Medical Center. The women met two years ago when Irka arrived in Boston and a close friendship developed."She loved to live  learn  read  hike  climb and discover " said Ms. Menn. "She was in a hurry to experience everything there is to experience  to feel everything there is to feel. Often she told me  'What is there to wait for? Got to live  feel and breathe today.' I learned a lot from her. I loved her  and I miss her a lot."Ms. Libova is survived by her parents  Lucy and Alexander  and a sister  Olga  all of Mountain View  CA. A memorial service will be scheduled at MIT.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 12  2000.

Lloyd Rodwin dies at 80,Lloyd Rodwin  80  the Ford International Professor Emeritus of Urban Studies and co-founder of the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies  died December 7 at Massachusetts General Hospital of congestive heart failure.Professor Rodwin began his career when the field was dominated by architects and emerged as one of the leaders of the urban planning profession  as it developed an intellectual base in the social sciences and humanities. He was renowned for his analyses of urban and regional problems in developing countries  which influenced development projects in Europe  Africa  the Middle East and Latin America.Professor Bernard Frieden  a former student of Professor Rod-win's and one of his successors as director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies  said  "Lloyd really changed the field from city planning to urban studies. He emphasized research on how cities work  and he worked with people outside of planning like [Sen. Daniel Patrick] Moynihan  James Q. Wilson  Oscar Handlin  Alan Altshuler and Martin Meyerson. Lloyd made the field much broader and extended it to the Third World."Rodwin "was hugely influential " Sen. Moynihan told the New York Times. "He redefined the study of cities  defined them in terms of the people who lived there rather than the buildings in which they lived. He was a great teacher of professors. He broke the iron hold of urban studies " as it had been defined  in terms of "laying out a grand city  or a grand suburb."Born in September 14  1919 in Brooklyn  NY  the son of an immigrant baker from Poland  Rodwin dedicated himself to improving life for the underprivileged. He attended City College of New York (CCNY)  where he studied with and was deeply influenced by philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen. At CCNY  he was also inspired by the writings of philosopher George Santayana and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.He wanted to be a high school teacher  but he failed the civil service exam by following the style of his favorite author  Laurence Stern  using dashes rather than periods. He was therefore disqualified  even though he otherwise received the highest possible grade. Not sure what to do  he signed up for a $10 course on housing with Charles Abrams  a noted urbanist and New York Commissioner on Housing  at the New School for Social Research. He became Abrams's research assistant.Later he worked in the US Defense Housing Program in Washington  DC. There he met his future wife  Nadine Posniak  who introduced him to a world of European culture and ideas.Professor Rodwin's work in Washington was interrupted when he was drafted. After an early discharge due to poor eyesight  he joined his future wife at the University of Wisconsin and earned the MA in land economics. Soon thereafter he became a Littauer Fellow at Harvard University  where he completed the PhD there in regional planning  in 1949.Professor Rodwin led an interdisciplinary team from the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies (which he co-founded with Martin Meyerson in 1959) in organizing one of the most extensive efforts to design a new city -- Ciudad Guayana -- in southeastern Venezuela. The combined efforts of economists  anthropologists  sociologists and other social scientists  as well as land-use planners  became a model for a new kind of integrated planning. He wrote a book on the project  Planning Urban Growth and Regional Development (MIT Press  1969).Professor Rodwin founded and directed from 1967-89 the Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies (SPURS)  a program that has brought more than 400 mid-career professionals to MIT from developing nations on four continents. He took the lead  along with Senior Lecturer Emeritus Melvin King  in establishing the MIT Community Fellows Program for black and other minority community leaders to study at MIT.Professor Rodwin's view that social science should complement physical planning helped to change planning education in the United States. While he was chair ofDUSPfrom 1969-73  he oversaw a tripling of the faculty. He transformed the department by introducing new social science faculty and course work  as well as a focus on international comparative studies  housing policy  environmental policy and economic development. The program served as a model for others around the world.His experience as an advisor to the United Nations and other international organizations  as well as to the governments of several developing nations  led Professor Rodwin to write Nations and Cities  a comparative study of the role of government in devising and implementing urban and regional growth strategies.Professor Rodwin was the author or editor of 11 books  including a forthcoming edited volume (with Bishwapriya Sanyal  head ofDUSP)  The Profession of City Planning: Changes  Images and Challenges  1950-2000. He trained generations of planners around the world; his former students have assumed significant leadership and teaching positions throughout the world and extended and deepened his influence.In addition to his wife  Nadine Posniak Rodwin of Cambridge  Professor Rodwin is survived by two sons  Professor Victor George Rodwin of New York University and Professor Marc Andre Rodwin of Indiana University; a daughter  Julie Anne Rodwin  a consultant in Groton  MA; a brother  Ted Rosenbaum; a sister Claire Levy of Laguna Hills  CA; and six grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon December 15  1999.
Architect Marjorie Pierce  oldest alumna  dies at age 99,Marjorie Pierce  99  of Weston  who had been MIT's oldest living alumna  died December 7 at the age of 99.Ms. Pierce graduated from MIT in 1922 with an SB in architecture and received a master's degree in architecture from MIT the following year. Her classmate Martha Munzer predeceased her in September.Ms. Pierce practiced architecture for more than 70 years. She was president of the MIT Women's Association from 1940-44 and was instrumental in raising the endowment for the Ellen Swallow Richards Professorship  named in honor of MIT's first woman student and faculty member.She participated in a variety of volunteer roles for the Association of MIT Alumni and Alumnae  including serving as treasurer and then vice president of the Class of 1922  a member of the Alumni Fund Board and the National Selection Committee  and as a committee member and board leader of the Association of MIT Alumnae (AMITA).Ms. Pierce visited MIT for her class reunion in 1997 and again in 1998  when she enjoyed the exhibit "125 years of Women at MIT" in which she was featured.The oral history of her life was recorded by an MIT student as part of the AMITA/MacVicar Oral History Project. In the oral history  she talked about the home-made fudge she sold to put herself through school and the architectural prize she believed she was denied because she was a woman. When clients balked at hiring a woman architect  she would list the limitations of male architects. "They don't know how a house works. They don't know how a kitchen works. Why should they design it?" she recalled telling wary clients. "Here's a stove that men designed  and you have to reach across over the burners to reach the shutoffs."Ms. Pierce  who left no immediate survivors  was buried December 13 in Lynwood Cemetery in Weston. A memorial service will be announced at a future date. Contributions in her memory may be made to MIT for the Independent Residence Development Fund  MIT Rm 10-110  77 Massachusetts Ave.  Cambridge  MA 02139.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon December 15  1999.

Robert Swanson  52  alumnus who launched biotechnology industry,Robert A. Swanson (SB 1969  SM)  a pioneer in the commercialization of recombinant DNA technology who was recognized as one of the 1 000 most important figures of the millennium  died on December 6 at the age of 52 at his home in Hillsborough  CA after a year-long battle with brain cancer. He was a former member of the MIT Corporation and held two MIT degrees  the SB in chemistry and the SM in management.At the age of 29  Mr. Swanson foundedGenentechin 1976 with scientist Herbert Boyer and transformed the biotechnology revolution into an industry.Genentechcloned human insulin  human growth hormone  alpha interferon to treat a form of leukemia  and gamma interferon used to treat a rare immune-deficiency disease. The company produced a hepatitis B vaccine  a clotting agent for hemophiliacs and an activator to dissolve blood clots in heart attacks.Under Mr. Swanson's management Genentechformed research agreements with other companies and in 1979 became the first major biotech company to show a profit. It went public in 1980. Ten years later Genentechand Roche Holding Ltd. of Switzerland completed a $2.1 billion merger.Mr. Swanson served as CEO ofGenentechfrom its founding in 1976 through 1990  and from 1990-96 was chairman of the board of directors.In the book  1 000 Years  1 000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who Shaped the Millennium  authors Agnes Hooper Gottlieb  Henry Gottlieb  Barbara Bowers and Brent Bowers ranked Mr. Swanson number 612  calling him the "entrepreneur who launched the biotechnology revolution."President Charles Vest commented  "MIT is very proud to have Bob Swanson as an alumnus. He represents our finest institutional aspirations.... He is the quintessential American entrepreneur  having founded not just a company  but an industry -- one that creates wealth  jobs  and  above all else  improves health and quality of life. Gentle and warm  yet brimming with enthusiasm and ideas  Bob has been unfailingly kind and helpful to me. He shared challenging thoughts about motivating scientists to do their finest work  and about the relationship between universities and industry. He was  for a period  a valued trustee of MIT  and continued to serve on visiting committees  traveling across the country to advise us."Last summer I was privileged to spend several hours with Bob. He gave me a tie  saying that I needed a better way to display MIT's mascot -- the beaver. Indeed  this handsome piece of fabric was covered with beavers beneath shining moons. On close inspection  the beavers are clearly chewing down the Stanford pine tree. I wear it with pride. Yet I think most of Bob's humanity. He always shared news of his family  and especially of his daughters' triumphs on the soccer field. We frequently talked about the wonderfully talented students that MIT is fortunate to attract. He would always say  with typical humility  "What's going to happen to the average kids like me?" In reality  Bob has never been even close to average; he is a giant who made biotechnology an industry -- an entirely new way to use science to advance human health."Institute Professor Philip Sharp  former head of biology  said  "Bob Swanson saw in this new technology an avenue to improve the lives of individuals and to create an industry which would translate modern biological science into jobs and future growth of the technology...Genentechretains many of the values of Bob Swanson such as a commitment to excellent science and its active publication. Bob also was very concerned about the people who worked forGenentechand created an environment where they could flourish. Bob Swanson was a friend of many faculty at MIT and of the Institute. He generously served as a member of the Department of Biology's Visiting Committee where his advice was very helpful."After retiring fromGenentech  Mr. Swanson formed K&E Management  a private investment management firm. He was chairman of the board of Tularik  Inc.  a biotechnology firm focused on therapeutics which act through the regulation of gene expression. He contributed to numerous civic and cultural activities and served as a trustee of the San Francisco Ballet  the Museum of Contemporary Art  the San Jose Tech Center  and as chairman of the board of Nueva School. He is well remembered as Coach Bob of his daughters' winning soccer teams.He is survived by his wife  Judy Church Swanson  and their daughters Katie  16  and Erica  11. His mother Arline Swanson of Foster City  CA also survives him.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon December 8  1999.
Lloyd Rodwin  80  MIT urban studies professor  extended the field of planning to social sciences and the Third World,BOSTON  Dec. 8--Lloyd Rodwin  80  Ford International Professor Emeritus of Urban Studies at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and co-founder of the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies  died Tuesday  December 7  at the Massachusetts General Hospital of congestive heart failure.Rodwin was a path-breaker in his field. A former president of the International Regional Science Association  and winner of the Distinguished Planning Educator Award from the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning  he began his career when the field was dominated by architects and emerged as one of the leaders of the urban planning profession  as it developed an intellectual base in the social sciences and humanities. Rodwin was renowned for his analyses of urban and regional problems in developing countries  which influenced development projects in Europe  Africa  the Middle East and Latin America.MIT Professor Bernard Frieden  a student of Rodwin's and now associate dean of the School of Architecture and Planning  said  "Lloyd really changed the field from city planning to urban studies. He emphasized research on how cities work and worked with people outside of planning like Pat Moynihan (Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan)  James Q. Wilson  Oscar Handlin  Alan Altshuler and Martin Meyerson. Lloyd made the field much broader  and extended it to the Third World."Born in September 14  1919 in Brownsville  Brooklyn  the son of an immigrant baker from Poland  Rodwin dedicated himself to improving life for the underprivileged. He attended City College (CCNY)  in Manhattan  where he studied with and was deeply influenced by philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen. At CCNY  he was also inspired by the writings of philosopher  George Santayana  and Supreme Court Justice  Oliver Wendell Holmes.He wanted to be a high school teacher  but he failed the civil service exam by following the style of his favorite author  Laurence Stern  using dashes rather than periods. He was therefore disqualified  even though he otherwise received the highest possible grade. Not sure what to do  he signed up for a ten dollar course on housing  with Charles Abrams  a noted urbanist and New York Commissioner on Housing  at the New School for Social Research. He became Abrams' research assistant.Later he worked in the U.S. Defense Housing Program in Washington  D.C. There he met his future wife  Nadine Posniak  a recent Jewish refugee from France who escaped in June of 1940 by way of Portugal and whose parents were  themselves  Russian ï¿½migrï¿½s from the 1917 revolution. She introduced him to a world of European culture and ideas. She accepted his marriage proposal  but only on a five year trial basis. They renewed the five year contract 10 times after the first trial proved successful.His work in Washington D.C. was interrupted when he was drafted to the U.S. Armed Forces. He completed basic training (as well as training in finance) when he was told he would be discharged because of poor eye-sight. Rather than stay until the next morning and receive his winter military coat  he took the first bus to Madison  Wisconsin to be with his future wife who was then a graduate student in labor economics at the University of Wisconsin. There Rodwin earned his M.A. in land economics. Soon thereafter he became a Littauer fellow at Harvard University and completed his Ph.D. there in regional planning  in 1949.Rodwin's first book  British New Towns Policy (1956)  criticized the utopian traditions of Ebenezer Howard's "Garden Cities" and his American followers  Lewis Mumford and Catherine Bauer Wurster. However  this did not preclude him from organizing one of the most extensive efforts to design a new city -- Ciudad Guayana -- at the confluence of the Orinoco and Careen Rivers in southeastern Venezuela. Rodwin led an interdisciplinary team from the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies  which he co-founded with Martin Meyerson in 1959. The combined efforts of economists  anthropologists  sociologists  and other social scientists  as well as land-use planners  became a model for a new kind of integrated planning. Following his book on this project  Planning Urban Growth and Regional Development (MIT Press  1969)  his colleagues published seven others that analyzed the Ciudad Guayana Project from diverse disciplinary perspectives.The Joint Center was a main source of scholarly literature on urban studies in the 1960s and 1970s  publishing books from the MIT and Harvard University Presses. Rodwin served as chairman of the Joint Center's policy committee from 1959 to 1969. He also founded  and directed from 1967-1989  the Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies (SPURS)  a program that has brought over 400 mid-career professionals to MIT from developing nations on four continents. He took the lead  along with Melvin King  in establishing the MIT Community Fellows Program for black and other minority community leaders to study at MIT. This program aimed to provide grassroots community leaders with the opportunity to learn new skills at DUSP and the rest of MIT.Rodwin's view that social science should complement physical planning helped to change planning education in the United States. While he was chair of the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) from 1969-1973  Rodwin oversaw a tripling of the faculty. He transformed the DUSP by introducing new social science faculty and course work (including history  economics  sociology  anthropology) as well as a focus on international comparative studies  housing policy  environmental policy and economic development. The MIT Program served as a model for other programs in the United States and around the world.His experience as an adviser to the United Nations and other international organizations  as well as to the governments of Venezuela  Turkey and other developing nations  led Rodwin to write Nations and Cities -- a comparative study of the role of government in devising and implementing urban and regional growth strategies.Rodwin was the author or editor of 11 books  including a forthcoming edited volume (with Bishwapriya Sanyal)  The Profession of City Planning: Changes  Images and Challenges  1950-2000. His research and scholarship have contributed to many aspects of the planning field: studies on the future of the metropolis; essays on images and themes of the city in the social sciences (Cities of the Mind  Plenum  1984  with Robert Hollister); research on the relation between national policies and urban growth  shelter and development  industrial change and regional economic transformation; and analyses on the experience of development -- Rethinking the Development Experience: Essays Provoked by the Work of Albert Hirschman (edited with Don Schon  Brookings  1994).As a teacher  Rodwin trained generations of planners around the world. He was known for his use of socratic questioning  a technique he drew from his studies in philosophy and applied to the study of complex and controversial issues in planning. In the classroom  Rodwin would typically get students to state their position and ask a few disarmingly simple questions which usually resulted in students changing their views. When asked what they learned years later  students often said  "He taught us how to think!" His former students have assumed significant leadership and teaching positions throughout the world and extended and deepened his influence.In addition to his wife  Nadine Posniak Rodwin of Cambridge  Mass.  Professor Rodwin is survived by his two sons  Professor Victor George Rodwin of New York University  and Professor Marc Andre Rodwin of Indiana University in Bloomington  Indiana; his daughter  Julie Anne Rodwin  a consultant in Groton  Massachusetts; his brother Ted Rosenbaum and sister Claire Levy of Laguna Hills  California  and six grandchildren.

Physicist George Valley Jr. is dead at 86,Professor Emeritus of Physics George Edward Valley Jr.  86  an air defense specialist and founder of the Experimental Study Group  died October 16 in Boston of complications following heart surgery.Professor Valley was born September 5  1913 in New York City and received the SB from MIT (1935) and the PhD from the University of Rochester (1939) in nuclear physics. He made the first measurements of iron isotopic abundance in terrestrial and meteoritic materials from 1939-41 as a research associate and National Research Council Fellow at Harvard University.At MIT's Radiation Laboratory (1940-46)  he developed the H2X radar bombsight that played a strategic role in World War II  permitting all-weather bombing of Nazi Germany. This required trips from Boston to London by bomber during the Blitz (passengers were required to ride in the empty bomb bay during takeoff) and return by seaplane via Brazil. After the war  he was on the editorial board of the Radiation Lab Technical Series and edited four books  including the popular Vacuum Tube Amplifiers .In 1946  Dr. Valley became a professor of physics at MIT  where he conducted research in cosmic ray physics that included operation of a high-pressure cloud chamber at 12 000 feet on Mt. Evans  CO. His interests continued in air defense as a member of the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (1946-64). He conceived a national air defense system of radar stations guarding the northern air approaches to the United States and linked by telephone lines to a centralized digital computer (SAGE). This work led directly to the founding of Lincoln Laboratory  where he was assistant and associate director (1949-57)  and to many advances in computer technology  including the invention of magnetic core memory and telephone transmission of digital data.Professor Valley was chief scientist of the Air Force from 1957-58 and returned to MIT in 1959. He received the US Army Certificate of Appreciation  the President's Certificate of Merit  the Air Force Association of Science Award and the USAF Exceptional Civilian Service Medal. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.In 1969  Professor Valley founded the Experimental Study Group  which emphasized a revolutionary learning process for first year students. "I was interested in fostering students who would be courageous enough to think in new ways without fear of getting the wrong answer. In short  I was going to educate potential Nobel laureates " he later recalled.Professor Valley married Louisa King Williams in 1941 and Shea Alice LaBontï¿½ in 1960. He is survived by his wife; three children from his first marriage  George C. Valley of Los Angeles  John W. Valley of Madison  WI  and Katharine V. Nakamoto of Winchester  MA; and four grandchildren. In lieu of flowers  gifts may be sent to the George E. Valley Jr. Scholarship Fund  American Physical Society  College Park  MD.

Martha Munzer  MIT's oldest alumna  dies at 99,Martha Eiseman Munzer  the first woman to earn an MIT degree in electrochemical engineering  died on September 14 in a Florida nursing home  hours before its patients were evacuated to escape Hurricane Floyd. Ms. Munzer  who was MIT's oldest living alumna  would have been 100 on September 22.A member of the Class of 1922  Ms. Munzer taught chemistry at the Fieldston School in Riverdale  NY for more than 30 years. In the 1930s  she and two associates campaigned to save natural habitat in Riverdale from development for educational use. In the 1960s  this same trio was offered the Wave Hill Estate by Mayor John Lindsay  and Mrs. Munzer served as the first educational director of Wave Hill. When she moved to Florida  she joined the Friends of the Everglades.Ms. Munzer  whose favorite author was Henry James  published the first of her 11 books at age 52  most of them about ecological issues and planning. Through her writing  she was a pioneer in conservation education.At age 79  she published a memoir  Full Circle: Rounding Out a Life. Isaac Corkland  an acquaintance in their youths  recognized her style when an excerpt was used in a writing class. They were married when she was 80 and he was 84.Ms. Munzer received the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Award in a White House ceremony in 1993 and arrived at her 95th birthday party with galley proofs of a history of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea  FL. At 93  she told the Miami Herald  "Every day I swim in an unheated pool and read a book. I believe older people need to exercise their minds by learning something new  and I try to do that daily."Known as Mardie  or Marty  Ms. Munzer was educated in Ethical Culture schools and was a lifetime secular humanist. She published two articles in dialog with her grandchild  who became a fundamentalist Christian.Ms. Munzer  who suffered a stroke recently  had lived in the Broward Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Fort Lauderdale for two years.Her great-niece  Nina Zanger of Jamaica Plain  wrote about Aunt Marty in an essay that won first prize among fifth grade students in a town-wide contest in Brookline three years ago. Clearly  Ms. Munzer was a hero and a role model for her grandniece."My aunt inspires me to fulfill my dreams and to treat life well because you only have one chance to live it " Ms. Zanger said. "Whatever your dreams are  they can always be completed if you really want them. Your past can lead to a great future. Also no matter what your gender  you can complete any dream of yours if you have the will to do it."For example  Marty decided to go to MIT in 1918. The dean told her  'Young lady  this is no place for you.' Marty replied  'Well  if I pass the exams  will you take me?' The dean replied they'll have to. She studied  passed the exams and was accepted." When she applied to MIT  she used her first-name initial on the application  not revealing her gender.Ms. Zanger said her Aunt Marty had passed on a formula for a happy  healthy life: exercise  eat well  get your rest  work hard  have lots of good friends and have fun. Ms. Zanger wrote: "According to Marty  the key words to life are these: endure the hard times  love  learn  marvel at the wonder of being alive in this awesome and wonderful universe. The last key word to life is laugh  not only over the tragic comedy in which we find ourselves the actors  but more especially for the very joy of being momentarily on the stage."At the time  Ms. Munzer was swimming  hiking and exercising daily and leading an active social life. "I hope that when I turn 97 I'll be just like her and hopefully as athletic as she is!" Ms. Zanger wrote.Ms. Munzer's first husband  Edward Munzer  and Mr. Corkland predeceased her. She is survived by twin daughters  Stella Loeb of Cold Spring  NY  and Martha Amato of Salem  OR; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Donations in her memory may be made to the Scholarship Fund of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. A memorial service is planned for 2pm on October 30 at the home of her nephew  John Vogel of Scarsdale  NY.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon September 29  1999.

Rota mourned by students and colleagues,A memorial for Professor Gian-Carlo Rota  an internationally respected mathematician and philosopher and a dedicated and beloved teacher  will be held on Friday  April 30 at 5pm in Rm 34-101. Professor Rota died of heart failure in his home last week at the age of 66.Dr. Rota apparently died in his sleep. He was found in bed on the afternoon of April 19 after failing to arrive in Philadelphia the day before for a series of three lectures he was to give at Temple University. The cause of death was atherosclotic cardiovascular disease  according to the Middlesex County Medical Examiner.Dr. Rota was the only MIT faculty member ever to hold the title of Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy.As a mathematician  he is credited with having transformed his specialty area  combinatorics -- which he described as "putting different-colored marbles in different-colored boxes  seeing how many ways you can divide them" -- from an insignificant field to one of the most important areas of mathematics today."Gian-Carlo Rota almost single-handedly lifted the subject of combinatorics from a barely respectable obscurity to one of the most active areas of mathematics today " said Richard Stanley  a mathematics professor at MIT who is also a former student of Dr. Rota's. Dr. Stanley was one of the organizers of Rotafest  a four-day mathematical conference held at MIT in 1996 honoring Dr. Rota's 64th birthday."Through his commitment to the highest standards of scholarship and his generous sharing of ideas and time  he has inspired innumerable students and colleagues to share his enthusiasm and joy for combinatorics and related areas of mathematics " Professor Stanley said.As a philosopher working in the 20th-century continental tradition of phenomenology -- a philosophical tradition established by Edmund Husserl -- Dr. Rota was known for his humanistic approach."He always brought a very fresh perspective on philosophical issues because he dealt with them with a mathematician's style and interest " said Robert Sokolowski  a priest and philosophy professor at the Catholic University of America. "He had a good sense of human realities. He felt that the continental approach -- as opposed to the analytical -- brought out more effectively the humane side of scientific and philosophical questions. He was very imaginative. He saw the big context of all those things. That's why he's so irreplaceable."As an author  Dr. Rota was known for his elegant but forthright style and subtle wit. In his forward to Dr. Rota's most recent book  Indiscrete Thoughts (Birkhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½user  1997)  Dr. Sokolowski said  "His writings have much of Socrates's irony and wit  and the occasional barb is also socratic  meant to illuminate and to sting the reader into looking at things afresh. In these essays  mathematics is restored to its context in being and in human life."Some of the essays in Indiscrete Thoughts debunk the "myth of monolithic personality" through sketches of the lives of notable mathematicians. Dr. Rota commented that when the book was first published  one mathematician wrote that he would not speak to him again. The book  which is divided into three parts -- two on mathematics and one on philosophy -- has been nominated for the 1999 Edwin Goodwin Ballard Book Prize in phenomenology presented by the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy.Professor Rota was co-author of an earlier book of essays on mathematics  science and philosophy called Discrete Thoughts (Birkhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½user  1986)  and at the time of his death  he was working on the third book of this trilogy  which he hoped to call Forbidden Thoughts. He had recently completed the first draft of an introduction to probability titled Geometric Probability (Birkhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½user).In the early 1960s  Dr. Rota founded a mathematics journal called Advances in Mathematics  which is described by mathematician and editor Peter Renz as "the most prestigious  most elegant  interesting and unusual of the mathematics journals. And it's entirely Gian-Carlo's creation. He wrote the acid-tongue book reviews that could be devastating.""He was my first graduate student at Yale " said Jacob T. Schwartz  who was Dr. Rota's dissertation advisor and is now a professor at New York University. "He began as a functional analyst and after a few years moved on to combinatorics  where he became a leading national and international figure."He really loved mathematics all his life very passionately. He was also a person of great cultural and literary attainment. He loved to write  loved to edit. He was a gourmet of mathematics. He was ebullient  a bit of a raconteur " Professor Schwartz said.Dr. Rota was able to engage people in ways that made lasting impressions. He is known among students at MIT for his accessibility and his clear presentation of material in both math and philosophy courses. He was respected for his deep understanding of those subjects and revered for his love of communicating."The first course of his I took changed my life " said Eric Prebys  a senior majoring in mathematics and computer science. "He helped me to see the world in a totally different way. And that's what I wanted out of college. What always came through was his total faith in his students " said Mr. Prebys  who took two of Dr. Rota's phenomenology courses  as well as a math course in probability -- "the best probability course at MIT " he said.Dr. Rota inherited that probability course from the legendary mathematician Norbert Wiener. In July 1998 he was named the Norbert Wiener Professor of Mathematics. He won the James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award at MIT in 1996  which recognizes extraordinary professional accomplishments and service to MIT. He had been advisor to at least 44 graduate students and many undergraduates throughout his career.He joined the MIT faculty in the Department of Mathematics in 1959. The word "philosophy" was added to his title in 1972.He won the Steele Prize of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) in 1988 and the Medal for Distinguished Service from the National Security Agency in 1992. He held four honorary degrees from the University of Strasbourg  France (1984); the University L'Aquila  Italy (1990); the University of Bologna  Italy (1996); and Brooklyn Polytechnical University (1997).Dr. Rota was the invited presenter at the 1998 AMS Colloquium Lectures  a series of three lectures of increasing complexity presented each year by one of the world's most eminent mathematicians. He was to have presented three lectures -- the Groswald Memorial Lectures -- at Temple University this month. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1982  was vice president of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) from 1995-97 and was a member of numerous other mathematical and philosophical organizations.Dr. Rota was author or coauthor of seven books and founding editor or co-editor of three journals: Journal of Combinatorial Theory (1966)  Advances in Mathematics (1967) and Advances in Applied Mathematics (1979)  as well as founding editor of several book series  including Mathematicians of Our Time (MIT Press)  Contemporary Mathematician (Birkhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½user Boston) and Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Cambridge University Press)  and he served on the editorial boards of many other journals. He published close to 200 papers in mathematics or philosophy  and more than 500 short book reviews.He had been a consultant to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory since 1966  and for the Rand Corp. from 1966-71 and Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1969-1973. A book entitled Essays on the Future (scheduled for publication in October)  conceived and edited by Dr. Rota  is dedicated to Nick Metropolis  the sole survivor of the original Los Alamos group.Dr. Rota was born on April 27  1932 to a prominent family in Vigevano  Italy. Many of his family members had achieved prominence in their fields. His uncle by marriage  Flaiano  wrote scripts for Federico Fellini's films  including La Dolce Vita; his father  Giovanni  was a civil engineer and architect who specialized in anti-earthquake structures.Dr. Rota was educated in Italy until 1945  when his family was forced to leave Vigevano to escape Mussolini's death squads during World War II. Giovanni Rota was known to be antifascist and had been listed on the dictator's death list. He took his family to hide for a time in northern Italy before crossing the border into Switzerland and later moving to Ecuador  where Dr. Rota completed high school. The story of the family's escape has been told by his sister  Ester Rota Gasperoni  in two books  Orage sur le Lac (Rainstorm on the Lake) (L'Ecole des Loisirs  1995) and L'arbre des Capulies (The Cherry Tree) (L'Ecole des Loisirs  1996).Dr. Rota  who was fluent in English  Italian  Spanish and French and could read German and Latin  came to the United States in 1950. He received the BA summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1953  the MA from Yale University in 1954 and the PhD  also from Yale  in 1956  all in mathematics. He married Teresa Rondï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½n in 1956; they divorced in 1980.He is survived by his sister  Ester Rota Gasperoni; a nephew  Franco Gasperoni; and a niece  Laura Gasperoni Patanella  all of Paris; and an aunt  Rosetta Flaiano  of Switzerland.Burial of the ashes will be in Vigevano  Italy. In addition to Friday's public memorial service  a separate memorial service is also being planned by students of Dr. Rota. In lieu of flowers  donations may be sent to the MIT/Gian-Carlo Rota Memorial Fund. For more information  see the memorial web site set up by the Department of Mathematics.A version of this

Keilson  former adjunct professor at Sloan  dead at 74,Dr. Julian Keilson  74  former adjunct professor of management at the Sloan School of Management  died March 8 in his home near Rochester  NY. He taught at MIT from 1986-92.A specialist in applied probability  Dr. Keilson joined MIT's adjunct faculty after his retirement from the University of Rochester's William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration and of Statistics."Julian Keilson was a leading figure in the field of Operations Research " said Thomas L. Magnanti  dean of the School of Engineering and a founding co-director of the Leaders for Manufacturing Program. "He was one of a handful of individuals who led in defining the contemporary discipline of applied probability by creating  in the best spirit of MIT  sophisticated mathematics to address important applications."Julian  in particular  was an extraordinary model builder and analyst. Among his many talents  he was also a master chess player. My colleagues and I at MIT were privileged to know him as a faculty colleague and as a friend " Professor Magnanti said.Dr. Keilson held the BS in physics from Brooklyn College and MA and PhD from Harvard University. An author of more than 127 papers  he published two books  Green's Function Methods in Probability Theory and Markov Chain Models -- Rarity and Exponentiality. This spring  Kluwer Academic Publishers will release Advances in Applied Probability and Stochastic Processes (edited by J.G. Shanthikumar and Ushio Sumita)  which is dedicated to Dr. Keilson and his work in applied probability  stochastic processes and computational probability  among other fields.He lived in the Rochester suburb of Brighton  NY  and leaves his wife  Paula; a son  David of Cary  NC; a daughter  Julia Craig of Webster  NV; a brother  Sidney of Potomac  MD; a sister  Marcia Harrington of Reno  NV; and eight grandchildren.A version of this

MIT professor Gian-Carlo Rota  mathematician and philosopher  is dead at 66,Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gian-Carlo Rota  an internationally respected mathematician and philosopher and a dedicated and beloved teacher  died of heart failure in his home earlier this week. He was 66.Dr. Rota apparently died in his sleep. He was found in bed in his night clothes on the afternoon of Monday  April 19  after failing to arrive in Philadelphia Sunday afternoon for a series of three lectures he was to give this week at Temple University. The cause of death was atherosclotic cardiovascular disease  according to the Middlesex County Medical Examiner.Dr. Rota was the only MIT faculty member ever to hold the title of Professor of Applied Mathematics and Philosophy.As a mathematician  he is credited with having transformed his specialty area  combinatorics — which he described as "putting different colored marbles in different colored boxes  seeing how many ways you can divide them" — from an insignificant field to one of the most important areas of mathematics today."Gian-Carlo Rota almost single-handedly lifted the subject of combinatorics from a barely respectable obscurity to one of the most active areas of mathematics today " said Richard Stanley  a mathematics professor at MIT who is also a former student of Dr. Rota's. Stanley was one of the organizers of Rotafest  a four-day mathematical conference held at MIT in 1996 honoring Dr. Rota's 64th birthday."Through his commitment to the highest standards of scholarship and his generous sharing of ideas and time  he has inspired innumerable students and colleagues to share his enthusiasm and joy for combinatorics and related areas of mathematics " Stanley said.As a philosopher working in the 20th century continental tradition of phenomenology — a philosophical tradition established by Edmund Husserl — Dr. Rota was known for his humanistic approach."He always brought a very fresh perspective on philosophical issues because he dealt with them with a mathematician's style and interest " said Robert Sokolowski  a priest and philosophy professor at The Catholic University of America. "He had a good sense of human realities. He felt that the continental approach — as opposed to the analytical — brought out more effectively the humane side of scientific and philosophical questions. He was very imaginative. He saw the big context of all those things. That's why he's so irreplaceable."As an author  Dr. Rota was known for his elegant  but forthright style and subtle wit. In his forward to Dr. Rota's most recent book  Indiscrete Thoughts (Birkhäuser  1997)  Dr. Sokolowski said  "His writings have much of Socrates' irony and wit  and the occasional barb is also socratic  meant to illuminate and to sting the reader into looking at things afresh. In these essays  mathematics is restored to its context in being and in human life."Some of the essays in Indiscrete Thoughts debunk the "myth of monolithic personality" through sketches of the lives of notable mathematicians. Dr. Rota commented that when the book was first published one mathematician wrote that he would not speak to Dr. Rota again. The book  which is divided into three parts — two on mathematics and one on philosophy — has been nominated for the 1999 Edwin Goodwin Ballard Book Prize in phenomenology presented by the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy.He was co-author of an earlier book of essays on mathematics  science and philosophy called Discrete Thoughts (Birkhäuser  1986)  and at the time of his death  was working on the third book of this trilogy  which he hoped to call Forbidden Thoughts. He had recently completed the first draft of an introduction to probability titled Geometric Probability (Birkhäuser).In the early sixties  Dr. Rota founded a mathematics journal called Advances in Mathematics  which is described by mathematician and editor Peter Renz as "the most prestigious  most elegant  interesting and unusual of the mathematics journals. And it's entirely Gian-Carlo's creation. He wrote the acid-tongue book reviews that could be devastating.""He was my first graduate student at Yale " said Jacob T. Schwartz  who was Dr. Rota's dissertation advisor and is now a professor at New York University. "He began as a functional analyst and after a few years moved on to combinatorics where he became a leading national and international figure."He really loved mathematics all his life very passionately. He was also a person of great cultural and literary attainment. He loved to write  loved to edit. He was a gourmet of mathematics. He was ebullient  a bit of a raconteur."Dr. Rota was able to engage people in ways that made lasting impressions. He is known among students at MIT for his accessibility and his clear presentation of material in both math and philosophy courses. He was respected for his deep understanding of those subjects and revered for his love of communicating."The first course of his I took changed my life " said Eric Prebys  a senior majoring in mathematics and computer science. "He helped me to see the world in a totally different way. And that's what I wanted out of college. What always came through was his total faith in his students " said Mr. Prebys  who took two of Dr. Rota's phenomenology courses  as well as a math course in probability — "the best probability course at MIT " said Mr. Prebys.Dr. Rota inherited that probability course from the legendary mathematician Norbert Wiener. In July 1998 he was named the Norbert Wiener Professor of Mathematics. He won the James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award at MIT in 1996  which recognizes extraordinary professional accomplishments and service to MIT. He had been advisor to at least 44 graduate students and many undergraduates throughout his career. He joined the MIT faculty in 1959 in the mathematics department. The word philosophy was added to his title in 1972.He won the Steele Prize of the AMS in 1988 and the Medal for Distinguished Service from the National Security Agency in 1992. He held four honorary degrees from the University of Strasbourg  France (1984); the University L'Aquila  Italy (1990); the University of Bologna  Italy (1996); and Brooklyn Polytechnical University (1997).Dr. Rota was the invited presenter at the 1998 American Mathematical Society (AMS) Colloquium Lectures  a series of three lectures of increasing complexity presented each year by one of the world's most eminent mathematicians. He was to have presented three lectures — the Groswald Memorial Lectures — at Temple University in Philadelphia on Monday  Tuesday and Wednesday. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1982  was vice president of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) from 1995-97 and was a member of numerous other mathematical and philosophical organizations.He was author or coauthor of seven books and founding editor of three journals: Journal of Combinatorial Theory (1966)  Advances in Mathematics (1967) and Advances in Applied Mathematics (1979)  as well as founding editor of several book series  including Mathematicians of Our Time (MIT Press); Contemporary Mathematician (Birkhäuser Boston) and Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Cambridge University Press); and served on the editorial boards of many other journals. He had published close to 200 papers in mathematics or philosophy  and more than 500 short book reviews.He had been a consultant to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory since 1966  and for the Rand Corporation from 1966-71 and Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1969-1973. A book entitled Essays of the Future  edited by Dr. Rota  is dedicated to Nick Metropolis  the sole survivor of the original Los Alamos group. The book  scheduled for publication in October  was conceived entirely by Dr. Rota.Dr. Rota was born on April 27  1932 to a prominent family in Vigevano  Italy. Many of his family members had achieved prominence in their fields; his uncle by marriage  Flaiano  wrote scripts for Federico Fellini's films  including La Dolce Vita; his father  Giovanni Rota  was a civil engineer and architect who specialized in anti-earthquake structures.Dr. Rota was educated in Italy until 1945  when his family was forced to leave Vigevano to escape Mussolini's death squads during World War II. Giovanni Rota was known to be anti-fascist and had been listed on Mussolini's death list. He took his family to hide for a time in Northern Italy before crossing the border into Switzerland and later moving to Ecuador  where Dr. Rota completed high school. The story of the family's escape has been told by his sister  Ester Rota Gasperoni  in two books  Orage sur le Lac (Rainstorm on the Lake) (L'Ecole des Loisirs  1995) and L'arbre des Capulies (The Cherry Tree) (L'Ecole des Loisirs  1996).Dr. Rota  who was fluent in English  Italian  Spanish and French  and could read German and Latin  came to the United States in 1950. He received the BA summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1953  the MA from Yale University in 1954 and the PhD  also from Yale  in 1956  all in mathematics. He married Teresa Rondon in 1956; they divorced in 1980.He is survived by his sister  Ester Rota Gasperoni; a nephew  Franco Gasperoni; and a niece  Laura Gasperoni Patanella  all of Paris; and an aunt  Rosetta Flaiano  of Switzerland.Burial of the ashes will be in Vigevano  Italy. A public memorial service is being planned at MIT for Friday  April 30. A separate memorial service is also being planned by students of Dr. Rota.

Allis  98  helped bring RLE to prominence,William P. Allis  98  of Cambridge  professor emeritus of physics  died March 5 at Mt. Auburn Hospital in Cambridge after a brief illness. There will be a memorial service for him on Monday  March 22 at 3:30 in the MIT Chapel and a reception at 4:30 in the Compton Room (26-110).Professor Allis's theoretical research encompassed all aspects of gaseous electronics. He and Professor Sanborn C. Brown were instrumental in establishing MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics as one of the premier laboratories of its kind.Professor Allis was one of the co-founders of the American Physical Society's Gaseous Electronics Conference  and after serving as its chairman from 1949-62  he was named honorary chairman in 1966. He also served as assistant secretary general for scientific affairs with NATO from 1962-64.Since his retirement from MIT in 1967  he traveled extensively as a visiting professor and lecturer. He hosted many MIT faculty members and students at his 200-acre Yonder Farm in Dublin  NH  and continued to ski  climb nearby Mt. Monadnock  chop firewood and bicycle well into his later years.Professor Allis was born in Menton  France  in 1901  the son of Edward P. Allis Jr.  who graduated from MIT in 1870  and Amedine Sgrena. Home-educated  he came to MIT  graduated in 1923 after three years and earned a master of science degree in 1924. His postgraduate studies involved research at the University of Nancy in France  where he received the ScD degree in physics in 1925  Princeton University  the University of Munich and Cambridge University.His affiliation with MIT continued as a research associate (1925-29) and instructor (1931-34) in physics. He joined the department's faculty in 1934 and was appointed full professor in 1950.Briefly with MIT's Radiation Laboratory (RadLab)  Professor Allis conducted research on magnetron theory  and was then selected to serve as the liaison officer between the Pentagon and RadLab for the duration of World War II. He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and  in 1945  was awarded the Legion of Merit.His honors include fellowship in the American Physical Society and the Physical Society of London  the vice presidency of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences and the American Association of Physics Teachers. He also served as consultant to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory  as a member of various committees of the National Research Council and visiting professor at Harvard University.His books include Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (1952); Nuclear Fusion (1960); Waves in Anistropic Plasmas (1962  with Solomon Buchsbaum and Abraham Bers); Electrons  Ions and Waves (1967) and Principles of Laser Plasmas (1976)  as well as numerous articles in scientific journals.Professor Allis once said that the students he educated were his most significant achievement. "Whenever I am travelling in some distant  crowded airport  someone inevitably comes up to me and says  'Professor Allis  I worked with you!' That has been the most rewarding aspect of being a teacher."Professor Allis was predeceased by his wife  Nancy Olive (Morison) Allis  and a son  Edward Morison Allis. He is survived by a daughter  Amedine Allis Bella of Peterborough  NH; a son  John Cotton Allis of Belmont; grandsons William Phelps Allis II and Ivan N. Bella; and granddaughters Alyssa N. Bella  Padget G. Allis and Galen Allis. Memorial gifts may be given to the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Gaseous Electronic Conference of the American Physical Society.A version of this

Service on Thursday for Professor Landahl,A funeral service will be held in the MIT Chapel on Thursday  March 11 at 2:30pm for Mï¿½rten Landahl of Waltham  a professor of aeronautics and astronautics  who died suddenly on March 4. He was 71.Professor Landahl was internationally known for his work on unsteady flows  wave motion and hydrodynamic instability  and transition to turbulence  which arises when air or another moving fluid comes in contact with any kind of surface. Shortly before his death  he completed research on the basic initial theoretical problem of how a 3-D initial disturbance within a shear flow evolves over time. He felt certain his work would form a new fundamental approach to the transition problem (tackled by many in the past 100 years) as opposed to the classical Orr-Summerfield equation  and he had planned further research on completing the asymptotic long-time evolution of a 3-D disturbance in a parallel shear flow. He then planned to use this work as the basis for a new transition theory as well as a new turbulence model.Professor Landahl's early monograph  Unsteady Transonic Flow (Pergamon Press  1959) was awarded the status of a classic physics text when it was reprinted in paperback in 1995  and a text he co-authored with Holt Ashley  Aerodynamics of Wings and Bodies (Addison-Wesley  1965)  was one of the first to bring in the use of numerical techniques for wing loading predictions. His recent book  Turbulence and Random Processes in Fluid Mechanics (Cambridge University Press  1986 and 1992)  co-authored with E. Mollo-Christensen  was widely recognized as a clear introduction to this difficult subject.Born on August 6  1927 in Vasternora  Sweden  Professor Landahl attended the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and earned three degrees: the Civilingenjor in 1951  the Teknologie Licentiat in 1953 and a doctorate in 1959. He worked at MIT from 1954-56 as a research engineer in the Aeroelastic Laboratory and was then a research scientist for the Aeronautical Research Institute of Sweden from 1956-60 before returning to MIT as an associate professor. In 1963 he was promoted to full professor at MIT and in 1967 he was also named a full professor of mechanics at the Royal Institute of Technology.Professor Landahl  whose hobbies included studying many other fields of science as well as skiing and gliding  won a number of honors and awards. He was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences and the Royal Academy of Science in Sweden. In the United States  he was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.He received the Thulin Gold Medal from the Swedish Aeronautical Society in Stockholm for contributions in the field of aeronautics  was selected as the Ludwig Prandtl Memorial Lecturer (one of the highest honors in fluid mechanics) in Germany in 1983  and received the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Award from the International Council of Aeronautical Sciences in 1990. Professor Landahl also held patents for separation of heavy atoms from light atoms  and for separation of uranium hexafluoride.He is survived by his wife  Christine M.; two stepsons  Peder and Christian Soderstrom; a son  Gustaf; two daughters  Ingrid and Elisabeth Landahl; sisters Annalisa Landahl and Britta Schandler Landahl; a niece  Anna Karin Schandler; and seven grandchildren. He will be buried in Sweden.A version of this

Radar pioneer Rosebury dies at 97,Fred Rosebury  97  of Framingham  who came to MIT during World War II to do research at the Radiation Laboratory and headed the Vacuum Tube Laboratory for 20 years  died of complications resulting from a hip fracture on February 20. Mr. Rosebury  a longtime Natick resident  lived at The Heritage at Framingham  an assisted living facility.Mr. Rosebury  born in London on July 10  1901  emigrated to the United States with his family in 1910 and settled in New York City. After quitting high school  he traveled widely as a radio operator on tankers from 1920-27. He attended City College of New York  Columbia University and Cooper Union College  where he studied commercial art  a career he pursued from 1928-31. He worked briefly as a radio engineer and did research for the next 10 years at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York  where he started as a part-time volunteer.He joined the Radiation Laboratory in 1942 and invented several top-secret radar devices. While at the Vacuum Tube Lab at the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) from 1951-71  he published two manuals  several scientific papers and wrote the Handbook of Electron Tubes and Vacuum Techniques (Addison-Wesley  1965)  reprinted by the American Institute of Physics and Springer-Verlag in the 1980s. In addition  he served as a coach and role model for a number of PhD candidates.Mr. Rosebury retired from MIT in 1971 and did engineering consulting for a number of clients including NASA  for whom he designed a heated glove to be worn by astronauts.In addition to his engineering and scientific achievements  Mr. Rosebury was an accomplished artist who worked in many media including watercolor  pen and ink  scratchboard and gouache  and produced many serigraphs (silkscreen prints). His artwork was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in the early 1960s. He also made unusual jewelry  and in his 80s he produced a group of more than 35 constructions made from found objects.Mr. Rosebury  a member of the Society of Wireless Pioneers  kept his ham radio operator's registration current and used his "rig" until shortly before his death to stay in touch with a number of people  among them his ham radio buddy and shipmate from New Jersey  Wayne W. Clifford.Mr. Rosebury is survived by a daughter  Ruth R. Trussell of West Newbury  and a grandson  Jacob (Jake) H. Trussell of South Boston. His wife of 57 years  Pauline  died in 1993. Another son  Michael  died in 1996.Mr. Rosebury willed his body to the Harvard Medical School for research. A memorial service will be scheduled. For details  contact Ruth R.

Prof. Johnson of physics dies at 67,Kenneth A. Johnson  a physics professor at MIT for 40 years  died of cancer Tuesday at the MIT Infirmary. Professor Johnson  67  was a leader in the fields of quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory.Professor Johnson  born in Duluth  MN  on March 26  1931  earned the BS from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1952 and a master's degree and PhD from Harvard University in 1954 and 1955. He was a research fellow and lecturer at Harvard and a National Science Foundation Fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen  Denmark  before joining the MIT faculty in 1958 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1965.Professor Johnson's research deepened the understanding of quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics. In quantum field theory  he was the first to observe the dimensional and chiral anomalies. His work in quantum chromodynamics provided a method of describing the properties of a system of confined quarks  the MIT bag model. It was one of the first models to describe the properties of hadrons  including protons and neutrons."Ken was an outstanding member of the department in every way " said Profesor Marc Kastner  head of the Department of Physics. "He was a superb mentor for young faculty and students  an excellent classroom teacher and a wise counselor on departmental issues. We all miss him.""Ken was a widely admired and respected figure in his field " said Professor Francis Low  a colleague and friend for more than 40 years. "He was a marvelous man to have in your department. He sought scientific understanding at the deepest level  but he was alwaysready and able to support and assist his colleagues."Professor Johnson was a Fellow of the American Physical Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.He is survived by his wife  Gladys (Diaz de los Arcos) of Lincoln; and one son  Keith  a researcher at Alkermes Inc. who lives in Hudson  MA.

Henry Kendall  Nobel-winning physicist  dies at age 72,Professor Henry W. Kendall  a 1990 Nobel laureate in physics and longtime environmentalist  died on February 15 while exploring the wilderness he loved and worked to preserve. He was 72 years old.Professor Kendall  who shared the Nobel prize with his MIT colleague  Professor Jerome Friedman  and Professor Richard Taylor of Stanford University  was taking photographs on a scuba expedition with a friend from the National Geographic Society at the Wakulla Springs State Park in Florida when he died. Fellow divers found him unconscious in six to 10 feet of water at about 5pm. He was flown to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital  where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. Pending the final autopsy report  the Wakulla County Sheriff's Office said his death apparently resulted from abdominal hemorrhaging."Henry Kendall's death is a terrible loss to MIT  the scientific community and the world at large " said Professor Friedman. "Henry was an outstanding scientist and an outstanding human being who worked tirelessly for the betterment of society. He always saw the big picture and identified the big problems. He used political and scientific activity effectively to advance such goals as arms control  nuclear safety and a better environment."I worked with him for more than 40 years. He was a wonderful colleague and a wonderful friend. I will miss him terribly."President Charles M. Vest said:"Recently I was stranded by bad weather in an airport but had the good fortune to spend those two hours talking with Henry Kendall about a wide range of matters. As always  it was an education."Henry Kendall was visionary  passionate and effective in his appeals to humankind to care for our planet and for each other. His understanding of the world ranged from subatomic physics to the issues and technologies of war and peace. He was an ardent environmentalist and excellent photographer. His span of interests and actions contributed greatly to MIT and to the worlds of science  politics and social action."Dean of Science Robert J. Birgeneau said:"I  like many other people here at MIT  talked to Henry many times about a remarkable range of issues. He was a true independent spirit with a deep passion for a wide variety of social and scientific causes. Fortunately for us  Henry loved MIT  its faculty and its students  and of course he himself was a great scientist and a dedicated educator."Professor Marc Kastner  head of the Department of Physics  said:"I would like to emphasize that while Henry Kendall made great contributions to our understanding of physics and great contributions to a variety of humanitarian causes  he never stinted in his devotion to undergraduate education. We have always taken great pride in telling potential MIT undergraduates that our freshman laboratory was taught by Nobel Prize winner Henry Kendall. We will miss him as a colleague and a teacher."Professor Friedman came to to MIT in 1960 and Professor Kendall joined him a year later. They first worked together in the 1950s at Stanford. Their Nobel Prize-winning research provided the first experimental evidence for subnuclear particles called quarks  the most fundamental constituents yet known of heavy particles such as protons and neutrons. The work ultimately had a major impact in reconstructing some of the high-energy physics that attended the birth of the universe.Professors Friedman  Kendall and Taylor were the key members of the research team that found the first confirming experimental evidence for the quark model  which Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig of Caltech had proposed in 1964. Professor Gell-Mann won the 1969 Nobel prize in physics in part for his theory of quarks (a name that was taken from a character's phrase in James Joyce's novel  Finnegan's Wake).In the late 1960s  Professors Friedman  Kendall and Taylor executed a famous series of experiments on the scattering of electrons by protons  deuterons (a proton bound to a neutron) and heavier nuclei. Firing a beam of high-energy electrons at targets made of hydrogen or deuterium  the researchers were able to unravel mysteries in the data that characterized how the electrons were scattered.In 1968  these investigations gave the first clear evidence of a charged  point-like substructure -- quarks -- inside these massive particles. The revelation went completely against the conventional model of the interiors of protons and neutrons as "mushy" regions. It was believed that no point-like substructure would be found within the nucleons (protons and neutrons).Professor Kendall  who overcame a childhood reading disability  studied mathematics at Amherst College  graduating in 1950  and earned the PhD in physics at MIT in 1955. He taught at Stanford from 1956-61 before joining the MIT faculty in 1961. He became a full professor in 1967 and was named the J.A. Stratton Professor of Physics in 1991.In addition to his intellectual accomplishments  Professor Kendall was an expert mountain climber and scuba diver. An accomplished photographer  he chronicled his climbing and underwater adventures and enjoyed sharing the photographs with friends.Born in Boston on Dec. 9  1926  Professor Kendall grew up in Sharon  MA  and attended Deerfield Academy. He was in basic trainingat the US Merchant Marine Academy in 1945 when the first atomic bomb was dropped  and he served on a troop transport ship in the North Atlantic in 1945-46  at which time he transferred to Amherst.Professor Kendall  a founding member of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in 1969  served as its chair for the past 25 years.He was deeply involved with arms control and nuclear power safety issues. He played a leading role in organizing statements about global problems from the scientific community  including "The Call for Action" at the Kyoto Climate Summit in 1997 and the "WorldScientists' Warning to Humanity" in 1992. He was on a panel of scientists who briefed President Clinton on the dangers of global warming in 1997.For 10 years  Professor Kendall served as a consultant to the Department of Defense on classified matters as a member of the Jason Group and the Institute for Defense Analysis.He won a number of prizes in addition to the Nobel  including the Bertram Russell Society Award in 1982  the Environmental Leadership Award from Tufts University's Lincoln Filene Center in 1991  the Ettore Majorana-Erice Science for Peace Prize in 1994  the Award for Leadership in Environmental Stewardship from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future in 1997 and the Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service from the American Physical Society in 1998.He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Physical Society  the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences.Professor Kendall wrote numerous articles and co-authored five books  including Energy Strategies--Toward a Solar Future (1980)  Beyond the Freeze (1982)  Fallacy of Star Wars (1985) and Crisis Stability and Nuclear War (1988).Professor Kendall is survived by a brother  John  of Sharon. Funeral arrangements are pending. Letters of condolence may be sent to John Kendall  PO Box 521  Marion  MA 02738.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon February 24  1999.

Professor Emeritus Greeley  former director of admissions  dead at 88,Roland Bradford Greeley  professor emeritus of regional planning who served as director of admissions for 10 years during his 27-year career at the Institute  died on January 4 of heart failure. He was 88.Professor Greeley directed the Admissions Office from 1961-72  a period when the Institute first began the effort to diversify its student and faculty populations. While he was well known for his planning work  his MIT admissions work "was a really important part of his life. The license plate my mother gave him for his car said 'ADMIT '" said his daughter  Sally Anne Greeley Benson."During the period when Rolly was in charge  he brought us from a pre-World War II approach to admissions to the modern-day approach " said Peter Richardson  who served under Professor Greeley as associate director and subsequently became director following Professor Greeley's retirement.The transition was not an easy one for the Institute  which finally opened its first women's dormitory  McCormick Hall  in 1967. Lack of appropriate housing served as a limiting factor on the number of women admitted for many years.The 1960s shift in recruitment emphasis also required Institute faculty and administration to learn how and from where to recruit minority students.Professor Greeley "found himself at the center of heated discussion  with people pushing and pulling in every direction  and with a staff that was not quite certain what to do to help. It was hard work  and Rolly kept us all on an even keel " said Mr. Richardson.Before becoming director of admissions  Professor Greeley had already demonstrated his commitment to students through his participation on the Undergraduate Policy  Student Environment and Student Aid committees of the faculty. For two years he served as chair of the Freshman Advisory Council  a group of faculty members who were directly concerned with the counseling of first-year students."For him  admissions work was planning of a different sort--with people " his daughter said. "He was wonderful at interviewing people and making connections with them--wherever they were in the world. He always tried to make that personal connection."Professor Greeley was also widely known for his work in the planning profession. He served as a consultant to numerous cities and agencies in the United States and abroad  including Thailand and India  and was a member of the consulting firm Adams  Howard and Greeley.But the planning work that was perhaps closest to his heart was in his native Lexington  where he served on the Planning Board in the 1930s  and again in the sixties  holding the offices of secretary and chairman. He was also elected to the Board of Selectmen (1968-71) and held a seat on the Historic District Commission in the seventies. (Professor Greeley's father had played an active role in the Lexington community before him  serving as president of the Historical Society.) Among Professor Greeley's many contributions to his home town are the brown and white plaques he put up at historic sites on Massachusetts Avenue.The January 7 headline for his page one obituary in the Lexington Minuteman read: "Local icon Roland Greeley dead at 88."Professor Greeley received the AB from Harvard College in 1931 and attended the Harvard City Planning School from 1931-34. He was chief planner for the New England Regional Planning Commission from 1935-43 and a control engineer at the Federal Works Agency in Boston.He joined the MIT faculty as an assistant professor of regional planning in 1945  was promoted to associate professor in 1947  served as acting head of the Department of City and Regional Planning (now the Department of Urban Studies) from 1951-52  and was promoted to professor in 1961.He was a trustee of Mount Auburn Hospital and a member of the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations and the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Planners.Professor Greeley died in his twin sisters' home on Massachusetts Avenue in Lexington  the same house he lived in during his youth. "He spent his last week here  in the music room " said his sister  Anne Greeley Dutka. "His children and grandchildren were around the whole week. He was always very active in the First Parish Church and we had his bed where he could see it from the window. He could also see the Christmas tree  and we kept it lighted all the time for him."Mr. Greeley's wife  Marion (Kimball) died in 1986. Just last month he suffered the death of his son  Warren Kimball  who died at age 57.Professor Greeley is survived by three sons: William Bradford of Devon  PA  Edward Houghton of Nairobi  Kenya  and David McLean of Brooks  ME; a daughter  Sally Anne Greeley Benson of Bigelow  MN; twin sisters Ellen Greeley Bryant Warren and Anne Greeley Dutka  both of Lexington; 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.Funeral services were held on January 7 at the First Parish Church in Lexington.Donations in Roland Greeley's memory may be sent to the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church  7 Harrington Road  Lexington 02421-4897 or to the Star Island Corp.

Laya W. Wiesner is dead at age 79,Laya W. Wiesner  79  of Watertown  civic leader and champion of an expanded role for women at MIT and widow of MIT's thirteenth president  Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner  died Monday night (Sept. 28) in Mt. Auburn Hospital of complications from polymyositis  a degenerative muscular disease."Laya Wiesner was a remarkable woman with an indomitable spirit " said Catherine M. Stratton  widow of MIT's eleventh president  Julius. "She was incredibly courageous  allocating her energy to the causes which mattered most to her -- civil rights  mentoring MIT women students in the fields of science and engineering  and being a sparkling  creative partner to her husband."Dr. Wiesner  who died in 1994  was president of MIT from 1971 to 1980.Mrs. Wiesner was a founder and strong supporter of the Metropolitan Council on Education (METCO) program that brought minority children in Boston to suburban schools. She was a leader of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters  which she joined in 1952  and served as state chair for its Human Resources Committee from 1964-66. She helped organize the pioneering KLH Day Care Center in Cambridge  served on the Governor's Advisory Committee on Child Development in Massachusetts  and on the board of the Cambridge School of Weston.MIT President Charles M. Vest  noting that the Wiesners were a model leadership team  said  "I admired her for her leadership in the Boston area  and for her dedication to making MIT a broadly creative and caring institution."Rebecca M. Vest  the present First Lady of MIT  said she felt honored to present the Laya W. Wiesner award annually to the undergraduate woman who has done the most to enhance MIT community life "Laya never lost her abiding interest and love of the students here " said Mrs. Vest. "She was a gentle  intelligent caring woman who will be greatly missed by the MIT community." Mrs. Wiesner had personally selected all 18 winners of the award  established in 1980 by the MIT Women's League.During the Wiesner presidency  she took an active  and often leadership  role in various MIT projects and activities  including the MIT Women's League  the advisory committee on women and work  and the advisory board of MIT's Child Development Center. In 1973  she helped organize the workshop on Women in Science and Technology  which brought together leaders from government  industry and education to address the challenges and opportunities in this area.She also met regularly with women on the faculty  acting as their "eyes and ears" while working to increase their numbers  recalled Priscilla K. Gray  whose husband  Paul  succeeded Dr. Wiesner as president of MIT. "She was aware of the issues and keen to get them on the table " said Mrs. Gray  who remembered her as "very kind and generous of spirit  a great lady. She was always concerned about people; she always asked about their families. She was a very caring person and she always knew what was going on here."Dr. Paul Gray also remembered Mrs. Wiesner for her bravery and commitment to principles  even while battling a debilitating disease  recalling how "she carried on with fortitude  good cheer and courage.""Laya Wiesner was a great first lady for MIT " said Elizabeth W. Johnson  whose husband  Howard  preceded Dr. Wiesner. "She had compassion  wide-ranging interests and a special concern for women at the Institute as well as in society. Her quiet courage and bravery in her last difficult years were admired by everyone who knew her."Mrs.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wiesner met her husband-to-be at the University of Michigan when she was an undergraduate. She married him in 1940 after she received the BS in mathematics and he completed most of his doctoral work in communications engineering.They came to MIT in 1942 when Dr. Wiesner joined the Radiation Laboratory  working on the development of radar.

Laya Wiesner  widow of late MIT president  dies at 79; championed women on campus,CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Tuesday  Sept. 29 -- Laya W. Wiesner  79  of Watertown  civic leader and champion of an expanded role for women at MIT and widow of MIT's thirteenth president  Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner  died Monday night (Sept. 28) in Mt. Auburn Hospital of complications from polymyositis  a degenerative muscular disease."Laya Wiesner was a remarkable woman with an indomitable spirit " said Catherine M. Stratton  widow of MIT's eleventh president  Julius. "She was incredibly courageous  allocating her energy to the causes which mattered most to her -- civil rights  mentoring MIT women students in the fields of science and engineering  and being a sparkling  creative partner to her husband."Dr. Wiesner  who died in 1994  was president of MIT from 1971 to 1980.Mrs. Wiesner was a founder and strong supporter of the Metropolitan Council on Education (METCO) program that brought minority children in Boston to suburban schools. She was a leader of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters  which she joined in 1952  and served as state chair for its Human Resources Committee from 1964-66. She helped organize the pioneering KLH Day Care Center in Cambridge  served on the Governor's Advisory Committee on Child Development in Massachusetts  and on the board of the Cambridge School of Weston.MIT President Charles M. Vest  noting that the Wiesners were a model leadership team  said  "I admired her for her leadership in the Boston area  and for her dedication to making MIT a broadly creative and caring institution."Rebecca M. Vest  the present First Lady of MIT  said she felt honored to present the Laya W. Wiesner award annually to the undergraduate woman who has done the most to enhance MIT community life "Laya never lost her abiding interest and love of the students here " said Mrs. Vest. "She was a gentle  intelligent caring woman who will be greatly missed by the MIT community." Mrs. Wiesner had personally selected all 18 winners of the award  established in 1980 by the MIT Women's League.During the Wiesner presidency  she took an active  and often leadership  role in various MIT projects and activities  including the MIT Women's League  the advisory committee on women and work  and the advisory board of MIT's Child Development Center. In 1973  she helped organize the workshop on Women in Science and Technology  which brought together leaders from government  industry and education to address the challenges and opportunities in this area.She also met regularly with women on the faculty  acting as their "eyes and ears" while working to increase their numbers  recalled Priscilla K. Gray  whose husband  Paul  succeeded Dr. Wiesner as president of MIT. "She was aware of the issues and keen to get them on the table " said Mrs. Gray  who remembered her as "very kind and generous of spirit  a great lady. She was always concerned about people; she always asked about their families. She was a very caring person and she always knew what was going on here."Dr. Paul Gray also remembered Mrs. Wiesner for her bravery and commitment to principles  even while battling a debilitating disease  recalling how "she carried on with fortitude  good cheer and courage.""Laya Wiesner was a great first lady for MIT " said Elizabeth W. Johnson  whose husband  Howard  preceded Dr. Wiesner. "She had compassion  wide-ranging interests and a special concern for women at the Institute as well as in society. Her quiet courage and bravery in her last difficult years were admired by everyone who knew her."Mrs.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wiesner met her husband-to-be at the University of Michigan when she was an undergraduate. She married him in 1940 after she received the BS in mathematics and he completed most of his doctoral work in communications engineering.They came to MIT in 1942 when Dr. Wiesner joined the Radiation Laboratory  working on the development of radar. In 1961  they went to Washington upon his appointment as the Science Advisor to President John F. Kennedy. They returned to Cambridge in 1964 when he became dean of the School of Science at MIT. When Dr. Wiesner became president of MIT in 1971  the family chose to continue to live in their Watertown home rather than the President's House on the MIT campus."The official residence is magnificent for entertaining " she said  "but not ideally suited for family living.

Hoyt Hottel dies at 95; was expert on energy  combustion,Professor Emeritus Hoyt Clarke Hottel made fun of his tendency to procrastinate at a chemical engineering dinner in 1992 while quoting pianist/TV personality Victor Borge to show that it was not necessarily a bad trait."Plan to die young and keep planning " said Professor Hottel  who directed the Fuels Research Laboratory for 35 of his 76 years at MIT. "Just put off the act as long as possible."Professor Hottel  four weeks shy of his 90th birthday when he uttered those words  died August 18 of pancreatic cancer at his home in Winchester  MA. He was 95 years old.An only child  he was born on January 15  1903 in Salem  IN  and grew up near St. Louis. He once recalled watching Halley's Comet from his family's backyard on April 21  1910  the day Mark Twain died. At the time  he remembered  "I thought I would never see Halley again because it would be another 76 years." He did  of course.Professor Hottel  who finished high school at age 15  came to MIT in 1922 after receiving the BS in chemistry from the University of Indiana. He never left. After receiving the SM in chemical engineering in 1924  he served as director of the School of Chemical Engineering Practice (now called the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice) for a year and was an Institute Fellow in fuel and gas engineering for two years. He was named an assistant professor in 1928  associate professor in 1931 and full professor in 1941. In 1965 he was named the first Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering. He became professor emeritus in 1968.MIT instituted the Hoyt C. Hottel Lectureship in 1985 and he delivered the inaugural lecture. The Hoyt C. Hottel Professorship in chemical engineering  established in 1995  is held by Professor Jack B. Howard.An expert on fuels  combustion  radiant heat transmission and industrial furnaces  Professor Hottel co-authored three books  contributed sections to 15 others and wrote more than 150 technical papers while acquiring eight patents. He was a thesis advisor to Charles Stark Draper.TEACHING PRINCIPLESDuring that 1992 chemical engineering dinner  Professor Hottel shared with the audience a brief summary of his principles of teaching: "Beware that a student's spirit be not done to death by a formula  by teaching with answers cast in concrete. Be less concerned with technical content and timeliness -- I said less concerned  not unconcerned -- and less concerned with the completeness of coverage of your subject than with stretching the student's mind and stimulating him to self-teaching  hopefully continued through life."In addition to his classroom duties  Professor Hottel was an original member and acting director of the Fuels Research Laboratory from 1929-34  when he was named director. He served in that capacity until 1968. He also chaired the MIT Research Committee on Solar Energy from 1938-64  and built three solar houses.During World War II  he was chief of the National Defense Research Committee group that studied and developed incendiaries. He chaired the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project Panel on Thermal Radiation from 1949-56. In 1948  Professor Hottel received the Medal for Merit  a civilian award  for "exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States" for his World War II service. The British government honored him for his role in the war with the King's Medal for Service to the Cause of Freedom.From 1956-67 he chaired the National Academy of Sciences Fire Research committee  which studied tactics to fight large fires  including forest fires and fire storms in urban areas. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.Professor Hottel received many distinguished professional awards  including the Sir Alfred Egerton Gold Medal from the Combustion Institute (which he co-founded) and the Melchett Medal from the Institute of Fuel in Great Britain. He received the Max Jakob Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1966 and the Founders Award from the Institute of Chemical Engineers the next year. In 1975 he received the Farrington Daniels Award of the International Solar Energy Society. He was the founder and first chair of the American Flame Research Committee.After he retired from MIT  Professor Hottel taught and lectured at many universities overseas  including the University of Newcastle inNew South Wales  Australia. He served on the National Academy of Sciences advisory group on Brazil and lectured on energy-related topics in South Africa. A grandchild often accompanied the Hottels on their overseas trips.Professor Hottel was among 55 scientists from 13 countries who volunteered to visit the Soviet Union in 1984 as "good-faith witnesses" to guarantee the return of ailing dissident Yelena Bonner if she were allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. Dr.Bonner and her husband  Andrei Sakharov  were banished to the city of Gorky in 1980 after criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He never visited the Soviet Union.DIVERSE HOBBIESAway from academia  Professor Hottel took great pride in his extensive vegetable and flower gardens. He was a prodigious and skilled woodworker who built two beautiful hardwood coffee tables and crafted his own Christmas decorations over the years. He also built kayaks for his daughters to paddle on Mystic Lake where they lived. One of his proudest achievements was climbing Mount Teton in Wyoming with several younger MIT colleagues when he was 50 years old."He was a man of so many interests " recalled his daughter  Lois H. Wood of Lebanon  NH. "Classical music certainly was at the top of his list -- he enjoyed the Boston Symphony regularly with my mother  a singer  for as many years as I can remember. He had a nearly perfect ear  and could sing any song using the diatonic scale. Any song."For fun  he wrote  photographed and edited two movies with his MIT colleagues and the MIT Drama Club  "Clementine" in 1934 and "Henry's Wooling" in 1937.Professor Hottel was a member of Phi Beta Kappa  Sigma Xi  Tau Beta Pi and Alpha Chi Sigma honor societies and the Indiana University chapter of Phi Gamma Delta. He was an active member of the Winchester Unitarian Church.The family summered on Sutton Island in Maine and Professor Hottel was a member of the Harbor Club in Seal Harbor for 30 years.In addition to his daughter  Lois  Professor Hottel is survived by a son  Hoyt Jr.  known as Clarke  of Mattapoisett  MA; two other daughters  Barbara H. Willis of Severna Park  MD  and Elizabeth H. Barrett of San Diego; 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. Professor Hottel's wife of 65 years  the former Nellie L. Rich of Boston  died in 1994.A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday  Sept. 12  at the Winchester Unitarian Church  Mystic Street  Winchester  MA.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon September 26  1998.

George Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi  renowned organic chemist  dies at age 77,Professor Emeritus George H. Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi of Cambridge  MA  and Jackson  NH  one of this century's foremost organic chemists  died of heart failure while hiking with his wife in his native Switzerland on August 28 at the age of 77. He was an avid hiker  hunter  skier and fisherman.Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi  born on Aug. 1  1921 in Baden  received a diploma in chemical engineering in 1945 from Eidgenoss-ische Technische Hoch-schule in Zurich and the DSc in organic chemistry in 1947  working in the laboratory of Professor Leopold Ruzicka. He was a Firestone Postdoctoral Fellow in the Laboratory of Professor M. Karasch at the University of Chicago for three years before accepting a faculty appointment from MIT in 1951.He was promoted to associate professor in 1956 and to full professor in 1958  and was appointed the Camille and Henry Dreyfus professor of chemistry in 1971 (established in memory of the Swiss-born chemists who pioneered polymer research and founded the Celanese Corp.)  a position he held until his retirement in 1991. During his tenure at MIT  Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi trained 70 PhDs and more than 100 postdoctoral students  many of whom have gone on to leadership positions in academia and industry around the world.Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi was chosen for MIT's prestigious James R. Killian Jr. Award and Lecture (named after MIT's 10th president) in 1991. At that time  a colleague described him "as one of the best scientists at MIT  and one of the most human." The citation with the award read: "George H. Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi  MIT faculty member for nearly 40 years  has set an unprecedented standard in organic chemistry. His contributions in research and education have added to the quality of life globally  and his colleagues and students have derived direct benefit from his wisdom  dedication to excellence and friendship."Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi's research made significant contributions in diverse areas of organic chemistry. His work in the 1950s in organic photochemistry was instrumental in converting this latent field into an understandable and useful synthetic tool  and it laid the groundwork for what is now modern organic photochemistry. He was responsible for the structure determination of more than 55 natural products and the synthesis of over 75 complex natural products. His syntheses were considered creative  elegant and original.In addition  many of his syntheses covered in the more than 200 papers from his laboratory were very efficient in producing quantities of the target compound in very few steps. Most notable in the area of molecular toxicology was his work in collaboration with Professor Gerald Wogan on aflatoxins  carcinogenic fungal metabolites initially isolated from spoiled peanuts.Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi's group not only isolated and determined structures of the toxic compounds  but also completed the total synthesis of many members of the new structural class. He then went on to work with Professors Wogan and John Essigmann to deduce the mechanism responsible for the carcinogenic properties of aflatoxins. Work in the area of molecular toxicology continued with isolation and structures of several mycotoxins and mutagens.Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965  he was recognized throughout his career with numerous awards  honorary degrees and lectureships from around the world. Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi was a consultant for Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in both the US and Switzerland and for Firmenich SA in Switzerland  and he held more than 30 US patents with these companies and on his own.Professor Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi is survived by his wife of 43 years  Anne (Barkman) of Cambridge and Jackson  NH; a brother  Heinrich  of Berne  Switzerland; and three nephews  all of whom live in Switzerland. Services were private.Donations in his memory may be sent to the George H. Bï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½chi Lectureship Fund (established in 1988) at the Department of Chemistry  Rm 18-390  77 Massachusetts Avenue  Cambridge  MA 02139  Attn: N. Tahsin.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon September 16  1998.
Segal of mathematics dies at 79,Professor Emeritus Irving Segal  79  a pioneer in the fields of functional analysis and harmonic analysis  died unexpectedly while walking near his home in Lexington  MA  on August 30. The cause of death was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.An MIT faculty member for 38 years  Professor Segal was one of the Department of Mathematics' most dedicated teachers  contributing significantly to the review and upgrading of its curriculum. He was advisor to a number of outstanding graduate students  among them MIT professors Isadore Singer and Bertram Kostant (now emeritus) and Princeton professor Edward Nelson."His encouragement was strong when I was writing a thesis " Professor Nelson recalled in an introduction to the 1983 book Studies in Applied Mathematics  which is dedicated to Professor Segal  "and equally important was his total lack of encouragement when I found a result unrelated to anything beyond itself. This sense of the global nature of mathematical research is one of the most valuable things that he imparts to his students."Born in the Bronx on Sept. 13  1918  Professor Segal was raised in Trenton  NJ  and received the BA from Princeton in 1937 and the PhD from Yale in 1940  both in mathematics. He was an instructor at Harvard University in 1941 and a research associate at Princeton from 1941-43 before entering the US Army as an enlisted man. After military service during which he performed ballistics research at the Aberdeen (MD) Proving Grounds  Professor Segal did research work at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1945-48 before moving to the University of Chicago. He was an assistant professor from 1948-53  an associate professor from 1953-57 and a full professor from 1957-60. He came to MIT in 1960 as a professor of mathematics and assumed emeritus status in 1989.Early in his career  Professor Segal was concerned with applications of algebraic methods to fundamental physics  in particular to the foundations of quantum field theory. In 1947 he introduced a system of postulates for general quantum mechanics which reworked a number of key concepts in quantum theory and spawned a great deal of active research.He was able to generalize major portions of the seminal work of Norbert Wiener. His theory of non-commutative integration provided an extraordinary generalization of the Plancherel theorem for the Fourier transform to general (cq) locally compact groups.More recently  Professor Segal pursued applications of his "chronometric theory" to various studies in astrophysics  leading to a parameter-free theory of the red-shift and an alternative model of the universe.Professor Segal  a member of the American Astronomical  Mathematical  and Physical Societies  was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences  and the National Academy of Sciences. A three-time John Simon Guggenheim Fellow (1947  1951 and 1967) and recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Award in 1981  he was a founder and managing editor of the Journal of Functional Analysis and authored three books and more than 200 papers.Professor Segal had visiting professorships at universities around the world  including Columbia  La Sorbonne  Lund University  University of Pisa  Aarhus University  College de France  Institute of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics  Copenhagen  and the University of Moscow. He loved both jazz and classical music.Professor Segal is survived by his wife  Dr. Martha (Fox) Segal of Lexington; their eight-year-old daughter  Miriam  of Lexington; three children from an earlier marriage  William of Bethesda  MD  Andrew of Espinola  NM  and Karen of New York City; and four grandchildren. His first wife  Osa MacLane of Chicago  mother of William  Andrew and Karen  also survives.A memorial gathering was held at MIT yesterday. Burial was private.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon September 16  1998.

MIT professor George Büchi dies at 77; was renowned organic chemist,MIT Professor emeritus George H. Büchi of Cambridge  MA  and Jackson  NH  77  one of this century's foremost organic chemists  died of heart failure while hiking with his wife in his native Switzerland on Aug. 28. He was an avid hiker  hunter  skier and fisherman.Professor Büchi  born on Aug. 1  1921 in Baden  received a diploma in chemical engineering in 1945 from Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule in Zurich and the DSc in organic chemistry in 1947  working in the laboratory of Professor Leopold Ruzicka.Professor Büchi was a Firestone Postdoctoral Fellow in the Laboratory of Professor M. Karasch at the University of Chicago for three years before accepting a faculty appointment from MIT in 1951. He was promoted to associate professor in 1956 and to full professor in 1958  and was appointed the Camile and Henry Dreyfus professor of chemistry in 1971 (established in memory of the Swiss-born chemists who pioneered polymer research and founded the Celanese Corp)  a position he held until his retirement in 1991. During his tenure at MIT  Professor Büchi trained 70 PhDs and more than l00 post-doctoral students  many of whom have gone on to leadership positions in academia and industry around the world.Professor Büchi was chosen for MIT's prestigious James R. Killian Jr. Award and Lecture (named after MIT's 10th president) in 1991. At that time  a colleague described him "as one of the best scientists at MIT  and one of the most human." The citation with the award read: "George H. Büchi  MIT faculty member for nearly 40 years  has set an unprecedented standard in organic chemistry. His contributions in research and education have added to the quality of life globally  and his colleagues and students have derived direct benefit from his wisdom  dedication to excellence  and friendship."Professor Büchi's research made significant contributions in diverse areas of organic chemistry. His work in the 1950s in organic photochemistry was instrumental in converting this latent field into an understandable and useful synthetic tool and laid the groundwork for what is now modern organic photochemistry. He was responsible for the structure determination of over 55 natural products and the synthesis of over 75 complex natural products.His syntheses were considered creative  elegant and original. In addition  many of his syntheses covered in the over 200 papers from his laboratory were very efficient in producing quantities of the target compound in very few steps. Most notable in the area of molecular toxicology was his work in collaboration with MIT Professor Gerald Wogan on aflatoxins  carcinogenic fungal metabolites initially isolated from spoiled peanuts.His group not only isolated and determined structures of the toxic compounds  but also completed the total synthesis of many members of the new structural class. He then went on to work with Professors Wogan and John Essigmann to deduce the mechanism responsible for the carcinogenic properties of aflatoxins. Work in the area of molecular toxicology continued with isolation and structures of several mycotoxins and mutagens.Professor Büchi was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965 and was recognized throughout his career with numerous awards  honorary degrees and lectureships from around the world. He was a highly valued consultant for Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in both the US and Switzerland and for Firmenich SA in Switzerland and held more than 30 US patents with these companies and on his own.Professor Büchi is survived by his wife of 43 years  Anne (Barkman) of Cambridge and Jackson  NH; a brother  Heinrich  of Berne  Switzerland  and three nephews  all of whom live in Switzerland. Services were private.Donations in his memory may be sent to the George H. Büchi Lectureship Fund (established in 1988) at the MIT Department of Chemistry.

Math professor Irving Segal dies at 79; was on MIT faculty for 38 years,CAMBRIDGE  MA-- MIT Professor Emeritus Irving Segal  79  a pioneer in the fields of functional analysis and harmonic analysis  died unexpectedly while walking near his home in Lexington  MA  on Sunday evening (Aug. 30).An MIT faculty member for 38 years  Professor Segal was one of the Department of Mathematics' most dedicated teachers  contributing significantly to the review and upgrading of its curriculum. He was advisor to a number of outstanding graduate students  among them MIT professors Isadore Singer and Bertram Kostant (now emeritus) and Princeton professor Edward Nelson."His encouragement was strong when I was writing a thesis " Professor Nelson recalled in the 1983 book Studies in Applied Mathematics  which is dedicated to Professor Segal  "and equally important was his total lack of encouragement when I found a result unrelated to anything beyond itself. This sense of the global nature of mathematical research is one of the most valuable things that he imparts to his students."Born in the Bronx on Sept. 13  1918  Professor Segal was raised in Trenton  NJ  and received the BA from Princeton in 1937 and the PhD from Yale in 1940  both in mathematics. He was an instructor at Harvard University in 1941 and a research associate at Princeton from 1941-43 before entering the US Army as an enlisted man. After military service during which he performed ballistics research at the Aberdeen (MD) Proving Grounds  Professor Segal did research work at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1945-48 before moving to the University of Chicago. He was an assistant professor from 1948-53  an associate professor from 1953-57 and a full professor from 1957-60. He came to MIT in 1960 as a professor of mathematics and assumed emeritus status in 1989.Early in his career  Professor Segal was concerned with applications of algebraic methods to fundamental physics  in particular to the foundations of quantum field theory. In 1947 he introduced a system of postulates for general quantum mechanics which reworked a number of key concepts in quantum theory and spawned a great deal of active research.He was able to generalize major portions of the seminal work of Norbert Wiener. His theory of non-commutative integration provided an extraordinary generalization of the Plancherel theorem for the Fourier transform to general (cq) locally compact groups.More recently  Professor Segal pursued applications of his "chronometric theory" to various studies in astrophysics  leading to a parameter-free theory of the red-shift and an alternative model of the universe.Professor Segal  a member of the American Astronomical  Mathematical  and Physical Societies  was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences  and the National Academy of Sciences. A three-time John Simon Guggenheim Fellow (1947  1951  and 1967) and recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Award in 1981  he was a founder and managing editor of the Journal of Functional Analysis and authored three books and more than 200 papers.Professor Segal had visiting professorships at universities around the world  including Columbia  La Sorbonne  Lund University  University of Pisa  Aarhus University College de France  Institute of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics  Copenhagen  and the University of Moscow. He loved both jazz and classical music.Professor Segal is survived by his wife  Dr. Martha (Fox) Segal of Lexington; their 6-year-old daughter  Miriam  of Lexington; three children from an earlier marriage  William of Bethesda  MD  Andrew of Espinola  NM  and Karen of New York City; and four grandchildren. His first wife  Osa MacLane of Chicago  mother of William  Andrew and Karen  also survives.A memorial service will be held at MIT in mid-September.

MIT professor Hoyt Hottel dies at age 95; was expert on energy  fuels and combustion,MIT Professor Emeritus Hoyt Clarke Hottel made fun of his tendency to procrastinate at a chemical engineering dinner in 1992 while quoting pianist/TV personality Victor Borge to show that it was not necessarily a bad trait."Plan to die young and keep planning " said Professor Hottel  who directed the MIT Fuels Research Laboratory for 35 of his 76 years at MIT. "Just put off the act as long as possible."Professor Hottel  four weeks shy of his 90th birthday when he uttered those words  died Tuesday of pancreatic cancer at his home in Winchester  MA. He was 95 years old.An only child  he was born on January 15  1903 in Salem  IN  and grew up near St. Louis  MO. He once recalled watching Halley's Comet from his family's backyard on April 21  1910  the day Mark Twain died. At the time  he remembered ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"I thought I would never see Halley again because it would be another 76 years." He did  of course.Professor Hottel   who finished high school at age 15  came to MIT in 1922 after receiving the BS in chemistry from the University of Indiana. He never left. After receiving the SM in chemical engineering in 1924  he served as director of the School of Chemical Engineering Practice (now called the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice) for a year and was an Institute Fellow in fuel and gas engineering for two years. He was named an assistant professor in 1928  associate professor in 1931 and fullï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½professor in 1941. In 1965 he was named the first Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering. He became professor emeritus in 1968.MIT instituted the Hoyt C. Hottel Lectureship in 1985 and he delivered the inaugural lecture. The Hoyt C. Hottel chair in chemical engineering  established in 1995  is held by Professor Jack B. Howard.An expert on fuels  combustion  radiant heat transmission and industrial furnaces  Professor Hottel co-authored three books  contributed sections to 15 others and wrote more than 150 technical papers while acquiring eight patents. He was a thesis advisor to Charles Stark Draper.During that 1992 chemical engineering dinner  Professor Hottel shared with the audience a brief summary of his principles of teaching: "Beware that a student's spirit be not done to death by a formula  by teaching with answers cast in concrete. Be less concerned with technical content and timeliness -- I said less concerned  not unconcerned -- and less concerned with the completeness of coverage of your subject than with stretching the student's mind and stimulating him to self-teaching  hopefully continued through life."In addition to his classroom duties  Professor Hottel was an original member and acting director of the Fuels Research Laboratory from 1929-34 when he was named director. He served in that capacity until 1968. He also chaired the MIT Research Committee on Solar Energy from 1938-64  and built three solar houses.During World War II  he was chief of the National Defense Research Committee group that studied and developed incendiaries. He chaired the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project Panel on Thermal Radiation from 1949-56. Professor Hottel received the Medal for Merit  a civilian award  in 1948 for "exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States" for his World War II service. The British government honored him for his role in the war with the King's Medal for Service to the Cause of Freedom.From 1956-67 he chaired the National Academy of Sciences Fire Research committee  which studied tactics to fight large fires  including forest fires and fire storms in urban areas. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.Professor Hottel received many distinguished professional awards  including the Sir Alfred Egerton Gold Medal from the Combustion Institute (which he co-founded) and the Melchett Medal from the Institute of Fuel in Great Britain. He received the Max Jakob award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1966 and the Founders Award from the Institute of Chemical Engineers the next year. In 1975 he received the Farrington Daniels Award of the International Solar Energy Society. He was the founder and first chair of the American Flame Research Committee.After he retired from MIT  Professor Hottel taught and lectured at many universities overseas  including the University of Newcastle in New South Wales  Australia. He served on the National Academy of Sciences advisory group on Brazil and lectured on energy-related topics in South Africa. A grandchild often accompanied the Hottels on their overseas trips.Professor Hottel was among 55 scientists from 13 countries who volunteered to visit the Soviet Union in 1984 as "good faith witnesses" to guarantee the return of ailing dissident Yelena Bonner if she were allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. Dr. Bonner and her husband  Andrei Sakharov  were banished to the city of Gorky in 1980 after criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He never visited the Soviet Union.Away from academia  Professor Hottel took great pride in his extensive vegetable and flower gardens. He was a prodigious and skilled woodworker who built two beautiful hardwood coffee tables and crafted his own Christmas decorations over the years. He also built kayaks for his daughters to paddle on Mystic Lake where they lived. One of his proudest achievements was climbing Mount Teton in Wyoming with several younger MIT colleagues when he was 50 years old."He was a man of so many interests " recalled his daughter  Lois H. Wood of Lebanon  NH. "Classical music certainly was at the top of his list -- he enjoyed the Boston Symphony regularly with my mother  a singer  for as many years as I can remember. He had a nearly perfect ear  and could sing any song using the diatonic scale. Any song."For fun  he wrote  photographed and edited two movies with his MIT colleagues and the MIT Drama Club  "Clementine" in 1934 and "Henry's Wooling" in 1937.Professor Hottel was a member ofï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Phi Beta Kappa  Sigma Xi  Tau Beta Pi and Alpha Chi Sigma honor societies and the Indiana University chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.  He was an active member of the Winchester Unitarian Church.The family summered on Sutton Island in Maine and Professor Hottel was a member of the Harbor Club in Seal Harbor for 30 years.In addition to his daughter  Lois  Professor Hottel is survived by a son  Hoyt Jr.  known as Clarke  of Mattapoisett  MA; two other daughters  Barbara H. Willis of Severna Park  MD  and Elizabeth H. Barrett of San Diego; 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. Professor Hottel's wife of 65 years  the former Nellie L. Rich of Boston  died in 1994.A memorial service will be held at 11 am on Saturday  Sept. 12  at the Winchester Unitarian Church  Mystic Street  Winchester  MA.

Student dies in fall from Bldg 54,A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel tomorrow at 3pm for Philip C. Gale  a sophomore music major who fell to his death from a 15th-floor classroom in Building 54 last Friday evening. Campus Police said it was an apparent suicide. A reception will follow in the Mezzanine Lounge (third floor of Student Center).Mr. Gale  19  a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity  shared a Cambridge apartment with two fraternity brothers. Originally from Charlotte  NC  Mr. Gale also lived in California  Utah and Oregon.Campus police  the Professional Ambulance advanced life support unit and an MIT employee tried to revive Mr. Gale at the scene. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Massachusetts General Hospital at 7:57pm. The Middlesex County Medical Examiner ruled that death resulted from multiple traumatic injuries.Because of the location and the time of day  many students witnessed the event. They told Campus Police that Mr. Gale broke a window with a chair and cleared away the shards before leaping.Senior Associate Dean Robert Randolph issued a statement on Saturday reporting the incident to the MIT community. The news also was sent via e-mail to housemasters and graduate residential tutors and reported on the News Office web page.In reporting the event  Dean Randolph said  "We urge students and other members of the MIT community who need counseling to call the Medical Department (x3-4481) and ask for the psychiatrist on call  or the Counseling Support Service (x3-4861)."Mr. Gale was 15 when he enrolled at MIT in 1994 after graduating from the Delphian Academy in Oregon  intending to major in physics. He left the next year to become director of research and development for the Earthlink Network  an Internet service provider.Mr. Gale  who played the drums  returned to MIT in 1996 and was majoring in music. Last fall  he took a course taught by Media Laboratory Professor Tod Machover  Musical Aesthetics and Media Technology. Professor Machover recalled him as "a quiet  serious  unusual  talented and brilliant young man."I am deeply saddened by Phil's passing  and will very much miss the opportunity to work with him more closely and get to know him better  and to watch his ideas and dreams blossom into the mature and important contributions that I sense they would have become " said Professor Machover  the creator of Brain Opera  which has received widespread recognition.Although Mr. Gale didn't speak much in class  "I knew from his comments and midterm paper that he had absorbed  digested and personalized the ample reading and listening assignments concerning the techniques and concepts of electronic and computer music " Professor Machover said.He encouraged Mr. Gale to design a UROP project for the Hyperinstru-ments/Opera of the Future group. "As seemed typical of Phil  he went his own way  and after three months of not hearing from him  he got back to me just last week with another completely different idea for a UROP project " Professor Machover said.Mr. Gale proposed to develop a way to analyze diverse sounds  among them crowd noises  nature sounds and machines clanging  permitting them to be organized and associated according to rhythmic  loudness  and coloristic similarities. "The idea was great  and very much in line with some of the more ambitious hopes that our group has for the future of music " Professor Machover said. "Phil was going to start work on the project right away  and I have no doubt that it would have yielded spectacular and unexpected results."Upon returning to MIT as a music major  Mr. Gale performed with the MIT Concert Choir and the Gamelan Galek Tika  a percussion group which plays traditional Balinese music.Mr. Gale is survived by his mother  Marie  of Broadbent  OR  and a sister  Elizabeth.

Prof. Harold Freeman of economics dies at 88,Harold A. Freeman  professor emeritus of statistics in the Department of Economics  died at home in Andover at the age of 88. He was a graduate of MIT (SB '31) and spent most of his academic career at the Institute.Born in Wilkes-Barre  PA  Professor Freeman majored in mathematics at MIT and was an instructor in economics before studying at Har-vard University from 1936-38. He returned to MIT as an assistant professor in 1939  winning promotion to associate professor in 1944 and full professor in 1950. He retired from that post in 1976 but continued as a senior lecturer for 14 years.Professor Freeman was a member of the Statistical Research Group assembled at Columbia University during World War II to devise methods of sampling inspection and quality control for use in wartime industry. He was co-author of several important books to emerge from that work  notably Sequential Analysis of Statistical Data: Applications (1945) and Sampling Inspection (1948). He produced two other statistical books during his MIT career; after retiring  he wrote books of social criticism  including Towards Socialism in America (1982).Professor Freeman served as a consultant to the US Army and governmental agencies including the Department of Health  Education and Welfare and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as the Royal Statistical Society  the American Statistical Association (of which he also served as vice president) and the American Society for Quality Control.He leaves his long-time companion Kathleen Adams; two sons  Arthur of London and Edward of California; and his former wife  Margaret of Belmont. A memorial service will be held at MIT at a date to be announced.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon November 26  1997.
Friends and family bid farewell to Micheletti at MIT service,Family and friends of Michele Micheletti from California joined her MIT friends Sunday afternoon for a memorial service of songs  poems and fond remembrances of the sophomore who was killed October 31 while crossing Memorial Drive.Charles Morton (SB '97)  Ms. Micheletti's friend from New House 3  and Jocelyne Takatsuno of Mt. Holyoke College  who knew her from high school  welcomed those who came for "Remembering Michele."They were joined in giving tribute by President Charles M. Vest; Professor John Essigmann  housemaster of New House; Paul Parravano  her freshman advisor; Professor Markus Zahn  her Course 6 advisor; Deans Margaret Bates and Robert Randolph; and more than a dozen others who shared their memories of Ms. Micheletti with an overflowing crowd in Wong Auditorium."I have rarely known of anyone  of any age  who had such a profound  personal effect on so many people. It seems that her heart embraced the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ her legacy of love and caring will find enduring expression in the lives of all her friends  as well as her family " said President Vest."Mr. and Mrs. Micheletti  we hope that this gathering today will bring comfort to you  just as the services in California  and your welcoming of our students there  brought so much comfort to them " he said to Shirley and Elmer Micheletti  who attended the service along with their son Michael and Ms. Micheletti's aunt and uncle  Mary and John Micheletti.Professor Essigmann and Mr. Parravano of the Government and Community Relations Office  along with 31 MIT students  traveled to Millbrae  CA  earlier this month for the funeral. At the service in St. Dunstan's Church  "we were amazed to see how many awards she had won. She won every honor available in her community " said Professor Essigmann.Sunday's presentations paid tribute to Ms. Micheletti's ubiquitous smile  abundant optimism and lifetime of academic honors and community service  as well as to her practicality."Her rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sumï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ lists more than three pages of accomplishments. But the last thing on itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ tells us that she had a paper route for four years. And you can tell from the conspicuous way she presents this information she was very proud to have been the holder of Route 09-523-14 for the San Mateo Times. This statement shows how down to earth Michele was " said Professor Essigmann  a MacVicar Fellow and professor of chemistry and toxicology.Relating some of his feelings from the evening of her death  Professor Essigmann described entering her room with his passkey and seeing on her computer screen the Eudora message saying she had new e-mail."There they were  all lined up  messages from friends -- little blue dot after little blue dot. I am a mere Course 5  not a lofty Course 6; I didn't know how to forward them up to where I know she was at that time. So I just logged out  for the last time. I think it is the MIT nerd's definition of faith to believe she got their messages anyway " he said.The memorial service ended with a video montage of still photos and film clips of Ms. Micheletti from childhood. The images of the smiling little girl standing with a group of little friends in pajamas or riding a bicycle with training wheels underscored the brief span of her life.The Metropolitan District Commission painted a crosswalk at the intersection of Memorial Drive and Endicott Street after Ms. Micheletti's death. She was struck by two cars while trying to cross from the center island to the river  on her way to dinner with friends on Halloween night. She died that same evening. MIT officials and students had been advocating a crosswalk at that location for several years prior to the accident.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon November 26  1997.
Micheletti memorial service set,A memorial service for sophomore Michele Micheletti  who was killed October 31 when she was struck by two cars while crossing Memorial Drive  will be held on Sunday  Nov. 23 at 1:30pm in Wong Auditorium (corner of Amherst and Wadsworth Streets). Her parents  Elmer and Shirley Micheletti  will attend the service.A group of Ms. Micheletti's friends have written an open letter thanking members of the MIT administration for their support following her death. The text of the letter follows.To Whom It May Concern:On Friday  October 31  1997  the loss of Michele Micheletti struck the MIT community. It especially struck all those who in one way or another knew Michele and were touched by the love she spread to all around her. This love  which saw no color  no race  no differences  was a never-ending fountain of happiness  inspiration  and joy  which we were blessed to have known.Losing her was very painful and difficult for many of us to handle. However  the MIT administration was a powerful and effective force which provided strength  leadership  and guidance for all of us. We wish to thank Dean Osgood  Dean Henderson  Dean Bates  Dean Randolph  Professor John Essigmann  Ellen Essigmann  Paul Parravano  Charles Vest  the counseling department  the chaplain's office  and the Medical Department and MedLINKS. They all worked together to provide a solid foundation for those of us affected by the passing of Michele.It was on October 31 that Michele passed away  November 1 when the news spread  and November 4 that a group composed of 26 students  two faculty members and a floor tutor were on a plane heading to San Francisco in order to attend Michele's funeral.If there is one great gift which can be bestowed upon any person  it is the gift of bidding farewell to those we love. Upon our arrival in San Francisco  we attended Michele's wake. We then attended a rosary service for Michele at St. Dunstan's Parish  where Michele had spent her elementary school years.The next day  we accompanied Michele's friends and family to the funeral and burial services. Every moment  we felt like we were part of her family  sharing our thoughts  grievances  prayers  stories and laughter with family members and friends. Michele's mother said that one of Michele's goals had been accomplished with our presence: Michele had managed to bring the East Coast to the West Coast.Our visit was incredibly meaningful to all of us. When you love somebody and that person leaves you  the pain of their absence is like an open wound. But the process of healing this wound began when we arrived in California. Michele's family was not only happy to see us  but they were filled with joy to see how many lives Michele had touched in such a short time.One of Michele's favorite phrases was Mi Amore  because that was exactly what she felt and expressed to all around her. She was the pride and joy of those who knew her  an exceptional person filled with qualities which many of us can only dream of. As Oscar Wilde once said  "To live is very rare. Most people exist  that is all." Michele not only existed  she lived and she helped us to live. She taught us the lessons of love without barriers and giving unselfishly of oneself.The opportunity to travel to California granted to us more than we can fully express in words. We were able to communicate our feelings and love to Michele's family and to begin to lift the veil of sadness which had covered us. We saw the tremendous accomplishments which Michele had achieved before she arrived at MIT. We realized that Michele had lived a fuller life in 19 years than some people can live in a hundred.We wish to express sincere gratitude to Dean Randolph and everyone who worked with him to make this trip possible. The generosity and caring he showed us are far above and beyond what was expected. This trip has touched all of our lives  and we truly thank Dean Randolph for enabling us to have had this experience.Sincerely Ricci Rivera  Rosie Alegado  Damon Lewis  Shelby Savage  William Melendez  Sam Wong  Baruch Feldman  Jackie Baskin  David Dunmeyer  Ana Karina Claudio  Jennifer Grewen  Charles Morton  Anjli Chokriwala  Susan Rosenthal  Alberto Cividanes  Shawn Atlow  Xilonin Cruz  Allison Waingold  Danielle Hinton  Jomaquai Jenkins  Kareem Benjamin  Marcus Baynes  Debbie Cheng  Helen Hsu  Anna Orenstein and Aleksandra Markina.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon November 19  1997.

Family and friends remember Basha's enthusiasm  affection,Umaer Basha  in many ways  was the son every parent dreams of having. Serious but fun-loving  outgoing but soft-spoken  friendly  loving  intelligent  curious and compassionate  he quickly became a special person to his housemates in the East Campus dormitory.The life story of Mr. Basha  a freshman who died in Chicago Children's Hospital on September 24 after fainting and accidentally drowning in a shower enclosure during his first visit home  is a tale of youthful exuberance  intellectual curiosity  a thirst for knowledge and a healthy respect for education.These traits endeared him to his friends and the faculty at Lake Forest High School in Illinois. Whether it was learning to play the violin  studying chemistry or physics  tutoring classmates or observing the Hale-Bopp comet  Umaer's enthusiasm about learning was contagious. Likening Mr. Basha to his beloved Hale-Bopp  a friend observed  "He will forever be the comet that passed through our lives briefly yet touched us deeply."Another friend  Justin Peters  wrote in the Lake Forest High School newspaper The Forest Scout of October 3: "Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½accomplished more in 18 years than some accomplish in a lifetime. Every action of his life showed this: his grades  his extracurriculars  his strength of character. He lived every day as if it were his last."But outside his hometown  the tragedy of Mr. Basha's accidental death was compounded when it became a footnote to the "big story" of binge and underage drinking on college campuses. He and his family deserve better.For Umaer  matriculation at MIT represented both a homecoming and a dream come true. His mother Fatima  a postdoctoral fellow from Pakistan  worked until midnight in an MIT chemistry laboratory on the night before he was born on April 20  1979. Two weeks later  she was carrying the infant back and forth across the Harvard Bridge while she continued her experiments. His father  Anwer  was also a postdoctoral fellow at MIT when Umaer was born.The family bond and the relationship with MIT provide a subtext to the love  admiration and mutual respect that permeates the e-mail correspondence between a mother and son away from home. All the letters begin with the traditional Moslem salutation: "Assalaamalaykum" (May God's blessing be with you).On August 28  shortly after he arrived on campus  Umaer reported that an eye exam went well and the doctor did not recommend that he get new glasses. "I think I will anyway " he said  "especially because the lecture halls are quite large here."Anticipating a visit from his mother and 9-year-old sister  Amina  he wrote  "I am 100 percent healthy  happy and looking forward to your arrival (mom and sis) and thinking about what to get for dad from here. It will be an incredibly exciting weekend  like seeing the start of a soccer game or something; when you first mix together the chemicals in one of your laboratory reactions and then wait for the results to come back."The next day  his mother replied:"This is a time of great joy and celebration from our end and pray that inshallah [God willing]  for you this will indeed be a lifetime-memorable living experience in all facets of your life. This was our dream  which your father and I shared together and by grace of God you with your unmatched gift for excellence made into reality. Now that you are surrounded by intelligent people  the best of all in their field at this great place of learning--we feel that our job is well done by God's help."In a September 1 letter  Umaer wrote that he thought of his mother whenever he looked out across Killian Court. "MIT says 360 credits are a circle " he said. "And I have come full circle around--from here where I was born back to here. And it might seem to me at times that life is full of circles. But it is not--it presses forward in helices  like in DNA."Now that my room is set and organized  I miss you even more and wish you were here. It is strange how we want these moments to never end. But in fact  I wish I was home as well. I know that you feel very close to me as I do to you  so it is silly for me to miss [you]."Always picture me studying and learning  as soon as tonight  and I see your love at the fundamental subatomic level--far greater a level than any more earthly love might encompass."In the same letter  Mr. Basha wrote  "As Dad said in his prayers before I left home  God has helped me through every single step to where I am now. I feel as though you've both lifted me to such incredible heights from which I must now further myself."Writing to his father on September 17  Mr. Basha noted that despite a bout with the flu and occasional homesick feelings  he was adjusting to life at MIT--"I'm beginning to feel at home here  too." Nonetheless  he was looking forward to a weekend visit to Lake Forest--"there's no place like home." He concluded this letter by thanking his mother for awakening him before dawn so he could witness the sunrise. "I really just wanted to rise with the sun (her sun/son) so that it might be sent over 1 000 miles west a little brighter."During that visit  he fainted in the shower at home and lapsed into a coma after his lungs filled with water. Doctors said the cause of death was accidental drowning. Ironically  in an essay entitled "H2O" that accompanied his application to MIT  Umaer described how he overcame his fear of water when he learned to swim during his sophomore year in high school."Being the son of two chemists " he wrote  "I learned the molecular formula of water at a very young age. Yet none of their example of benign contact with the life-substance could convince me  five years old  to take up swimming. Neither of them knew how to swim  so they let it go  and for years I avoided the sport." By learning how to swim in his teens  he said  "My understanding of water has matured. It's more than a drink  more than a shower--it's a livable medium."According to the Prophet of Islam  a person who drowns attains a state of martyrdom. The Koran says  "Martyrs are not dead. They are alive  but you are not aware of them."In a letter of recommendation to MIT written last December  Lake Forest High School English teacher Diane Clark called Mr. Basha "one of the most gifted thinkers I have encountered in my 17 years as an English teacher." She continued  "He is a good friend to all who know him  he has a delightfully dry sense of humor and his list of extracurricular activities speaks of a diversified  well-rounded person. Umaer is ready for the challenges and rewards that await him and will be a respected leader  a distinguished learner and a trusted friend--in short  an excellent addition to any institution."The high school will hold a memorial service on November 28 and plans to award a scholarship in Umaer's name. His parents  family and friends plan to establish a foundation to memorialize his life.

Inventor Jerome H. Lemelson dies at age 74,Jerome H. Lemelson  one of America's most prolific inventors and founder of the Lemelson-MIT Prize Program  died on October 1 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles at age 74. Mr. Lemelson  who resided in Incline Village  NV  died of liver cancer  according to his son  Eric.During a long career that began in the early 1950s  Mr. Lemelson received more than 500 US patents for his inventions. After the Patent Office finishes processing his most recent applications  he will likely have received more patents than any other American except Thomas Edison. His invention includes the drive mechanism for the audio cassette player  the automated warehouse  universal robots  machine vision and flexible manufacturing systems used to make products from integrated circuits to automobiles  the central innovation in the camcorder  and many others in fields ranging from electronics to toys to medical devices.A native of Staten Island  NY  Mr. Lemelson served in the US Army Air Corps during World War II  designing weapons systems and materials handling equipment for aircraft. He graduated from New York University in 1947 and earned master's degrees in aeronautical and industrial engineering from NYU in 1949 and 1951. Shortly thereafter  he struck out on his own as an independent inventor.In 1954  Mr. Lemelson filed for his first patents  though many of his inventions were not in widespread use for decades. He recently remarked that the Patent Office rejected his first attempt to patent the camcorder in 1977  because the examiner said it was ridiculous to think that video recorders could be miniaturized to the size required for portability.Almost alone among independent inventors  Mr. Lemelson made a living solely from royalties from his inventions. In 1974  he licensed patents for the audio cassette drive mechanism to Sony Corp.  which sublicensed the technology to more than 100 Asian companies. In 1981  IBM licensed some 20 Lemelson patents in the area of data and word-processing technology.Mr. Lemelson served on a federal advisory committee on patent issues from 1976-79. He recently opposed efforts to change US patent laws. (Many Nobel prize winners  including eight from MIT  have also publicly opposed the suggested changes -- see MIT Tech Talk  September 17  1997).In 1994  Mr. Lemelson and his wife Dorothy set up a charitable foundation to encourage invention and innovation in the United States. The Lemelson Foundation now supports the largest annual prize for invention ($500 000) in conjunction with MIT  based at the Sloan School of Management and directed by Lester C. Thurow  the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson professor of Management and Economics. The foundation has also funded invention programs at other colleges and universities and the Smithsonian Institution.Mr. Lemelson is survived by his wife  Dorothy; two sons  Eric of Portland  OR  and Robert of Los Angeles; two brothers  Howard of Connecticut and Justin of New York; and two grandchildren.-----------------Other obituariesKAPLAN MEMORIALA service to honor the memory of Professor Emeritus Irving Kaplan of nuclear engineering  who died last April 10 at the age of 84 (MIT Tech Talk  May 7  1997)  will be held at 3pm on Thursday  Oct. 23 in the MIT Chapel.

Krueger dies after 3 days in alcohol-induced coma,Eighteen-year old Scott Krueger  a freshman from Orchard Park  NY  died in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Monday night after three days in a coma  apparently induced by alcohol."The death of Scott Krueger  a bright and talented young man  is a terrible tragedy " President Charles Vest said. "Our hearts go out to the Krueger family. We will offer and be available for whatever support we can provide to them. It is our great regret that we can do little to ease their profound pain and grief."For Scott's fellow students  and the faculty and staff who had come to know him  this is a dreadful loss as well  and the MIT community will do all that we can to see that this kind of tragedy never happens here again."He had been discovered unconscious in his room by his fraternity brothers at Phi Gamma Delta  after drinking heavily at a fraternity event. Shortly before midnight Friday  the fraternity called Campus Police  who immediately called 911 to alert Boston Police and then went to the fraternity  which is located at 28 The Fenway. Mr. Krueger was unresponsive when Boston police  firefighters and paramedics arrived a few minutes later  and was taken by ambulance to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and placed on life support.His parents  Darlene and Robert Krueger  were notified and arrived at the hospital Saturday morning. He did not revive from the coma  and was taken off the life support systems on Monday and died at 6:40pm.Scott  who competed in lacrosse  soccer and wrestling at Orchard Park High School  was a candidate for the heavyweight crew. His intended major was mechanical engineering. He was among the top 10 students in a graduating class of 325."I can't say enough good things about Scott and would never connect him with peer pressure behavior " said Robert P. Farwell Jr.  principal of Orchard Park High School  who described Mr. Krueger as "a quiet leader."The principal said Scott excelled in math and recruited students to rescue an advanced chemistry class that was in danger of being canceled due to lack of interest."He was the least likely kind of guy to get in this kind of drinking situation " said Mr. Farwell. "But I guess you never know."Mr. Krueger is survived by his parents; an older sister  Kelly; a twin sister  Katie; and a younger brother  Jeff. Funeral arrangements have not yet been announced.TOXICOLOGY TESTSBoston police are investigating the cause of death and an autopsy will be performed. Toxicology tests will also be done to establish whether drugs were involved. "That doesn't mean we suspect drugs or foul play " said Boston Police Sgt. Margot Hill. "We always take a thorough look at the cause of death when it occurs under unknown circumstances." She said it takes three to four weeks to determine the results of toxicology tests.Boston police also have issued citations to the house for liquor and housing code violations.

Krueger dies after 3 days in alcohol-induced coma,Eighteen-year old Scott Krueger  a freshman from Orchard Park  NY  died in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Monday night after three days in a coma  apparently induced by alcohol."The death of Scott Krueger  a bright and talented young man  is a terrible tragedy " President Charles Vest said. "Our hearts go out to the Krueger family. We will offer and be available for whatever support we can provide to them. It is our great regret that we can do little to ease their profound pain and grief."For Scott's fellow students  and the faculty and staff who had come to know him  this is a dreadful loss as well  and the MIT community will do all that we can to see that this kind of tragedy never happens here again."He had been discovered unconscious in his room by his fraternity brothers at Phi Gamma Delta  after drinking heavily at a fraternity event. Shortly before midnight Friday  the fraternity called Campus Police  who immediately called 911 to alert Boston Police and then went to the fraternity  which is located at 28 The Fenway. Mr. Krueger was unresponsive when Boston police  firefighters and paramedics arrived a few minutes later  and was taken by ambulance to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and placed on life support.His parents  Darlene and Robert Krueger  were notified and arrived at the hospital Saturday morning. He did not revive from the coma  and was taken off the life support systems on Monday and died at 6:40pm.Scott  who competed in lacrosse  soccer and wrestling at Orchard Park High School  was a candidate for the heavyweight crew. His intended major was mechanical engineering. He was among the top 10 students in a graduating class of 325."I can't say enough good things about Scott and would never connect him with peer pressure behavior " said Robert P. Farwell Jr.  principal of Orchard Park High School  who described Mr. Krueger as "a quiet leader."The principal said Scott excelled in math and recruited students to rescue an advanced chemistry class that was in danger of being canceled due to lack of interest."He was the least likely kind of guy to get in this kind of drinking situation " said Mr. Farwell. "But I guess you never know."Mr. Krueger is survived by his parents; an older sister  Kelly; a twin sister  Katie; and a younger brother  Jeff. Funeral arrangements have not yet been announced.TOXICOLOGY TESTSBoston police are investigating the cause of death and an autopsy will be performed. Toxicology tests will also be done to establish whether drugs were involved. "That doesn't mean we suspect drugs or foul play " said Boston Police Sgt. Margot Hill. "We always take a thorough look at the cause of death when it occurs under unknown circumstances." She said it takes three to four weeks to determine the results of toxicology tests.Boston police also have issued citations to the house for liquor and housing code violations. The fraternity was suspended from conducting social activities pending the results of an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident."We want to find out what happened " Senior Associate Dean Robert M. Randolph told reporters at a news conference Sunday. "If hazing was involved  we want to find that out."

He did anthropological field work in Nicaragua  Honduras  El Salvador  Mexico and Colombia and was a consultant for Oxfam Amer-ica  the International Council of Voluntary Agencies  the Inter-American Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union.Professor Diskin's curiosity about Caribbean cultures was sparked by a fascination with the Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York City in his youth  and bloomed a few years later when he worked as a seaman on a Norwegian ship."When I discovered in college that I could have a career and make a living studying culture as a systematic phenomenon  traveling  observing human variety and writing about it  it was a revelation " Professor Diskin told an interviewer in 1992.He joined the MIT faculty in 1967 as an assistant professor in the Department of Humanities after receiving his PhD in anthropology from the University of California in Los Angeles  where he also earned the BA (1960) and MA (1963).At MIT  he helped create the Latin American Studies Program and served on the committee on minority recruitment and hiring in the humanities.

Herbert Beckwith  94  key figure in modern architecture in U.S.,Herbert L. Beckwith  94  an MIT professor and architect who was a key figure in modern architecture in the United States  died June 3 at his home in Kingston  MA."Herbert Beckwith was a key figure in the introduction of modern architecture to the United States  and to MIT in particular. His buildings were strikingly innovative at the time; they don't seem so unusual now because  in fact  they did so much to define the subsequent architectural mainstream " said Professor William J. Mitchell  the dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning.Mr. Beckwith helped design 11 buildings at MIT  as well as buildings at Rutgers University; Fisk University in Nashville  Tenn.; the University of Rochester; and the University of Virginia.He also designed the US Embassy in Taiwan  the American Insurance Underwriters Building in Tokyo  and various buildings in Rangoon  Manila and Bermuda.Born in Midland  Mich. on Feb. 4  1903  he came to MIT from the Case School of Applied Science as a student in 1923. He received his SB in architecture in 1926  and taught at MIT from then until his retirement in 1968  except for a 2-1/2 year leave of absence during World War II. He received his Masters degree in architecture in 1927. In addition to teaching  he served the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in many capacities.In 1934  he became an assistant professor and in 1937 co-founded the firm of Anderson & Beckwith with fellow faculty member Lawrence B. Anderson. Beckwith became associate professor in 1939 and professor in 1947.Robert Bell Rettig  in his "Guide to Cambridge Architecture: Ten Walking Tours " wrote:"Anderson & Beckwith's Alumni Swimming Pool introduced the International Style to MIT [in 1938-39]. Among the building's noteworthy features are its off-center  corner-windowed entrance  its sharp-edged cubistic masses  and its south facing window wall opening on an enclosed garden."Discussing Rockwell Cage  built in 1947  Rettig wrote: "Anderson & Beckwith were the pioneers of modern architecture at MIT. Glass-walled  clear span Rockwell Cage is attached to their Briggs Field House of 1939.... through unassuming athletic facilities such as these  new stylistic currents infiltrated the Institute's classical bastions."The 11 buildings he helped design at MIT include the war-time Radiation Lab  the Van de Graaf Generator building of 1948  demolished recently  and the Dorrance Food Laboratory of 1950  the first building at MIT to exceed five stories in height and the first at MIT to use the glass curtain-wall construction.In 1953 and 1954  Mr. Beckwith served as an associate of architect Eero Saarinen in the development of the Kresge Auditorium and the MIT Chapel.Anderson Beckwith & Haible designed McCormick Hall  1962-67  the first women's dormitory at MIT. The firm also designed the Whittaker Life Sciences Building  1963  and the Pierce Boathouse of 1965.Other buildings in the Boston area include the Science Building at UMass Boston  the Brookline Town Office Building and Raytheon's Executive Office Building in Lexington.Mr. Beckwith  during World War II  was executive officer of the Princeton University Station of the National Defense Research Committee.He married Elizabeth McMillin in 1945 and returned to MIT in 1946 as Director of Exhibitions. He became Professor of Architecture the following year  and served as Acting Head of the Department of Architecture in 1956-57.

Professor Emeritus Kaplan dead at 84,Professor Emeritus Irving Kaplan of Belmont  84  a founding member of the Department of Nuclear Engineering at MIT  died at Massachusetts General Hospital on April 10 following heart surgery.Professor Kaplan  who came to MIT as a visiting professor in 1957 and be-came a permanent member of the faculty a year later when the Department of Nuclear Engineering was created  retired in 1978 but continued to teach as a senior lecturer until 1989.A native New Yorker  Professor Kaplan received the BA from Columbia University in 1933  the MA in 1934 and the PhD in chemistry in 1937.He worked on the Manhattan Project as a physicist in the Division of War Research at his alma mater from 1941-46  doing research on isotope separation. In 1943  he worked on nuclear reactor design at the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory. Before the war  Professor Kaplan worked as a research chemist at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1937-41.After World War II  he was a founding member of the Federation of American Scientists and joined other prominent scientists in a campaign to place atomic energy under civilian control in the US. This group of scientists was instrumental in creating the Atomic Energy Commission as an alternative to military control in 1947.Professor Kaplan was a senior physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island from 1946-57  during which time he wrote the textbook Nuclear Physics and championed the cause of female employees  among other issues. When the laboratory was built  the only women's room was in a secure area which none of the women had the security clearance to enter. At Professor Kaplan's urging  a facility was erected outside the secure area. It was called "The Irving Kaplan Memorial Hall."Professor Kaplan came to Cambridge as a visiting lecturer at Harvard in 1956 and moved to MIT a year later. At that time  courses in nuclear engineering were offered by the Department of Chemical Engineering. From 1959-69  he co-directed an AEC-sponsored research program at the MIT reactor on lattices of partially enriched uranium rods in heavy water. He also developed graduate and undergraduate courses in humanities programs such as the history of science and classical Greek."There is now  and there always has been  a need to broaden the learning of scientists and engineers " said Professor Kaplan. "But I wish I could say that humanists  especially the literary people  were as interested in learning something about technology as the scientists and engineers are in learning something of the humanities."He was a member of the American Physical Society and a fellow of the American Nuclear Society. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He received the Marvin Fox Memorial Medal in 1966 and the Arthur Holly Compton Award in 1972 from the American Nuclear Society for his contribution to the teaching of nuclear physics. He served as secretary of the MIT faculty from 1975-77.A modest man  Professor Kaplan responded this way to a 1967 departmental request to list his accomplishments: "I've learned to play a fairly good game of squash since coming to MIT. I am looking forward to being appointed (upon my retirement) to a Professorship of Theoretical and Applied Squashology."Professor Kaplan is survived by his wife  Ruth Evelyn (Stern); two sons  Paul of Lexington and Dan of Santa Cruz  CA; a daughter  Judith of Seattle  and four grandchildren. His sons received MBAs from the Sloan School of Management.A memorial service will be scheduled.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon May 7  1997.

Whitehead remembers Tsongas's courage and commitment,Former US Senator Paul E. Tsongas was remembered fondly by his friends at the Whitehead Institute  where he was chairman of the board of directors from 1993 until his death January 18 at age 55.Mr. Tsongas had been a member of the Whitehead board since 1987. After undergoing a bone-marrow transplant for cancer  he was chairman of the state Board of Regents of Higher Education when he resigned to campaign for the Democratic nomination for president in 1991. He also served on the boards of other not-for-profit institutions  including Yale University  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the International Institute for Energy Conservation."Paul Tsongas cared deeply about the Whitehead Institute and our work " said Dr. Gerald R. Fink  Whitehead's director. "He had a powerful grasp of the complex issues facing biomedical science today and appreciated the importance of educating tomorrow's leaders in science. His exemplary career in public service is an inspiration to all of us as we seek to apply our own skills to improve human health and welfare. I am honored to have known him. The Whitehead Institute is extremely saddened by this loss. We are indebted to Senator Tsongas for his guidance and commitment to the Whitehead Institute.""Paul was a great leader and a good friend " said Susan Whitehead  vice chair of the Whitehead board and daughter of Edwin C. "Jack" Whitehead  founder of the Whitehead Institute. "He brought to the Institute the same commitment and vision that exemplified his career in public service. Earlier this fall  Paul insisted on hosting the dedication of our new research wing despite his failing health. He carried out his role as host with a lot of fortitude and good humor and inspired all those who were present. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."Many remember how Mr. Tsongas touched their lives personally. Manju Chaudhuri  library assistant at Whitehead  recalled a Friday in October 1995 when she was rushed to get home before her son returned from school. She missed a step and fell down the stairs  suffering a concussion."Senator Tsongas  who happened to be at the bottom of the stairs  heard me fall  rushed back up the stairs and knelt by me  holding my hand as I lay trembling on the floor " she said. "He called through the building for a doctor and an ambulance and then simply stayed with me  holding my hand until the ambulance arrived. He asked me my name  and my husband's name  and when I told him I was worried about my son arriving home from school to an empty house  he asked John Pratt  associate director of Whitehead  to send someone to my home to meet my son and bring him to the hospital."Later that day  he called the public affairs office from his home and asked after me; he told them that he was very anxious to know how I was doing  and that they should keep him informed of my condition through the weekend " Ms. Chaudhuri said. "He touched my heart  and although I never met him again  I feel as though I have lost a close friend. I never had the opportunity to tell him how much his actions that day meant to me  but somewhere  I'm sure he knows."Fran Lewitter  Whitehead's senior biocomputing scientist  echoed Ms. Chaudhuri's sentiments. She became involved with the Tsongas family while attending graduate school at the University of Colorado at Boulder  where she met Tsongas's cousin  Theodora Tsongas. When Dr. Lewitter moved to Boston during Mr. Tsongas's 1977 Senate bid  she became involved with the campaign at Theodora's urging.At the 1994 groundbreaking event for the Whitehead's new wing  Dr. Lewitter introduced herself to Mr. Tsongas and told him she had volunteered for his campaign. "There were many ways he could have responded  but he thanked me for my help with great sincerity " she said. "The campaign had happened nearly 20 years earlier  and he could easily have commented on any aspect of the campaign in general. But he was genuinely grateful for my contribution and told me so. I found it very moving."A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon January 29  1997.

Albert Hill  developer of radar and air defenses  dies at 86,Professor Emeritus Albert G. Hill  86  a key leader in the development of World War II radar  director of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory development of the electronic Distant Early Warning and SAGE continental air defense systems  and first chairman of The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory  died October 21 at his home in Needham of pulmonary disease.Dr. Hill  director of Lincoln Lab from 1952-1955  waged "an evangelical campaign to gain acceptance of the idea of early warning as a defense against Soviet bomber attack " wrote James R. Killian Jr.  the late president of MIT  in his 1985 autobiography  The Education of a College President. Professor Hill won approval when he appeared before the National Security Council "at a meeting presided over by President Truman  to advocate the building of a Distant Early Warning line" of radar  a $2 billion project  Dr. Killian said. Professors Hill and Killian also advocated the DEW line in an article they wrote for the November 1953 Atlantic Monthly entitled "For a Continental Defense " citing "the new and awful urgency created by the Soviets' achievement of a nuclear explosion."Dr. Paul E. Gray  chairman of the MIT Corporation  paid tribute to Dr. Hill  who served MIT for 41 years as a technical leader in the MIT Radiation Lab (which developed radar into a useful military tool)  a professor of physics  director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (1949-52)  director of Lincoln Lab  deputy chairman of the Physics Department from 1967-73  MIT vice president for research (1970-75)  and director of the Plasma Fusion Center (1976-78)  as well as the leader in the 1970s of the transformation of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory into the independent Draper Laboratory. Dr. Hill also was chairman of an advisory group that started MIT's Energy Laboratory.Dr. Gray recalled Dr. Hill's distinguished career as an MIT administrator  which included being "a strong but generally unrecognized early advocate for equal opportunity and affirmative action." Dr. Hill personally recruited African-American graduate students and faculty for the physics department  putting it in the vanguard of these efforts at MIT. Additionally  he chaired the committee which proposed and organized the Office of Minority Education. Dr. Gray also recalled that "Al often described himself as being like a roasted marshmallow-hard and crusty on the outside but soft and gooey on the inside.""For many years  Al Hill quietly contributed to the national security by his advice to the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the Weapons Systems Advisory Group and the Institute of Defense Analysis were being formed" in the Cold War era of the late 1950s  said Robert A. Duffy  retired president and CEO of Draper Lab  where Hill served as chairman from 1970 through 1982.Dr. Hill was born in St. Louis on Jan. 11  1910. He received the BS in mechanical engineering (1930) from Washington University in St. Louis and  after serving two years with Bell Telephone Laboratories  the MS in physics (1934). He received the PhD in physics from the University of Rochester in 1937.He was an instructor in physics at MIT from 1937 to 1941  when he became a staff member of the Radiation Laboratory at MIT  known as the "RadLab " which was developing radar for use in World War II. Hill headed the Radio Frequency Group in the Transmitter Components division and at the end of the war was chief of the 800-person division. The head of the RadLab  Lee DuBridge  summarized the laboratory's achievement "by remarking that radar won the war; the atom bomb ended it " Dr. Killian wrote.After the war  Dr. Hill became an associate professor of physics. In July 1946  MIT formed the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) as the natural continuation of the Radiation Laboratory's basic research division. Dr. Hill was named associate director  and became professor of physics in 1947. In 1949  Dr. Killian appointed Hill as the director of RLE.Lincoln Lab was formed in 1951 at the request of the government  and Dr. Hill became its second director  leading the development of the computerized SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) air defense system and the DEW line of radar sets stretching from northern Alaska to Greenland. He helped establish in 1955 the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters  Allied Powers Europe) Technical Center in The Hague and the NATO Communications Line  extending from northern Norway to eastern Turkey.In 1956  Dr. Hill was called to Washington to serve as director for the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group and vice president and director of research for the Institute for Defense Analyses. He returned to MIT in 1959 and resumed teaching physics. In 1965  he also became a lecturer in the Department of Political Science.In 1970  he was appointed to the new position of vice president for research  supervising research administration on campus and the special laboratories (Lincoln Lab and the Instrumentation Lab). In May 1970  MIT formally divested itself of the Instrumentation Lab  which under the direction of Charles Stark Draper had developed the gyroscope and the inertial guidance system and had guided Apollo XI to the moon in July 1969. Dr. Hill  still vice president of research  became the chairman of the independent board of directors of the laboratory  renamed the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in honor of its founder. Draper Lab remained a division of MIT for three years and became independent in 1973."My association with the laboratory came at a politically disquieting time " Dr. Hill said in an interview in the Draper Lab newsletter  D-Notes  upon his retirement in 1982. "The public resistance to the Vietnam War affected MIT  and Stark Draper's laboratory knew that it was going to be separated from MIT. The morale was low." In the end  however  only eight out of 2 000 people chose not to stay at the lab. In 1984  the Draper Laboratory dedicated the Albert G. Hill Building at One Hampshire Street in Cambridge.Hill received many honors  including the Presidential Certificate of Merit in 1948  the Air Force Distinguished Civilian Service Medal in 1955  the Secretary of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Medal in 1959  and the Washington University Distinguished Alumni Citation in 1955.A memorial service is planned at MIT at a time to be announced. Hill had no children. His first marriage  to Ethel Sampson  ended in divorce. He and his second wife  Ruth Parker  were married in 1960; she died in 1990. Hill is survived by three nieces and a nephew: Carol Hill Timson of St. Louis and Salem  MO; Lexie Hill Schoen  The Hague  Holland; Marcella Louise Hill Taylor  Apple Valley  CA; and Jesse Landis Boogher Hill  Aptos  CA  and by Lexie Timson Long of St. Louis and nine other grandnieces and grandnephews.

He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Rochester in 1937.He was an instructor in physics at MIT from 1937 to 1941  when he became a staff member of the Radiation Laboratory at MIT  known as the "Radlab " which was developing radar for use in World War II. Hill headed the Radio Frequency Group in the Transmitter Components division  and at the end of the war headed the 800-person division. The Radlab had three major missions: "to develop a 10-centimeter airborne set for use by night fighters; to achieve an accurate precision gun-laying radar  and to design a long-range navigational system which came to be called LORAN and that today is in worldwide use " Killian wrote in 1985. Killian wrote that the head of the Radlab  Lee DuBridge  summarized the laboratory's achievement "by remarking that radar won the war; the atom bomb ended it."After the war  Hill became an associate professor of physics. In July 1946  MIT formed the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) as the natural continuation of the Radiation Laboratory's basic research division. Hill was named associate director  and became professor of physics in 1947. In 1949  Killian appointed Hill as the director of RLE and Professor Jerome B. Wiesner (a member of the Radlab who was to become president of MIT in 1971) as associate director.The MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington  Mass. was formed in 1951 at the request of the government  and Dr. Hill became its second director  serving from 1952 to 1955 and leading the development of the computerized SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) air defense system and the Distant Early Warning line of radar sets stretching from northern Alaska to Greenland. Among those who worked on the SAGE project at Lincoln Lab was Kenneth Olsen  who built on his experience with SAGE in founding Digital Equipment Corporation.Hill returned to teaching and research at MIT in 1955 and during that summer helped to establish the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters  Allied Powers Europe) Technical Center in The Hague and the NATO Communications Line  extending from northern Norway to eastern Turkey.In 1956  Dr. Hill was called to Washington to serve as director for the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group and vice president and director of research for the Institute for Defense Analyses. He returned to MIT in 1959 and resumed teaching physics. In 1965  he also became a lecturer in MIT's Department of Political Science.In 1970  he was appointed to the new position of vice president for research  combining the duties formerly held by the vice president for research administration on campus and the vice president for special laboratories (Lincoln Laboratory and the Instrumentation Laboratory). In May 1970  MIT formally divested itself of the Instrumentation Laboratory  which under the direction of Charles Stark Draper had developed the gyroscope and the inertial guidance system and had guided Apollo XI and mankind to the moon in July 1969. Hill  still vice president of research at MIT  became the chairman of the independent board of directors of the laboratory  renamed The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in honor of its founder. The Draper Lab remained a division of MIT for three years and became totally independent in 1973."My association with the laboratory came at a politically disquieting time " Hill said in an interview in the Draper Lab newsletter  D-Notes  upon his retirement in 1982. "The public resistance to the Vietnam War affected MIT and Stark Draper's laboratory knew that it was going to be separated from MIT. The morale was low." Hill met weekly with the top 50 people at the lab "and by the time of the tenth meeting  suspicions were somewhat allayed and Draper personnel believed there would be a future for them..."The spirit of the lab members was excellent. I am proud of my part in preserving Draper Laboratory  but more importantly  I am proud of what the lab people did."In the end  only eight out of 2 000 people chose not to stay at the lab.  In 1984  the Draper Laboratory dedicated a new building at One Hampshire Strreet  Cambridge and named it the Albert G. Hill Building.Asked what he felt was his greatest contribution  Hill responded  "My greatest contribution to society has been in thinking people are good and dignified  and that people left to their own devices with a little bit of guidance will do a good job."Hill remained MIT vice president of research and was chairman of an advisory group that started MIT's Energy Laboratory. He retired as vice president in 1975  only to come back in 1976 and serve until 1978 as director of MIT's Plasma Fusion Center.Hill received many honors  including the Presidential Certificate of Merit in 1948  the Air Force Distinguished Civilian Service Medal in 1955  the Secretary of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Medal in 1959  and the Washington University Distinguished Alumni Citation in 1955.A memorial service is planned at MIT at a time to be announced. Hill had no children. His first marriage  to Ethel Sampson  ended in divorce. He and his second wife  Ruth Parker  were married in 1960; she died in 1990. Hill is survived by three nieces and a nephew: Ms. Carol Hill Timson of St. Louis and Salem  Mo.; Ms. Lexie Hill Schoen  The Hague  Holland; Ms. Marcella Louise Hill Taylor  Apple Valley  Cal.; and Jesse Landis Boogher Hill  Aptos  Cal.  and by Lexie Timson Long of St. Louis and nine other grandnieces and grandnephews.

Gordon S. Brown  pioneer electrical engineer and educator  is dead at 88,Institute Professor Emeritus Gordon S. Brown  a pioneer in electrical engineering  computers and engineering education  died Friday  Aug. 23 at his retirement home in Tucson  AZ. Dr. Brown  a former resident of Concord  MA  and Grantham  NH  would have been 89 on August 30.His family said he died of complications resulting from cancer.Dr. Brown was recognized internationally for his pioneering work in automatic feedback-control systems  computer technology and the numerical control of machine tools. During World War II  Dr. Brown and his colleagues developed automatic fire control and aiming systems for guns used by the US military on land  at sea and in the air.He was also known for his leadership in the modernization of engineering education as dean of the School of Engineering from 1959 to 1968."Gordon Brown influenced the directions of engineering education in the past 50 years more than any other single person " said Professor Paul Penfield  head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. "Gordon's engineering science approach  stressing fundamental science  today forms the guiding principle behind most if not all engineering education  in all disciplines  at MIT and elsewhere."Dr. Jay W. Forrester  Germeshausen Professor of Management Emeritus at MIT  and the inventor of core memory for computers as well as the field of system dynamics  served as a research assistant in Dr. Brown's laboratory. "He's been my mentor since 1940  the major influence on my career " Dr. Forrester said.In remarks he made in 1990 on the 50th anniversary of MIT's Servo-mechanisms Laboratory  which Dr. Brown founded  Dr. Forrester said that Dr. Brown "always kept a close tie between theory  research and the real world. He continuously had the end result in mind."Gordon was always looking for ways to change and improve the human condition " Dr. Forrester added. "He frequently made the observation that `the only steady state is the steady state of change.'"Dr. Brown did not lay aside his dedication to achieving change when he retired from MIT. In the 1980s-working with Professor Forrester and using system dynamics thinking and the feedback structure of all systems  whether physical  social or natural-he introduced a new basis and foundation for K-12 education in his local school system in Tucson.In the Catalina Foothills school district where he lived in retirement  Dr. Brown  as described by Professor Forrester in his 1990 remarks  began creating "a revolution in education." He started in 1988 by loaning software to an eighth-grade teacher of biology in the Orange Grove Junior High School to demonstrate how feedback concepts could enter the classroom.Dr. Brown then negotiated with Apple Computer for a gift of $100 000 worth of computers for the same teacher's classroom. He arranged a meeting with the Waters Foundation of Framingham  MA  which has been funding the project since 1989.Dr. Brown was born in 1907 in Australia and  at the age of 18  graduated from what was then known as Workingman's College  now the Royal Melbourne Technical College  with three diplomas-in mechanical  electrical and civil engineering.He entered MIT as a junior in 1929 on the strength of his college credits and received the SB in electrical engineering in 1931. As a graduate student  he served as a research assistant and instructor in electrical engineering  receiving the SM in 1934 and ScD in 1938.He was appointed an assistant professor in 1939  associate professor in 1941 and full professor in 1946. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1939.Cinema integraphDr. Brown's doctoral thesis focused on what was called the cinema integraph (because it employed motion picture film)  a precursor of the analog computer. Having early on recognized the future for computers and automation  he founded the Servomechanisms Laboratory in 1940  where work was done that led to the development in the late 1940s of the first major digital computer  Whirlwind  which was used after World War II by Lincoln Laboratory to develop the SAGE system of air defense for North America.The development of concepts of automatic control for machines and industrial processes resulted in numerical control and the Automatically Programmed Tool Language (APT)  which revolutionized modern machine work worldwide and has had a profound and lasting effect on industry. The term numerical control was coined in the laboratory to describe the direct control of the motions of a physical device  such as a machine tool  by numerically coded signals in the form now common in digital computers.Dr. Brown  as head of the Department of Electrical Engineering in 1952  launched a major program to restructure and revise the entire electrical engineering curriculum. He did this by basing the teaching more firmly than ever before on fundamental sciences such as physics and mathematics and bringing about basic change in the department's educational approaches and philosophy.Later  when he became dean of the School of Engineering in 1959  Dr. Brown extended to other engineering departments the same principles of curriculum revision. To this task  however  he brought added zeal on behalf of the principle of interdepartmental  interdisciplinary research as contained in the idea of the "research center." The concept grew and  once again  technical and engineering schools worldwide reconfigured themselves in similar directions using the MIT experience as a model.Dr. Brown continued as dean of engineering until 1968  when he became the first holder of the Dugald Caleb Jackson Professorship.  In 1973  Dr. Brown was appointed Institute Professor. He retired in 1974.In 1985  Building 39  housing the Microsystems Technology Laboratories  was named the Gordon Stanley Brown Building.Dr. Brown was the author of more than 50 technical and professional papers and the co-author  with the late Donald P. Campbell  of Principles of Servomechanisms  published in 1948 and still a standard reference in the field.He was a frequent consultant to industry and government. His honors included several honorary degrees  a President's Certificate of Merit  the George Westinghouse Award and the Lamme Medal of the American Society for Engineering Education  the Medal in Electrical Engineering Education from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers  the Joseph Marie Jacquard Annual Memorial Award from the Numerical Control Society  the Rufus Oldenburger Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  and the Robert Fletcher Award of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College.He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  a life member of the American Society for Engineering Education and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an Eminent Member of Eta Kappa Nu.Dr. Brown and his wife  Jean (Alfred) Brown of Tucson  would have observed their 61st wedding anniversary on the day of his death. Besides his wife  he leaves a daughter  Sydney B. DeVore of Tucson  a son  Stanley A. Brown of Gaithersburg  MD (a 1965 MIT graduate)  and two grandchildren  Samuel C. DeVore and Laurel I. DeVore.Two memorial services are planned  one at a Catalina Foothills school in Tucson and one at MIT. The dates will be announced. Dr. Brown's body will be cremated.Donations may be made to the Gordon Stanley Brown Fund  administered by the System Dynamics Society  to promote system dynamics teaching in schools and to pay K-12 teachers during the summer to write up the work they have done using the system dynamics approach. Contributions should be addressed to Alexander Pugh  treasurer  System Dynamics Society  49 Bedford Rd.  Lincoln  MA 01773.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon August 28  1996.

Forrester  Germeshausen Professor of Management Emeritus at MIT  and the inventor of core memory for computers as well as the field of system dynamics  served as a research assistant in Dr. Brown's laboratory. "He's been my mentor since 1940  the major influence on my career " Dr. Forrester said today.In remarks he made in 1990 on the 50th anniversary of MIT's Servomechanisms Laboratory  which Dr. Brown founded  Dr. Forrester said that Dr. Brown "always kept a close tie between theory  research and the real world. He continuously had the end result in mind.""Gordon was always looking for ways to change and improve the human condition " Dr. Forrester added. "He was forever ready to do battle with self-appointed guardians of the past. He frequently made the observation that `the only steady state is the steady state of change.'"Dr. Brown did not lay aside his dedication to achieving change when he retired from MIT. In the 1980s --working with Professor Forrester and using system dynamics thinking and the feedback structure of all systems  whether physical  social or natural--he introduced a new basis and foundation for K-12 education in his local school system in Tucson  Ariz.The field of system dynamics  which grew out of feedback concepts pioneered in Dr. Brown's Servomechanisms Laboratory  deals with the feedback dynamics of social and natural as well as physical systems.In the Catalina Foothills school district where he lived in retirement  Dr. Brown  as described by Professor Forrester in his 1990 remarks  began creating "a revolution in education." He started by loaning software to an eighth-grade teacher of biology in the Orange Grove Junior High School to demonstrate how feedback concepts could enter the classroom."The ideas took hold " Dr. Forrester said. "The classroom was transformed." Dr. Brown then negotiated with Apple Computer for a gift of $100 000 worth of computers for the same teacher's classroom. He then brought in the principal of the junior high and finally the superintendent of the school system  the school board and parents  to witness the results of the new approach.Soon the systems approach spread to other subjects and schools in the district  Dr. Forrester said  becoming a "common foundation that can underlie physical science  social studies  biology  environmental; issues  history and a student's own personal life experiences."Dr. Forrester said Dr. Brown told him he had been having "more fun in this local school effort than ever before in his career. His vitality  pioneering  dedication to change and concern for others had survived nearly two decades past retirement."A Catalina Foothills science teacher  Frank Draper  said Dr. Brown brought to the school system in 1988 "his wealth of knowledge  experience and an amazing ability to open doors." A year later  "he had secured a critical meeting with Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow and had arranged a meeting with the Waters Foundation" of Framingham  Mass. Both organizations made major commitments to the school district. "Without the foresight  leadership and spirit of Dr. Brown  none of this would have been possible " Mr. Draper said today.Dr. Brown was born in 1907 in Australia and  at the age of 18  graduated from what was then known as Workingman's College  now the Royal Melbourne Technical College  with three diplomas--in mechanical  electrical and civil engineering.He entered MIT as a junior in 1929 on the strength of his college credits and received the SB degree in electrical engineering in 1931. As a graduate student  he served as a research assistant and instructor in electrical engineering  receiving the SM degree in 1934 and ScD in 1938. He was appointed an assistant professor in 1939  associate professor in 1941 and full professor in 1946. He had become a naturalized American citizen in 1939.Dr. Brown's doctoral thesis was on what was called the cinema integraph (because it employed motion picture film)  a precursor of the analog computer. Having early recognized the future for computers and automation  he founded the Servomechanisms Laboratory in 1940  where work was done that led to the development in the late 1940s of the first major digital computer  Whirlwind.After the World War II  the Whirlwind computer became part of MIT's Lincoln Laboratory and Lincoln's all-important development of the SAGE system of air defense for the North American continent.The development of concepts of automatic control for machines and industrial processes resulted in numerical control and the Automatically Programmed Tool Language (APT)  which revolutionized modern machine work worldwide and has had a profound and lasting effect on industry. The term numerical control was coined in the laboratory to describe the direct control of the motions of a physical device  such as a machine tool  by numerically-coded signals in the form now common in digital computers.Dr. Brown  as head of the Department of Electrical Engineering in the early 1952  launched a major program to restructure and revise the entire electrical engineering curriculum. He did this by basing the teaching more firmly than ever before in fundamental sciences such as physics and mathematics and bringing about basic change in the department's educational approaches and philosophy. These changes soon were to be taken as models to be followed at leading electrical engineering schools throughout the nation and abroad.Later  when he became dean of MIT's School of Engineering in 1959  Dr. Brown extended to other engineering departments the same principles of curriculum revision. To this task  however  he brought added zeal on behalf of the principle of interdepartmental  interdisciplinary research as contained in the idea of the "research center."The concept grew and  once again  technical and engineering schools worldwide reconfigured themselves in similar directions using the MIT experience as a model.Still another dimension of Dr. Brown's tenure as dean of engineering was his push for international cooperation and the transfer of technology to other societies. He led MIT's participation in international educational relationships by establishing MIT interactions with institutions in India and Singapore and with the Technical University of Berlin.Dr. Brown continued as dean of engineering until 1968 when he became the first holder of the Dugald Caleb Jackson Professorship  named for the man who was head of the MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering when Dr. Brown arrived as an undergraduate. In 1973  Dr. Brown was further honored by his appointment as Institute Professor  a rank MIT reserves for its most distinguished faculty members.In announcing Dr. Brown's selection  then President Jerome B. Wiesner said  "Over a period of more than four decades  Dr. Brown has made numerous significant contributions that have shaped the development both of his profession and MIT. The power of his ideas and his achievements born of his relentless energy and innovative nature have had important impact on industry and on institutions of higher learning in this country and elsewhere in the world."Dr. Brown  who had served as chairman of the MIT faculty in 1951 and 1952  retired in 1974 with the titles Institute Professor  Emeritus  and Professor of Electrical Engineering  Emeritus. In 1985  an MIT building housing the Microsystems Technology Laboratories was named the Gordon Stanley Brown Building.Dr. Brown was the author of more than 50 technical and professional papers and the co-author  with the late Donald P. Campbell  of Principles of Servomechanisms  published in 1948 and still a standard reference in the field.Dr. Brown was a frequent consultant to industry and government. His honors included several honorary degrees  a President's Certificate of Merit  the George Westinghouse Award and the Lamme Medal of the American Society for Engineering Education  the Medal in Electrical Engineering Education from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers  the Joseph Marie Jacquard Annual Memorial Award from the Numerical Control Society  the Rufus Oldenburger Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  and the Robert Fletcher Award of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering  a life member of the American Society for Engineering Education and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an Eminent Member of Eta Kappa Nu.Dr. Brown and his wife  Jean (Alfred) Brown of Tucson  would have observed their 61st wedding anniversary on the day of his death. Besides his wife  he leaves a daughter  Ms. Sydney B. DeVore of Tucson  a son  Stanley A. Brown of Gaithersburg  Md.  a 1965 MIT graduate  and two grandchildren  Samuel C. DeVore and Laurel I. DeVore.Two memorial services are planned  one at a Catalina Foothills school in Tucson and one at MIT. The dates will be announced. Dr. Brown's body will be cremated.Donations can be made to the Gordon Stanley Brown Fund  administered by the System Dynamics Society  to promote system dynamics teaching in schools and to pay K-12 teachers during the summer to write up the work they have done using the system dynamics approach. Contributions should be addressed to Alexander Pugh  treasurer  System Dynamics Society  49 Bedford Rd.  Lincoln  Mass. 01773.

Retired MIT Prof. Joseph Bicknell  Wind Tunnel Pioneer  Dies at 84,Joseph Bicknell  a retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of aeronautics who was instrumental in developing MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel  and in aircraft testing in the tunnel during World War II  died in Kingman  Ariz.  Monday (July 22)   at the age of 84. The cause of death was a stroke  according to his daughter  Marsha Bicknell  of Kingman.Professor Bicknell  an MIT graduate  was a member of MIT's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics for 30 years  specializing in applied aerodynamics.He was born in Weymouth to a family that traced its roots in the community to 1632. He received the SB degree in aeronautics from MIT in 1934 and the SM in 1937. It was a time when few engineers went on to PhDs. He became an assistant in aeronautical engineering from 1934 to 1937  when he joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics doing flight research. He returned to MIT in 1939 as a research associate and was appointed to the faculty in 1943. He became an associate professor in 1946 and professor in 1969.He served as executive officer of the department and faculty operations officer for several years. In 1968-69 he headed the department's Experimental Projects Laboratory.He also taught one summer in Europe as part of an exchange program  at universities in Berlin and London.In the four years prior to his retirement in 1973  he was on leave of absence from MIT while teaching at Texas A&M.He and his late wife  Mary F. (Hart) Bicknell  lived in Hingham while Professor Bicknell was at MIT. They spent most of their retirement years on the island of Port Aransas  Tex.  off Corpus Christie  where Professor Bicknell continued his lifelong interest in sailing boats  both as a sailor and builder.He had been a member of the MIT Sailing Club for many years and his hobby was small boat design  construction and repair  which took up much of his time in Texas  his daughter said. He limited himself to boats 22-feet and smaller  such as the Marblehead Skiff  one of his favorites  she said. Over the years  he wrote numerous articles for small boat journals and was considered an expert in the field.He and his wife also became active members of the small island community   his daughter said.Professor Bicknell was chairman of the harbor committee  played a key role in developing the community's first library  served as proofreader for the island newspaper and was a substitute teacher in the public schools.Teaching remained one of her father's greatest enjoyments  his daughter said  and he accepted calls to teach in any grade  from elementary to high school. "He really shaped up one third grade that was having problems with multiplication " she said.In addition to his daughter  Marsha  Professor Bicknell leaves two sons  Frank L. of Sydney  Nova Scotia  and Kenneth H. of Kingman.Professor Bicknell had lived in Kingman about six years. There were no funeral services. His body will be cremated and  according to his wishes  a sailing friend will spread the ashes on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

He was 101. The cause of death was pneumonia and congestive heart failure.The body was cremated. A memorial service is being planned for the fall.Professor Taylor  known to all as Fay  is survived by his wife  Alice (Hickley) Taylor  98  also of Weston; a son by a previous marriage  Philip A. Taylor of San Carlos  CA.; seven grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. Another son  Charles Fayette Taylor Jr.  died three years ago in Pompano Beach  FL.Charles Fayette Taylor was born Sept. 24  1894  in New York City.  In his autobiography Growing Up with the Twentieth Century  written in the early 1970s around childhood drawings carefully preserved by his mother  he writes  "These drawings. show a near obsession with machinery and constitute an eyewitness account of many aspects of technical practice. in the early years of the century." Reading at age 14 about the Wright brothers' flights of 1904 and 1905 kindled his intense interest in airplanes.Professor Taylor earned the bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Yale in 1915. During World War I  he first served as an inspector of aircraft material for the US Signal Corps and headed the Navy's Aeronautical Engine Laboratory in Washington  DC. He obtained the degree of Mechanical Engineer from Yale in 1920 and was subsequently in charge of the US Army's Air Service Laboratory in Dayton  OH  where he supervised engine endurance tests  aircraft flight tests and fuel anti-knock tests. It was there that he met Orville Wright. From 1923 to 1926 he was in charge of airplane engine design and development at the Wright Aeronautical Corp. He was involved in developing the air-cooled "Whirlwind" engine used on the historic flights of Charles Lindbergh and Robert Byrd.In 1926  Professor Taylor began his long association with MIT as an associate professor of aeronautical engineering. By 1929 he had been promoted to professor and became head of aeronautical engineering  a position he held until 1933  when he became professor of mechanical engineering and director of the new Sloan Laboratory for Aircraft and Automotive Engines  a position he held until his retirement in 1960.Through his research and teaching in the 1930s  '40s and '50s  he developed the scientific framework for engine design and operation still in use today  and established MIT as an internationally renowned center in this field. He  his colleagues and his students made major contributions to critical areas of engine performance: combustion  detonation  fuels  thermodynamic analysis  friction  heat transfer  air capacity and dimensionless scaling. His two-volume seminal text  The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice  remains a primary reference for automotive engineers.In addition to his engineering and teaching contributions  Professor Taylor was an accomplished artist. Following his retirement from MIT  he embarked on a second career as a sculptor in metal and a painter in watercolors and oils. He also  worked in architecture and played the piano and harpsichord in chamber groups. In 1988  Professor and Mrs. Taylor were honored for creating the Educational Counseling Committee of Boston in the late 1940s and helping more than 2 000 black students attend college.Almost two years ago  as he prepared to mark the centennial of his birthday  Professor Taylor was interviewed for an article in MIT Tech Talk (September 14  1994). Asked about reaching 100  Professor Taylor remarked  "I don't recommend it." But then he added  with a smile  "I saw Haley's Comet twice (1910 and 1986)."The family requested that expressions of sympathy take the form of contributions to one's favorite charity.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon July 24  1996.
Fall memorial planned for Professor T.S. Kuhn,An MIT memorial service will be held in the fall for Professor Emeritus Thomas S. Kuhn  who died June 17 at his home in Cambridge at the age of 73. He had been ill for the last two years with cancer of the bronchial tubes and throat.Professor Kuhn was an internationally known historian and philosopher who made seminal contributions to understanding how scientific views are supported and discounted over time. The author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)  an enormously influential work on the nature of scientific change  he was widely celebrated as the central figure in contemporary thought about how the scientific process evolves.In MIT's Commencement address in June  Vice President Albert Gore spoke of the relationship "between science and technology on the one hand and humankind and society on the other" and referred to "the great historian of science  Thomas Kuhn."Before Professor Kuhn's work  scientific evolution was commonly understood as the patient and progressive accumulation of knowledge about the world. In Structure of Scientific Revolutions  Professor Kuhn rejected this understanding in favor of an historical and social conception  based on a distinction between normal and revolutionary science. Normal science-the dominant enterprise-is puzzle-solving: scientists solve problems within settled frameworks of inquiry that are not themselves tested but simply taken for granted. They model their solutions on scientific paradigms-the exemplary solutions to once-outstanding puzzles that scientists master as part of their training (for example  Newton's derivation of planetary orbits from his laws of motion).In revolutionary periods (for example  the overthrow of Newtonian by relativist mechanics)  Professor Kuhn said  unsolved puzzles or anomalies accumulate  and some scientists propose alternative frameworks of inquiry  often profoundly discontinuous with earlier views. Revolutions succeed when a new  incommensurably different outlook is better able to handle the previously unsolved anomalies and win the allegiance of younger scientists. In Kuhn's vision  then  science is not a smooth evolution of human knowledge  but an historical process in which periods of relative calm are punctuated by dramatic breaks in understanding.From 1982 to 1991  when he retired  Dr. Kuhn was the first Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor in Philosophy at MIT.Jed Z. Buchwald  the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science and director of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology  said Professor Kuhn "was the most influential historian and philosopher of science of our time. He instructed and inspired his students and colleagues at Harvard  Berkeley  Princeton and MIT  as well as the tens of thousands of scholars and students in his own and other fields of social science and the humanities who read his works."Professor Kuhn joined MIT in 1979 from Princeton University  where he had been the M. Taylor Pyne Professor of the History of Science and a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. At MIT  his work centered on cognitive and linguistic processes that bear on the philosophy of science  including the influence of language on the development of science.Born in Cincinnati in 1922  Professor Kuhn studied physics at Harvard  where he received the SB (1943)  AM (1946) and PhD (1949). He taught at Harvard and at the University of California at Berkeley before joining Princeton in 1964. From 1978 to 1979 he was a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities.His honors included the Howard T. Behrman Award for distinguished achievements in the humanities (1977)  the History of Science Society's George Sarton Medal (1982) and the Society for Social Studies of Science's John Desmond Bernal Award (1983). He became a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 1990 and was given honorary degrees by several universities throughout the world.He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the Philosophy of Science Association (president  1988-90)  and the History of Science Society (president  1968-70).Professor Kuhn is survived by his wife  Jehane R. Kuhn; two daughters  Sarah Kuhn of Framingham and Elizabeth Kuhn of Los Angles; a son  Nathaniel S. Kuhn of Arlington;  a brother  Roger S. Kuhn of Bethesda; and four grandchildren  Emma Kuhn LaChance  Samuel Kuhn LaChance  Gabrielle Gui-Ying Kuhn and Benjamin Simon Kuhn. He previously was married to Kathryn Muhs of Princeton  NJ  who is the mother of his children.Contributions in his memory may be made to Hospice of Cambridge and mailed to 245 Winter St.  Waltham  02154.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon July 24  1996.

Prof. Thomas S. Kuhn of MIT  Noted Historian of Science  Dead at 73,CAMBRIDGE  Mass.--Professor Emeritus Thomas S. Kuhn of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  the internationally known historian and philosopher who made seminal contributions to understanding how scientific views are supported and discounted over time  died Monday  June 17  at his home in Cambridge. He had been ill for the last two years with cancer of the bronchial tubes and throat. He was 73.Professor Kuhn  author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)  an enormously influential work on the nature of scientific change  was widely celebrated as the central figure in contemporary thought about how the scientific process evolves.Earlier this month  for example  Vice President Albert Gore  delivering the June 7 commencement address at MIT  spoke of the relationship "between science and technology on the one hand and humankind and society on the other " and referred to "the great historian of science  Thomas Kuhn."Mr. Gore said Professor Kuhn "described the way in which our understanding of the world properly evolves when faced with a sudden increase in the amount of information. More precisely  he showed how well-established theories collapse under the weight of new facts and observations which cannot be explained  and then accumulate to the point where the once useful theory is clearly obsolete. As new facts continue to accumulate  a new threshold is reached at which a new pattern is suddenly perceptible and a new theory explaining this pattern emerges. It is an important process  not only at the societal level  but for each of us as individuals as we try to make sense of the growing mountain of information placed at our disposal."More than one million copies of Professor Kuhn's famous 1962 book have been printed. It exists in more than a dozen languages and continues to be a basic text in the study of the history of science and technology.From 1982 to 1991  when he became an emeritus professor  Dr. Kuhn held the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professorship in Philosophy. He was the chair's first holder.Jed Z. Buchwald  the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science and director of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology  said Professor Kuhn "was the most influential historian and philosopher of science or our time. He instructed and inspired his students and colleagues at Harvard  Berkeley  Princeton and MIT  as well as the tens of thousands of scholars and students in his own and other fields of social science and the humanities who read his works."Professor Kuhn joined MIT in 1979 from Princeton University where he had been the M. Taylor Pyne Professor of the History of Science and a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. At MIT  his work has centered on cognitive and linguistic processes that bear on the philosophy of science  including the influence of language on the development of science.Born in Cincinnati in 1922  Professor Kuhn studied physics at Harvard University  where he received the SB (1943)  AM (1946) and PhD (1949). His shift from an interest in solid state physics to the history of science  was traceable to a "single 'Eureka!' moment in 1947 " according to a 1991 Scientific American article. Professor Kuhn  the article says  "was working toward his doctorate in physics at Harvard University when he was asked to teach some science to undergraduate humanities majors. Searching for a simple case history that could illuminate the roots of Newtonian mechanics  Kuhn opened Aristotle's Physics and was astonished at how 'wrong' it was. How could someone so brilliant on other topics be so misguided in physics? Kuhn was pondering this mystery  staring out of the window of his dormitory room . . .when suddenly Aristotle 'made sense.' Kuhn realized that Aristotle's views of such basic concepts as motion and matter were totally unlike Newton's. Aristotle used the word 'motion ' for example  to refer not just to change in position but to change in general. . . . Understood on its own terms  Aristole's physics 'wasn't just bad Newton ' Kuhn says; it was just different."Professor Kuhn taught at Harvard and at the University of California  Berkeley  before joining Princeton in 1964. From 1978 to 1979 he was a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities.His honors included the Howard T. Behrman Award for distinguished achievements in the humanities (1977)  the History of Science Society's George Sarton Medal (1982) and the Society for Social Studies of Science's John Desmond Bernal Award (1983). He became a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 1990 and was given honorary degrees by several universities throughout the world.He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the Philosophy of Science Association (president  1988-90)  and the History of Science Society (president  1968-70). Professor Kuhn is survived by his wife  Jehane (Barton) Kuhn; two daughters  Sarah Kuhn-La Chance of Framingham  Mass.  and Elizabeth Kuhn of Los Angles  and a son  Nathaniel Kuhn of Arlington  Mass.The service is private. A memorial service will be held at MIT in the fall.Contributions in his memory may be made to Hospice of Cambridge  186 Alewife Brook Parkway  Cambridge  Mass. 02138
James Culliton  VP for administration  dies at 58,James J. Culliton  who held major responsibilities in personnel  finance and administration at MIT for more than 20 years  died Monday  June 3  at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long battle with a rare affliction  multiple myeloma. He was 58 and was a resident of Cambridge and of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.Since 1994  Mr. Culliton had been vice president for administration  an assignment which gave him responsibility for a wide variety of academic  fiscal and student services. For the decade before that  he was vice president for financial operations. In both positions  he demonstrated sound leadership and wisdom during a critical time in the life of the university when world changes  largely driven by the end of the Cold War  created a new financial climate for universities as the federal government's research needs and goals shifted. He was highly regarded for his expertise in sponsored research funding and for his skill in communicating the value to the nation of maintaining the long-standing university-government partnership in research.Commenting on his effectiveness at MIT and on the national scene  MIT President Charles M. Vest said  "Jim's calm  steady approach to resolving complicated issues between the research universities and the federal government was highly respected by the university community and federal officials alike. His voice in the Academic Council  the highest policy-making body in the Institute  was similarly one of reason and wisdom. He brought great humanity to the management of MIT: not only did he foster the careers of the many people who reported to him over the years  he cared about each of them. I know that I am just one of many at MIT-staff  faculty and students-who will deeply miss Jim's ready smile  his ability to find humor in any situation  and his good words for each person who came his way."Paul E. Gray  chairman of the MIT Corporation and former president of the Institute  said  "Jim Culliton was my friend and close colleague for more than 25 years. To each of the varied responsibilities he held at MIT  he brought high energy  excellent judgment  unquestionable integrity  and an extraordinary sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of all he touched. MIT has become a more diverse  more humane place because of Jim's efforts here."Mr. Culliton's unique background allowed him to combine financial and management expertise with the hands-on perspective of a naval aviator who flew jet aircraft off the decks of carriers earlier in his career.As vice president for administration  Mr. Culliton had responsibility for the Office of Sponsored Programs  the Admissions Office  the Office of Student Financial Aid  Career Services and Preprofessional Advising  the Bursar's Office  the Registrar's Office  the Medical Department and the Athletics Department. The last was a fitting assignment  because he was no stranger to the playing fields of MIT. Rugby was his prime sport and he played on the MIT rugby club team for many years  in addition to serving as the club's adviser.Mr. Culliton joined MIT in 1970 as assistant to the vice president in the Office of the President. From 1973 to 1978 he also was director of personnel services and in 1978 he took on additional duties as director of personnel. In 1984 he was selected to be the vice president for financial operations and assumed overall responsibility for all aspects of internal financial management and the budget of MIT  the negotiation with the government of indirect cost reimbursement  investment and benefits accounting  registration and student financial services  and the development of financial reporting systems.By virtue of his several administrative capacities at the Institute  he was a member of the Academic Council  the Faculty Council and the MIT Research Committee. He was also a trustee of the MIT Retirement Plan  and he served as MIT's representative on the board of directors of the Controlled Risk Insurance Company  Ltd  and the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR)  an organization of universities focused on issues of research funding. He was chairman of COGR from 1992 to 1994.Mr. Culliton received the BS degree in engineering from the US Naval Academy in 1959  served as an aviator in the US Navy from 1959 to 1964  and received the MS degree from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1966.Before joining MIT  he was a management consultant with the Birla Group of Industries in Bombay  India  from 1966-68  and was a project specialist in management with the Ford Foundation from 1968-70  working with the Administrative Staff College of India.Mr. Culliton was born June 11  1937  in Trenton  NJ. He is survived by his parents  Agnes and Thomas Culliton  Jr. of Hudson  FL  his brother Thomas  of Louisville  KY  two sons  Christopher and Mark  and a daughter  Mary  all of Cambridge.The funeral service will be private.

The cause of death was cancer of the pancreas.A prominent logician and philosopher  Professor Boolos was internationally known as one of the originators of provability logic. He was a leading authority on the work of the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege  widely regarded as the founder of modern logic. Professor Boolos's work contributed to an important and ongoing reevaluation of the significance of Frege's philosophical and technical achievements  especially his attempt to show that the basic laws of arithmetic are themselves principles of logic."George Boolos was regarded as one of the greatest philosophical logicians of his generation " said Professor Philip S. Khoury  dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science and a professor of history.

He was the author of The Logic of Provability and  with Richard C. Jeffrey  Computability and Logic  one of the most widely used textbooks in intermediate logic. He was also an expert on puzzles of all kinds  ranging from crossword puzzles to Rubik's Cube.

Joseph Bicknell  emeritus professor in aero/astro  dies at 84,Retired MIT professor Joseph Bicknell  who was instrumental in developing the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel and in performing aircraft testing in the tunnel during World War II  died in Kingman  AZ  on July 22 at the age of 84. The cause of death was a stroke  according to his daughter  Marsha Bicknell of Kingman.Professor Bicknell  professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics  was a member of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics for 30 years  specializing in applied aerodynamics.He was born in Weymouth to a family that traced its roots in the community to 1632  12 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims. He received the SB and SM degrees in aeronautics from MIT in 1934 and 1937. It was a time when few engineers went on to PhDs. He was an assistant in aeronautical engineering from 1934 to 1937  when he joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics doing flight research. He returned to MIT in 1939 as a research associate and was appointed to the faculty in 1943. He became an associate professor in 1946 and professor in 1969.He served as executive officer of the department and faculty operations officer for several years. In 1968-69 he headed the department's Experimental Projects Laboratory. He also taught one summer in Europe as part of an exchange program  at universities in Berlin and London.In the four years prior to his retirement in 1973  he was on a leave of absence from MIT while teaching at Texas A&M.Professor Bicknell and his late wife  Mary F. (Hart) Bicknell  lived in Hingham while Professor Bicknell was at MIT. They spent most of their retirement years on the island of Port Aransas  TX  off Corpus Christi  where he continued his lifelong interest in sailing boats  both as a sailor and builder.He had been a member of the MIT Sailing Club for many years and his hobby was small-boat design  construction and repair  which took up much of his time in Texas  his daughter said. He limited himself to boats 22 feet and smaller  such as the Marblehead Skiff  one of his favorites  she said. Over the years  he wrote numerous articles for small-boat journals and was considered an expert in the field.He and his wife also became active members of the small island community  his daughter said.Professor Bicknell was chairman of the island's harbor committee  played a key role in developing the community's first library  served as proofreader for the island newspaper and was a substitute teacher in the public schools.Teaching remained one of Professor Bicknell's greatest enjoyments  his daughter said  and he accepted calls to teach in any grade  from elementary to high school. "He really shaped up one third grade that was having problems with multiplication " she said.In addition to his daughter Marsha  Professor Bicknell leaves two sons  Frank L. of Sydney  Nova Scotia  and Kenneth H. of Kingman.Professor Bicknell had lived in Kingman about six years. There was no funeral service. His body was cremated and  according to his wishes  a sailing friend spread the ashes on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon April 28  1996.
Professor P.A. Smith dies at 81,Prescott A. Smith  professor emeritus of mechanical engineering  died Friday  April 19  at Emerson Hospital in Concord following a stroke. He was 81 and resided in Concord.A memorial service will be held today (Wednesday  April 24) at 3pm in the First Parish Church  Concord.Professor Smith  who was born in Somerville  received the SB degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1935. He spent the next 10 years in the manufacturing industry  returning to MIT in 1945 as an assistant professor and director of the Machine Tool Laboratory  now the Materials Processing Center. He was promoted to full professor in 1969 and retired in 1975.Professor Smith followed in the footsteps of his father  the late Professor Robert H. Smith  who was appointed to the mechanical engineering faculty in 1882 and retired in 1932. Thus  father and son served MIT for a total of 80 years.The elder Professor Smith founded and directed the Machine Tool Laboratory. His son refurbished the laboratory and brought it up to date  partly by obtaining machinery that the government no longer needed following the end of World War II.Professor Smith had played a special role during the war as chief plant engineer at the Hemphill Co. in Pawtucket  RI  a manufacturer of the knitting machines for men's hosiery. At the Army's request  he converted production to the manufacture of gunsights for the M1 rifle  the Army's principal weapon  earning the factory a government award at the end of the war.Professor Smith's research activities were in the areas of manufacturing  productivity  metal cutting and materials processing. He authored a number of papers for professional journals  contributed to several books and was a consultant to industry.When he was elected chairman of the of the Boston chapter of the American Society of Tool Engineers in 1951  a reporter asked him for a definition of "tool engineer." He replied  "The prime function of tool engineering is to take a design engineer's blueprints and determine how and with what to produce the product that has been designed."He was a Life Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Society of Tool and Manufacturing Engineers.Professor Smith and his wife  Eloise M. Smith  lived on the MIT campus for seven years starting in 1966  when Professor Smith served as faculty resident in Bexley Hall.They retired to Chatham on Cape Cod but returned to Concord in 1990.Professor Smith leaves his wife; a daughter  Priscilla A.

Professor emeritus David Durand dies at 83,Dr. David Durand  a professor emeritus of management who was an early adherent of applying statistical methods-especially sampling-to problems in corporate finance and other fields  died February 26 at the MIT Infirmary. Dr. Durand  who lived in Lexington  was 83.His family said the cause of death was aplastic anemia.Raised in Ithaca  NY  Dr. Durand received the BA degree from Cornell University in 1934  and both a master's degree (1938) and PhD (1941) from Columbia University. He was a lieutenant in the US Naval Reserve during World War II  serving in the Hawaiian Islands and on Guam.Before coming to MIT in 1953  he was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research  then in Riverdale  NY  and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. He also did consulting work for the Twentieth Century Fund and taught part-time at Columbia.It was at the National Bureau of Economic Research  said MIT economist Dr. Paul A. Samuelson  an Institute professor and Nobel laureate  that Dr. Durand "pioneered the empirical study of how long-term bonds usually require a higher yield than short. Everyone understands that today  but he was the first to document it."Dr. Durand's first appointment at MIT was as a research associate at the Sloan School of Management. He became an associate professor in 1955 and professor in 1958. He retired in 1973.In addition to the application of statistical methods to financial problems  his fields of specialization included term structure of interest rates and statistics.His research in finance included a sampling analysis of default experience for consumer installment loans  farm mortgage lending experience and factors affecting bank stock prices.His work with statistical methodology and techniques involved the early use of punch-card equipment for general statistical tabulation as well as for mathematical computation.He was the author of a textbook  Stable Chaos  as well as many articles for professional journals. He was an associate editor of Financial Management for a number of years.Some of Dr. Durand's strongly held views stirred lively debate with other members of the management faculty.One of his former doctoral students  Don Lewin of Lewin Associates of York  PA  a consulting firm  said that Dr. Durand "used his keen intellect and statistical knowledge and skills to develop many ideas" and to question whether statistical models matched reality. "Frequently  this did not endear him to those enamored of a model. Indeed  his doubting approach caused him to be often in the center of a controversy."In one such case involving the cost of capital  Dr. Durand wrote that two Sloan colleagues who disagreed with him "have cut out for themselves the extremely difficult  if not impossible  task of being pure and practical at the same time. Starting with a perfect market in a perfect world  they have taken a few steps in the direction of realism; but they have not made significant progress."Dr. Durand also insisted  Dr. Lewin said  that the model builder rely heavily on his or her own judgment. In Stable Chaos  Dr. Durand wrote  "Systematic procedures and objective tests serve to strengthen the analyst's judgment  not to replace it; they enable him to learn more quickly and more effectively from his own experience  and to sharpen his critical faculties."Dr. Durand also championed good writing and enlivened some of his own journal articles with intriguing figures of speech. In one  he wrote: "To suppose that any imaginative analyst or responsible financial manager  interested in a comprehensive view  would be content to base an important appraisal and the subsequent investment decision on just one of the many useful numbers available is on a par with supposing that a hungry gourmet at a smorgasbord would be content to make a whole meal of pickled herring."Another former student  Dr. Paul D. Berger  professor and department chair in Quantitative Methods and Marketing at the Boston University School of Management  recalled Dr. Durand as "a special teacher and mentor to many students.

While in Massachusetts  he lived in Brookline and Boston.Professor Ambrose was recognized for his research in differentialgeometry  partial differential equations and probability theory. He alsowas known for his commitment to political and social causes particularly in Argentina and Chile in South America when thosecountries were ruled by military regimes.He came to international attention in the summer of 1966 while avisiting teacher at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina  when hewas severely beaten along with other faculty members and students bymilitary police. This occurred shortly after a military regime  whichhad taken over the government in a bloodless coup  had ordered agovernment takeover of public universities.On returning to Boston  he denied the Argentine government's contentionthat he and other professors had prompted the incident by violatingvarious governmental decrees.

That was partly due to a great sense of humor accompanied by a hearty laugh. She also had an incredibly positive can-do attitude even though she had a very complicated and demanding job and persistent health problems. It is hard to imagine our office  professionally or personally  without her."Ms. Eramo  who lived in Watertown  formerly resided in Pittsfield.She is survived by her father  Edgar Eramo of Pittsfield and a brother  Michael Eramo  and a sister-in-law  Helen Carey  of Concord.A funeral mass was held on January 6 at Sacred Heart Church in Pittsfield.

Professor Robley D. Evans  nuclear medicine pioneer  dies,Dr. Robley D. Evans  professor emeritus of physics  winner of the 1990 Enrico Fermi Award and a pioneer in studying the effects of radium on the human body  died of respiratory failure on December 31 in Paradise Valley  AZ  where he lived in retirement. He was 88.Professor Evans was a founder of the field of nuclear medicine and established the standard  used throughout the world  for the maximum permissible body burden of radium.In its citation accompanying the Fermi Award  the Department of Energy said that Professor Evans did pioneering work "in measurements of body burdens of radioactivity and their effects on human health  and in the use of radioactive isotopes for medical purposes." The Fermi Award is the highest scientific award given by the DOE.The DOE added that Professor Evans  as a founder of nuclear medicine  "occupies a special place in the history of radiation physics and biology and the development of our understanding of radiation effects today. He has had a unique impact on radiation biology."As a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology under Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan in the late 1920s  Professor Evans measured background radiation coming from the earth  so that it could be distinguished from cosmic radiation.With this experience  his attention was drawn to the victims of radium poisoning  a national scandal in the 1920s. The painters of luminous watch dials in factories often used their lips to point their brushes and thus ingested radium. Radium had also been used indiscriminately in tonics and other medical applications in the belief that it was close to a cure-all and it had been handled carelessly by people in industry. Once in the body  it usually became concentrated in the bones  continuing to emit potentially dangerous radiation and often causing cancer or creating a skeletal condition that resulted in spontaneous fractures.Professor Evans began his studies of the biological effects of radiation while he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at Berkeley. After joining the MIT faculty in 1934  he established the Radioactivity Center and developed the meter arc method of measuring the amount of radium in the body as indicated by gamma radiation-a method still considered the most reliable and often referred to as the "Evans method."This research led Professor Evans in 1941 to establish one ten-millionth of a gram of radium as the "maximum permissible body burden"-the greatest quantity of a radioactive substance that the human body can tolerate without a likelihood of damage  allowing a large margin for safety.Establishing such a standard was crucial as the United States embarked on its atomic bomb program  in which large numbers of researchers and workers would be encountering radioactive materials. The standard is still used today.The Radioactivity Center also produced the first iodine isotope for a number of medical purposes. With Dr. James Howard Means of Harvard Medical School  Professor Evans began to explore the use of radioactive iodine for the diagnosis and treatment of goiter.Since iodine taken orally rapidly moves to the thyroid glands  "radioactive cocktails" containing an iodine isotope enabled physicians to study the metabolism of the glands by measuring the radioactivity with a Geiger-Muller counter. Radioactive iodine also proved effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.Professor Evans's accomplishments in medical physics included development of a technique to preserve human whole blood  research primarily undertaken for the benefit of wounded servicemen in World War II. By using as many as two radioactive forms of iron and one of iodine-a so-called "triple tracer" experiment-doctors could determine how well transfused blood cells remained in a recipient's blood stream. A chemical was found to preserve the blood for up to three weeks  the time it required to reach distant battlefields and subsequently was used in blood banks for several decades.Professor Evans' book  The Atomic Nucleus  was a basic text for graduate students in nuclear physics. First published in 1955  the book has been reprinted and revised and is still frequently cited.In 1938  Professor Evans was responsible for MIT's first "atom-smasher " the first cyclotron in the world for biological and medical use. The cyclotron was also used in fundamental nuclear and industrial research and remained in service for some three decades.The Radioactivity Center was involved with fundamental nuclear physics as well as medical applications. Examples of the work that was done include studies on the properties of nuclei; the development of instrumentation and methods for measuring radionuclides; standardization of radionuclides; development of radiochemical methods for isolating radionuclides  and development of methods of calculating radiation dose.Professor Evans was born on May 18  1907  in University Place  NE. At the California Institute of Technology  he received the BS degree in physics in 1928  the MS in 1929 and the PhD in 1932. He was an active member of the faculty for 38 years  retiring in 1972  after which he continued to visit MIT as a consultant and served as a special project associate at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN.A former colleague  Dr. Constantine J. Maletskos of Gloucester  MA  described Professor Evans as "a world-class physicist with an. uncanny ability to see through a problem  to simplify it and get at the important roots  and to set up an appropriate model for a seemingly simple solution to a complex analysis. His famous admonition in one of his radon papers  `A little contemplation saves a lot of calculation ' expresses it all."Professor Evans also was regarded as a superb teacher  and many of the leading nuclear physicists today were among his 1 200 graduate students  100 of whom completed their theses under his direction. He wrote a practical manual on teaching  "You and Your Students " which proved so useful to professors that it has been translated into several languages. More than 100 000 copies have been distributed throughout the world.Among his many honors  Professor Evans was the recipient of the Theobald Smith Medal and Award in the Medical Sciences from the American Association for the Advancement of Science  the Presidential Certificate of Merit  the Hull Award and Gold Medal from the American Medical Association  The Silvanus Thompson Medal from the British Institute of Radiology  the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Health Physics Society and the William D. Coolidge Award from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine.He was a member of many societies and professional organizations  and served as president of both the Radiation Research Society and the Health Physics Society. Among his memberships were the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Life Fellow)  the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Fellow)  the American Association of Physicists in Medicine  the American Association of Physics Teachers  the American Industrial Hygiene Association  the American Nuclear Society  the American Roentgen Ray Society and the Royal Scientific and Literary Society of Sweden.Survivors include his wife  Mary Margaret (Shanahan) of Paradise Valley  AZ  and three children from his first marriage  Richard O. Evans of West Palm Beach  FL  Ronald A. Evans of Tuscon  AZ and Mrs. Gene (Nadia) Hill of Corpus Christi  TX.
Prof. Robley D. Evans of MIT Dies at 88,Dr. Robley D. Evans  professor emeritus of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  winner of the 1990 Enrico Fermi Award and a pioneer in studying the effects of radium on the human body  died December 31 in Paradise Valley  AZ  where he lived in retirement. He was 88.His family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.There were no services.Professor Evans was a founder of nuclear medicine and established the standard  used throughout the world  for the maximum permissible body burden of radium.The Department of Energy said in its citation accompanying the Fermi Award  that Professor Evans did pioneering work "in measurements of body burdens of radioactivity and their affects on human health  and in the use of radioactive isotopes for medical purposes."The Fermi Award is the highest scientific award given by the DOE. It recognizes "exceptional and altogether outstanding scientific and technical achievement in the development  use or control of atomic energy. The award honors the memory of Enrico Fermi  the leader of the scientists who achieved the first self-sustained  controlled nuclear reaction.The DOE added that Professor Evans  as a founder of nuclear medicine  "occupies a special place in the history of radiation physics and biology and the development of our understanding of radiation effects today. He has had a unique impact on radiation biology."It was at the California Institute of Technology  as a graduate student in the late 1920s and early 1930s  that Professor Evans's task for his doctoral thesis (under Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan) was to measure background radiation coming from the earth  so that it could be distinguished from cosmic radiation.With this experience  he gave special attention to the victims of radium poisoning  a national scandal in the twenties. The painters of luminous watch dials in factories had made a practice of pointing their brushes with their lips and thus ingested radium. Radium had also been used indiscriminately in tonics and other medical application in the belief that it was close to a cure-all and it had been handled carelessly by people in industry. Once in the body  it usually became concentrated in the bones  continuing to emit potentially dangerous radiation and often causing cancer or creating a skeletal condition that resulted in spontaneous fractures.Professor Evans began his studies of the biological effects while a National Research Fellow at the University of California at Berkeley. After joining the MIT faculty  he established the Radioactivity Center and developed the meter arc method of measuring the amount of radium in the body as indicated by gamma radiation--a method still considered the most reliable and often referred to as the "Evans method."The center no longer exists  but through the years it studied more than 900 individuals  in some cases arranging for the exhumation of bodies to determine the amount of radium present. One subject  a woman who had received a massive quantity of radium in a medicine over a long period of time  lived to be 93 years old and willed her body to the center so that a final examination could be made.Professor Evans had estimated that by the year 2000 more than a hundred persons who have ingested significant amounts of radium will still be living. At his suggestion  the Atomic Energy Commission established a Center for Human Radiobiology  located at Argonne National Laboratory  to ensure long-range observation of such cases. The center functioned until recently and has now been discontinued.The research Professor Evans did at MIT enabled him in 1941 to establish one ten-millionth of a gram of radium as the "maximum permissible body burden" -- the greatest quantity of a radioactive substance that the human body can tolerate without a likelihood of damage  allowing a large margin for safety.Creation of such a standard was crucial because the United States was about to embark on its atomic bomb program  in which large numbers of researchers and workers would be encountering radioactive materials in unprecedented ways. The standard is still internationally used today and is applied to various radioactive substances including plutonium-239 and strontium-90.The Radioactivity Center also produced the first iodine isotope for a number of medical purposes  using neutrons from discarded radium and radon needles from Boston hospitals.Professors Evans had undertaken this line of research  which contributed to the beneficial use of radioactivity  with Dr. James Howard Means of Harvard Medical School. In 1937 they began to explore the use of radioactive iodine for the diagnosis and treatment of goiter.Since iodine taken orally rapidly moves to the thyroid glands  "radioactive cocktails" containing an iodine isotope enabled physicians to study the metabolism of the glands by measuring the radioactivity with a Geiger-Muller counter. Radioactive iodine  in appropriately higher dosages  also proved effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.Professor Evans's accomplishments in medical physics included development of a technique to preserve human whole blood  research primarily undertaken for the benefit of wounded servicemen in World War II.His breadth and interest in medical physics was demonstrated by his personal participation in such diverse studies ranging from histochemistry of human skin to carcinogenesis in humans.Professor Evans was invited to the faculty at MIT in 1934 to establish the world's first academic course in nuclear physics.For more than two decades his book  "The Atomic Nucleus " was a basic text for graduate students in nuclear physics. Published in 1955  the book has been reprinted and revised and  even today  is still frequently cited.In 1938  Professor Evans was responsible for building the Markle Cyclotron  MIT's first "atom-smasher" and the first cyclotron in the world for biological and medical use.The machine was completed in 1939 and its first product was iodine-130  a 12-hour isotope which was much more useful than iodine-128 with which the medical experiments started and which had a half life of only 25 minutes--barely enough time for adequate observation. The cyclotron was also used in fundamental nuclear and industrial research and remained in service for some three decades.During World War II  the cyclotron produced isotopes for three dozen research centers in the Boston area. Working with scientists and physicians from MIT and the Harvard Medical School  Dr. Evans attacked the problem of preserving whole blood.By using as many as two radioactive forms of iron and one of iodine--a so-called "triple tracer" experiment--doctors could determine how well transfused blood cells remained in a recipient's blood stream. A chemical was found to preserve the blood for up to three weeks  the time it required to reach distant battlefields and subsequently was used in blood banks for several decades.Professor Evans also was responsible during the war for analyzing uranium from the Belgian Congo destined for use in atomic bombs  an agreement having been made that radium recovered in processing would be returned to Belgian authorities. His responsibility was to make an accurate analysis of the uranium content of uranium-bearing ore samples. In a laboratory set up in his home in Belmont  MA  and with his wife as assistant  he quietly conducted the tests without benefit of guards and unknown to neighbors.The Radioactivity Center was involved with fundamental nuclear physics as well as medical applications. Examples of the work that was done include studies on the properties of nuclei; the development of instrumentation and methods for measuring radionuclides; standardization of radionuclides (for determining the absolute amount); development of radiochemical methods for isolating radionuclides; and development of methods of calculating radiation dose.Professor Evans was born on May 18  1907  in University Place  NE. At the California Institute of Technology  he received the BS in physics in 1928  MS in 1929 and PhD in 1932. After two years as a National Research Council Fellow at the University of California  Berkeley  he went to MIT  where he remained an active member of the faculty for 38 years  retiring in 1972. Following his retirement  he continued to visit MIT as a consultant and served as a special project associate at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  MN.A former colleague  Dr. Constantine J. Maletskos of Gloucester  MA  described Professor Evans as "a world-class physicist with an... uncanny ability to see through a problem  to simplify it and get at the important roots  and to set up an appropriate model for a seemingly simple solution to a complex analysis.

More than 100 000 copies have been distributed throughout the world.In addition to his book  Professor Evans wrote more than 200 scientific papers and chapters in books. He served as editor  associate editor or member of the editorial board for a number of journals.He served as a consultant or committee member for many hospitals  institutions  government agencies and scientific societies.From 1946 to 1969 he was chairman of the National Research Council Subcommittee on Shipment of Radioactive Materials  which established regulations that have been internationally adopted.Among his many honors  Professor Evans was the recipient of the Theobald Smith Medal and Award in the Medical Sciences from the American Association for the Advancement of Science  the Presidential Certificate of Merit  the Hull Award and Gold Medal from the American Medical Association  The Silvanus Thompson Medal from the British Institute of Radiology  the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Health Physics Society and the William D.

Professor Julian Szekely dies at 61,Dr. Julian Szekely  a professor of materials engineering who was widely known as an expert in the development of mathematical models in materials processing operations  including analysis of the economic  technological and environmental factors involved in the production of various materials  died of cancer December 7 at the MIT Infirmary. He was 61.The breadth of his research could be seen in his seven textbooks  12 edited volumes  more than 420 journal articles  and several patents  with several more patents pending.A member of his department  Dr. Kenneth C. Russell  professor of metallurgy and nuclear engineering  said that Dr. Szekely's colleagues and students "knew him for a unique sense of humor and a love of life to match his passion for work."A memorial service will be held at the MIT Chapel on February 16 at 5pm.As an example of his pioneering work in mathematical modeling  he developed the first comprehensive mathematical model of fluid-flow  electromagnetics and heat transfer phenomena for the refinement and solidification of metals  as well as the first quantitative analysis of plasma torches and innovative approaches to circuit board attachment problems.As long as 15 or 20 years ago  as a consultant to steel companies  Professor Szekely provided analysis of the status and prospects of the overall steel-making technologies of that era. This came at a time when the industry required more optimal and efficient steps for steel production in its struggle against the impact of obsolescence  high costs of labor and pollution control.Last August  in Mattsee  Austria  Dr. Szekely co-organized a "Top Executive Steel Summit" that explored future directions in steel production and promoted a dialogue between equipment builders and steelmakers from throughout the world.His work has covered a broad range of problems  including gas-solid reactions  fluid flow and mixing in steel processing  fluid flow phenomena in blast furnaces  welding  plasma processing and the electromagnetic processing of materials. Many leading researchers in these fields on the international scene are former students of his.His recent research concentrated on the mathematical modeling of welding  soldering  mold filling operations  plasma systems  chemical vapor deposition and electron beam melting reactors  among others.Recent research accomplishments included the mathematical modeling of a complex microgravity experiment that was flown in the space shuttle last year  as part of a multi-team effort among NASA and various American and German universities. This is a continuing experiment that is scheduled to be flown again in 1997.His interests extended into areas outside his professional field. In a 1989 letter to The Boston Globe  for example  he offered several reasons for the poor performance of US high school students in comparison with students from many other countries. He said it was one of the reasons why too few Americans were choosing careers in science or science education.He added that "the considerable sums spent on supporting the vast and rapidly growing administrative bureaucracies could be much better spent in supporting properly planned classroom activities."Professor Szekely was born on November 23  1934  in Budapest  Hungary. He became a US citizen in 1972.He received both the BSc (1959) and PhD (1961) degrees in chemical engineering from Imperial College in London.He taught at Imperial College until coming to the United States in 1966. He taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo until 1975  when he came to MIT as a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.Over the years  Professor Szekely was a frequent visitor to Japan and  in 1990  to prepare for a five-month sabbatical at Osaka University  he took a Japanese language course at MIT. He went on to hone his skills and  when he was invited to address the Japanese Engineering Academy in 1992  he did so in an hour-long speech in Japanese and even took questions after his talk in Japanese.Professor Szekely believed that US-Japanese relations could be greatly improved if engineers and scientists in each country learned more about the other country's language  culture and society.His recommendations included the establishment of joint appointments at leading universities  where professors would spend one to two months a year lecturing  preferably using the mother tongue of the students.Dr. Szekely had an extensive consulting practice  and he worked with companies and government organizations in the US  Japan  Latin America  Germany  Finland  Sweden and France. He was an effective mentor of minority students and an active participant in MIT's Japan Program.Professor Szekely's memberships included the National Academy of Engineering  the American Institute of Mining  Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers  the Institution of Chemical Engineers (British)  the Metals Society (British) and the Japanese Iron and Steel Institute.In addition  his work was recognized by numerous awards  both nationally and internationally.These included the Charles H.

Unexpected bequest to benefit students,For 36 years  Donald Keith North worked at MIT with the Speech Communication Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics.He was hired in 1959 as a technician by Professor Kenneth N. Stevens  who still heads the group  and over the years worked himself up to project technician  assisting the students in the group in countless ways."He was really a great help to the students in their projects " said Dr. Stevens  Clarence Joseph LeBel Professor of Electrical Engineering. And he devoted long hours to it  often spending part of his weekends in the lab  Professor Stevens said.Originally from Florida  Mr. North lived by himself in Cambridge most of his life. "I think it's fair to say that MIT was his real home " Professor Stevens said  adding that in his spare time  Mr. North did some photography and was somewhat of a train buff.His devotion to MIT was formally recognized in 1989 when he won a Murphy Award  given for dedication to the Institute  especially in regard to students.In recent years  his health was not good  largely because of diabetes  but he continued to work although he had cut back to half time.Mr. North died last February at the age of 67. "We had a memorial service " Professor Stevens said. "Some of his past students said they remembered being a little afraid of him because of his high standards  but they said it with a smile and with affection."Mr. North's will demonstrated his affection for the Institute.He left MIT the bulk of his estate  which is expected to be close to $165 000.When the money becomes available in a few years  interest from it will be directed where all agree Mr. North would want it to be-to the students he worked with so much of his life.According to Professor Stevens  the money will be used for such purposes as supporting student projects  including work done through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program  and in sending students to conferences to present papers.-----------------------------------------------------------OBITUARIESHorace DunbarHorace Dunbar  91  a longtime resident of Ipswich  died July 1 in Hartford  CT  after a long illness.

John F. Collins  former mayor and MIT professor  dies at 76,Former Boston Mayor John F. Collins  who held visiting and consulting professorships at MIT for 13 years after he left office  died November 23 of pneumonia at the age of 76.Mayor Collins  widely regarded as one of the most successful and progressive mayors in the city's history  was appointed a visiting professor on January 2  1968  the day after he completed his second term in office.In announcing the appointment  MIT President Howard W. Johnson said the appointment represented an important step in developing a broadened program of study and research in urban affairs at MIT.Mr. Collins said that population shifts and an imbalance of resources "make necessary a national effort unprecedented in domestic America to save our cities."Every segment of our nation must join in this endeavor "he said  including both the public and private sectors  universities  business and labor. "MIT with its vast reservoir of expertise and resources can be a focal point in this endeavor."As visiting professor  Mr. Collins was affiliated with urban studies (then in the Department of Political Science)  the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management and the Department of Civil Engineering.At the time  a number of departments and laboratories  including what was then the Department of City and Regional Planning  were becoming more active in dealing with such city problems as transportation  pollution  housing  health  crime  budget management and taxes.Mr. Collins' most conspicuous accomplishment as mayor was a massive urban redevelopment program  paralleling a rejuvenation in business and city government.Later in his tenure at MIT  Mr. Collins concentrated his efforts in the Sloan School  where he had the title of consulting professor. While there  he coordinated a much-discussed study  based on a computer simulation model of the state's criminal justice system  which concluded that increasing the capacity of prisons was the key to reducing crime in the state.Mr. Collins retired from MIT in 1981.------------------------------------------Schmitt memorialA gathering to remember Institute Professor Emeritus Francis O.

Institute Professor Francis O. Schmitt dies at 91,Institute Professor Emeritus Francis O. Schmitt  internationally recognized as a pioneer in modern biological research and in the study of the brain  died Tuesday  Oct. 3  at his home in Weston. He was 91.In 1941  Dr. Schmitt accepted a call from MIT President Karl Taylor Compton to head the Institute's effort to develop a world center of molecular biology. After time out for war research on biomedical problems  particularly wound repair and the treatment of burns  the MIT biology staff  under Dr. Schmitt's direction  started an intensive program of teaching and research in molecular biology with the use of all available biophysical and biochemical techniques.In his fundamental biological research  Dr. Schmitt used such tools and techniques of experimental physics as the X-ray  polarized light  spectroscopy and the electron microscope. He was one of the world's foremost authorities on the biological uses of the electron microscope  the instrument which made possible the direct photography and study of biomolecular structures.Nerves  muscle  collagen  membranes  fibrils and other cellular structures were given special study. Many of the students of those days went on to become world leaders in molecular biology.Dr. Schmitt's trailblazing studies included research on kidney function  conduction in heart muscle  tissue metabolism  chemistry and physiology of nerves  ultrasonic radiation  properties of surface films  biochemistry and electrophysiology of nerves  and analysis of molecular architecture of cells and tissues.This productive program was complemented in the early 1950s by the establishment  under Dr. Schmitt's initiative  of a Division of Biochemistry to provide a parallel concentration in this area of modern analytical biology.As professor of biology  Dr. Schmitt headed MIT's department from 1942 to 1955  when he was freed from his administrative duties so that he could devote all his attention to teaching and research. It was at this time that he was appointed Institute Professor  a distinguished academic post that recognizes outstanding achievement.The current head of the department  Nobel laureate Phillip A. Sharp  said: "Frank's leadership was critical in developing modern biochemistry and cellular biology at MIT and his spirit will be greatly missed."Dr. Schmitt's standing as a significant figure in 20th century American science was enhanced  beginning in 1962  when he devoted much of his time to the Neurosciences Research Program (NRP) which he established with headquarters at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The program provided a focus  through conferences and publications  for research in neurosciences throughout the world.It was a program in which mathematicians  physicists  chemists and engineers joined with experts in various biomedical sciences dealing with nerves  brain and behavior to investigate the physiochemical and biophysical bases of mental processes such as long-term memory  learning and consciousness.An interdisciplinary  inter-university organization  the NRP was Dr. Schmitt's means for promoting research in what he considered the last frontier of science  the brain and brain function.One scientific publication  which described Dr. Schmitt as a "scientific impresario " said the NRP represented Dr. Schmitt's attempt to get science's "wets" (chemists) and "drys" (physicists) together to work on the mystery of the brain.Althoughly largely supported by federal and private funds  the NRP had an academic affiliation with MIT.Dr. Schmitt was chairman of the NRP from 1962 to 1974. In 1981 the NRP moved to Rockefeller University.Dr. Schmitt remained at MIT to continue his research in molecular genetics and he continued to pursue his research interests following his official retirement from MIT in 1969.As one interviewer reported  Dr. Schmitt was determined to turn "retirement" into opportunities to get "re-tired " with another set of tires  and to take off full tilt down other interesting avenues of research.Before his official retirement from MIT he had been the leader of a lively research program at MIT on the biophysics and biochemistry of nerves. The program included the isolation of the fibrous protein of nerves.Most nerves are small and hard to get at chemically. However the squid  a 10-armed marine animal related to the octopus  has very large nerve fibers from which pure axoplasm  the inner core of the nerve fiber  can be extracted with comparative ease. MIT nerve research concentrated on studies of this material and  during the summer  40 or more squid were delivered to the Institute every day and kept alive in circulating sea water until they were ready for dissection. In 1957  Dr. Schmitt arranged to obtain axoplasm from the large nerve fibers of giant squid caught off the coast of Chile especially for MIT.Born in St. Louis in 1903  Dr. Schmitt received the AB degree in 1924 and PhD in medical science in 1927 from Washington University. His father had wanted him to be a surgeon  but Dr. Schmitt ceased his medical studies to concentrate on the fields of chemistry and biology.After receiving his PhD  Dr. Schmitt did advanced study at the University of California  University College in London  and Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (now Max Planck Institute). In 1929 he was appointed to the faculty of Washington University and moved up in the ranks to become head of the department of zoology there by the time he came to MIT as a full professor.His many awards and honors included the Albert Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association  the Alsop Award of the American Leather Chemists Association and the T. Duckett Jones Award of the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation. He received honorary doctorate degrees from a number of universities. He was a member of many scientific and learned associations including the National Academy of Sciences  the American Philosophical Society and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  from which he received an honorary MD degree  and former president of the Electron Microscope Society of America. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Dr. Schmitt had a longtime love of classical music  inspired by the artistry of his wife  Barbara  a former concert pianist who died in 1975.He leaves a daughter  Marion Ellis of Cambridge; a son  Robert H. Schmitt of San Diego; a brother  Otto H. Schmitt of Minneapolis  six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon October 4  1995.

H.S. Bridge  scientist who mapped solar winds  dies at 76,A memorial service for Professor Emeritus Herbert S. Bridge will be held in the MIT Chapel at 1:30pm on Thursday  Sept. 14.Dr. Bridge  professor emeritus of physics and an internationally known space scientist who played a key role in mapping the solar winds that flow through interplanetary space  died August 30 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness. Dr. Bridge  who lived in Sudbury  was 76. The family said the cause of death was coronary artery disease.As associate director and later director of the MIT Center for Space Research  Professor Bridge was one of the pioneers in the exploration of the solar system from unmanned spacecraft.He was the leader of a group of physicists at MIT who designed and constructed a novel instrument for the study of interplanetary plasma  the modulated-grid Faraday cup. This instrument  successfully flown aboard Explorer X in the spring of 1961  for the first time provided direct evidence for the existence of a dilute plasma in interplanetary space (the supersonically expanding outer atmosphere of the sun)  as well as supplying some preliminary information of the density and velocity of this plasma.After that initial discovery  Professor Bridge was principal investigator on space plasma experiments aboard unmanned scientific missions to every planet in the solar system with the exception of Pluto.The pioneering work of Professor Bridge and his collaborators received worldwide recognition and the MIT group acquired a leading position in the field of plasma measurements in outer space. Plasma probes have been successfully flown on seven NASA earth satellites  two deep space probes and four planetary missions.These experiments have provided a wealth of accurate data on the properties of the interplanetary plasma  on the earth's magnetosphere  and on the interaction of the solar wind with the Moon  Venus and Mercury  Mars  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus and Neptune.Professor Bridge's plasma experiment on board the Voyager spacecraft directly measured the properties of plasmas originating from the volcanoes on Io (the innermost Galilean satellite of Jupiter)  from the dense atmosphere of Titan (the large satellite of Saturn)  from the upper atmosphere of Uranus  and from Triton (the large satellite of Neptune). Ultimately  his experiment on the Voyager spacecraft may measure the plasma in the interstellar medium. The Voyager spacecraft are currently at about 50 Astronomical Units from the Sun  and continue to measure the properties of the distant solar wind.Professor Bridge obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland in 1941. During the war  he was a member of the staff of the National Defense Research Council Separation Project at Princeton and then a member of the staff of the Los Alamos Laboratories.In 1946 he came to MIT  where he received his PhD in 1950. From 1950 until 1966 he was a member of the research staff of MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. During 1957  he took a leave of absence from MIT to work at the CERN Laboratory at Geneva  Switzerland. He did work on high-energy particles at CERN and at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Hajime Mitarai of Corporation,Hajime Mitarai  the president of Canon  Inc. of Tokyo  who was elected to the MIT Corporation in June  died August 31 in a Tokyo hospital at the age of 56. His death was attributed to complications from pneumonia.Dr. Mitarai received the SB  SM and EE in electrical engineering from MIT in 1965. He worked at the Corning Glass Works from 1966 until 1972 and received a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1973. He joined Canon  which was co-founded by his father  who also served as its first president  in 1974.Dr. Mitarai was in charge of research and development activities starting in 1978  helping turn the electronics manufacturer into one of the world's most innovative companies. According to The New York Times  Canon last year was awarded more American patents than any company except IBM and has consistently been in the top five companies in the number of American patents obtained.Dr. Mitarai  who became president and representative director of the company in 1993  emphasized the development of unique products. The key to innovation  he said  was to stress individual effort as opposed to group effort common in Japanese companies.Among his many accomplishments  he helped oversee the development of the laser printer and also bubble jet printing  which produces clear letters at a relatively low cost.Dr. Mitarai came to the United States for his education  something unusual for a Japanese in those days  after graduating from high school in Tokyo in 1957. He actively supported MIT  having served as president of the MIT Association of Japan since 1990.MIT Chairman Paul E. Gray  in a letter to Corporation members  said Dr. Mitarai had "looked forward with great anticipation to his first Corporation meeting in October  which would have coincided with his 57th birthday. His presence and enthusiasm will be sorely missed."Dr. Gray added that Dr. Mitarai had been his student "and he and his wife have been personal friends since those student days."Memorial resolutions will be presented at the annual meeting of the Corporation in October.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon September 13  1995.

Dr. Herbert S. Bridge Dies at 76,CAMBRIDGE  Mass.-- Dr. Herbert S. Bridge  professor emeritus of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an internationally known space scientist who played a key role in mapping the solar winds that flow through interplanetary space  died August 30 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness. Dr. Bridge  who lived in Sudbury  MA  was 76.The family said the cause of death was coronary artery disease.As associate director and later director of the MIT Center for Space Research  Professor Bridge was one of the pioneers in the exploration of the solar system from unmanned spacecraft.He was the leader of a group of physicists at MIT who designed and constructed a novel instrument for the study of interplanetary plasma  the modulated-grid Faraday cup. This instrument  successfully flown aboard Explorer X in the spring of 1961  for the first time provided direct evidence for the existence of a dilute plasma in interplanetary space (the supersonically expanding outer atmosphere of the sun)  as well as supplying some preliminary information of the density and velocity of this plasma.After that initial discovery  Professor Bridge was principal investigator on space plasma experiments aboard unmanned scientific missions to every planet in the solar system  with the exception of Pluto.The pioneering work of Professor Bridge and his collaborators received worldwide recognition and the MIT group acquired a leading position in the field of plasma measurements in outer space. Plasma probes have been successfully flown on seven NASA earth satellites  two deep space probes and four planetary missions.These experiments have provided a wealth of accurate data on the properties of the interplanetary plasma  on the earth's magnetosphere  and on the interaction of the solar wind with the Moon  Venus and Mercury  Mars  Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus  and Neptune.Professor Bridge's plasma experiment on board the Voyager spacecraft directly measured the properties of plasmas originating from the volcanoes on Io (the innermost Galilean satellite of Jupiter)  from the dense atmosphere of Titan (the large satellite of Saturn)  from the upper atmosphere of Uranus  and from Triton (the large satellite of Neptune). Ultimately  his experiment on the Voyager spacecraft may measure the plasma in the interstellar medium. The Voyager spacecraft are currently at about 50 Astronomical Units from the Sun  and continue to measure the properties of the distant solar wind.Professor Bridge obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland in 1941. During the war  he was a member of the staff of the National Defense Research Council Separation Project at Princeton and then a member of the staff of the Los Alamos Laboratories.In 1946 he came to MIT where he received his Ph.D. in 1950. From 1950 until 1966 he was a member of the research staff of MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. During the year 1957  he took a leave of absence from MIT to work at the CERN Laboratory at Geneva  Switzerland. He did work on high-energy particles at CERN and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He was appointed professor of physics at MIT in 1966.His early work in cosmic rays was mainly directed toward the study of nuclear interactions produced by cosmic ray particles and of the new unstable particles resulting from these interactions.Professor Bridge was Associate Director of the MIT Center for Space Research from its inception in 1965 until 1978.

Professor emeritus George Bekefi dies at 70,Professor emeritus George Bekefi  a physics researcher and faculty member for 38 years  died August 17 at his home in Brookline. His family said the cause of death was leukemia.Dr. Bekefi  who was 70  retired from the MIT faculty this summer.He was widely known for his contributions in the field of plasma physics  particularly in the production of extremely high-powered microwave generators and  more recently  in the development of free-electron lasers which are used as power sources in high-frequency bands. The free-electron lasers are useful in a wide variety of areas including communications  bulk chemical processing  fusion  and cutting  drilling and welding.In 1976  Dr. Bekefi and a staff researcher  Dr. Thaddeus Orzechowski  developed a source of radiation that produced bursts of microwaves some 50 times more powerful than the largest conventional microwave generators then in existence.Dr. Bekefi also was highly regarded as a teacher. In an article he submitted this summer to his department's newsletter  he wrote: "Revealing to hundreds of undergraduates the mysteries of physics and guiding some 50 graduates towards their MS and PhD degrees  I am retiring after 38 fun-drenched years. Throughout  it has been a most delightful experience."Professor Bekefi was born on March 14  1925 in Prague  Czechoslovakia  in his words to "a painter father and mysticism-oriented mother." After occupation of that country by Nazi Germany in 1939  he made his way to England under the aegis of the British government in its effort to rescue Jewish children.He received a bachelor of science degree from University College in London in 1948 with first-class honors in physics and mathematics. Then  "itching for some adventures in the New World " he went to McGill University in Montreal as an instructor in the physics department. He received a master's degree there in 1950 and PhD in 1952.He remained at McGill until 1957  first as research associate and later as assistant professor. He joined MIT's Plasma Physics Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics  with which he was affiliated throughout his career  and became an assistant professor in the Department of Physics in 1961. He was promoted to associate professor in 1964 and professor in 1967.In his article for the departmental newsletter  Professor Bekefi said his arrival at MIT opened an entirely new field of research for him."Gaseous electronics soon began to play an important role in the operations of the newly discovered laser where the ionized gas became the lasing medium " he wrote. "At the Second Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy  held in 1958 in Geneva  controlled thermonuclear fusion was declassified and thus opened a vista for many young scientists. George and his students began to explore linear and nonlinear wave propagation in hot plasmas and the various emission processes from this novel medium. In the mid-1970s George was ready to explore new fields. It was his good fortune that at an earlier period. he met and worked with Hans Motz  the pioneer of free-electron lasers. And thus began George's love affair with relativistic electron beams and ways of coaxing them to emit coherent electromagnetic radiation " work than he continued until his retirement.In 1966  Professor Bekefi was a Visiting Fellow at St. Catherine's College  Oxford  and in 1972 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship  working at the University of Paris and at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.He was the author or co-author of three books and more than 180 scientific papers  and the recipient of seven patents. The books included Radiation Processes in Plasmas (1966) and  in 1977  an undergraduate text (with A.H. Barrett)  Electromagnetic Vibrations  Waves and Radiation. He also was editor and co-author of a monograph  Principles of Laser Plasmas  published in 1976.His awards included this year's Free-Electron Laser Award by the American Physical Society; the Gold Honorary Medal for Merit in the field of Physics Sciences from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in 1993; and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' Plasma Science and Applications Prize in 1989. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and chairman of the Society's Division of Plasma Physics in 1978.He leaves his wife  Chaia; a son  Ariel; and a daughter  Tamara  all of Brookline.There was a graveside service Sunday  August 20  at the Temple Emeth Memorial Park in West Roxbury.--------------------------------------Dr. David ShoemakerDr. David P.

Senior trustee  Thomas D. Cabot  dies at 98,Thomas Dudley Cabot  the longest serving member of the MIT Corporation  died June 8 at his home in Weston at the age of 98.Mr. Cabot  a Life Member Emeritus of the Corporation who was first appointed as a term member in 1946  regularly attended meetings of the trustees until shortly before his death and marched in the 1994 Commencement procession.In fact  Mr. Cabot  who was director emeritus of Cabot Corp.  manufacturer of petrochemicals  still went to his Boston office at 75 State St. from his home in Weston on a "very regular basis " according to a company spokesperson. "I manage to find something to do " he said in an interview in 1992.MIT Chairman Paul E. Gray and President Charles M. Vest took note of Mr. Cabot's 95th birthday in 1992 in a letter they sent to him. "We count ourselves fortunate indeed to have your continued participation in the MIT Corporation meetings " it said. "The fact that you. take an interest in the many issues associated with the governance of the Institute is deeply inspiring to your MIT trustee colleagues and to us. Your wisdom and your support are always there when needed."Although he played an important role in MIT's affairs  and with other family members was an MIT benefactor  Mr. Cabot did not graduate from the Institute. He took courses at MIT when it was called Boston Tech and located on Boylston Street  Boston. The courses-which included thermodynamics  aerodynamics and shop practice-were taught by faculty members with joint appointments at MIT and Harvard. He was enrolled at Harvard and received his bachelor's degree in engineering there  cum laude  in 1919.His father  Godfrey Lowell Cabot  attended MIT for one year in 1877-78 and graduated from Harvard with a degree in chemistry in 1881. He also served many years on the MIT Corporation starting in 1930  and became a Life Member.Still another member of the family is currently a Life Member of the Corporation. He is Thomas Cabot's son  Louis W. Cabot  a Harvard graduate and also a director emeritus of Cabot Corp.Thomas Cabot was born in Cambridge into one of Boston's oldest families on May 1  1897  the son of Godfrey and Maria Moors Cabot. On graduation from college  he entered his father's business in West Virginia. He expanded it to other states and eventually into foreign countries while broadening the fields of its interest into a diversity of products. The company now is the leading producer of carbon black-the material that helps produce automobile tires  paint and printing ink-and a supplier of raw materials to a variety of industries  with annual sales of $1.7 billion.Mr. Cabot  with 49 unbroken years of service to MIT  was elected a Life Member of the Corporation in 1951 and Life Member Emeritus in 1972. He served on many of the Corporation Standing and Visiting Committees and served a number of terms as chairman of Visiting Committees. He also took on additional tasks as they arose.In 1960 he established the Thomas Dudley Cabot Scholarship Fund as part of the permanent endowment. There have been other gifts in his and his family's name and  in 1977  members of Mr. Cabot's family honored him by endowing the Thomas Dudley Cabot Institute Chair.He has also served the government in a number of capacities. In 1951 during the Korean War President Harry S. Truman appointed him director of International Security Affairs in the Department of State  in charge of rearming Europe.A former president of United Fruit Co.  Mr. Cabot also served on the boards of a number of institutions in the industrial  educational and philanthropic fields. He held honorary degrees from several universities  including Harvard  where he served two terms as an Overseer.A man of action since his days as a flying officer in the Army during World War I  he was a trophy-winning sailor whose latest book was Avelinda: The Legacy of a Yankee Yachtsman. His love of the outdoors also included canoeing  skiing  hiking and camping. In 1934  he co-authored Quick Water and Smooth  the first canoe guide to New England rivers. He had been president of both The Appalachian Mountain Club and the Harvard Travellers Club.Services were held June 14 in Harvard University's Memorial Church.He leaves his wife  Virginia (Wellington) of Weston; four sons  Louis W. of Boston  Thomas D. Jr. of Greenwich  CT  Robert M. of England and Edmund B. of Belmont; a daughter  Linda Black of Cambridge; 29 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon June 21  1995.

Professor Elting E. Morison dies at 85,Elting E. Morison  one of the nation's most distinguished historians and a founder of MIT's Program in Science  Technology and Society (STS)  where he was a professor emeritus  died April 20 in Peterborough  NH. He was 85.A funeral service was held April 23 in the Unitarian Church  Peterborough. He was buried in Pine Hill Cemetery  Peterborough.His colleagues at STS are planning to honor his life and work in the fall with a special event that will focus on Professor Morison's contributions to the history of technology and to MIT.Professor Morison  who held the Elizabeth and James R. Killian Class of 1926 Chair  commanded wide attention for more than half a century with his writings on the social  political  intellectual and industrial history of the United States. The Boston Globe  reporting his death  called him "an educator and industrial historian who believed that technology could only be harnessed to serve human beings when scientists and poets could meet with mutual understanding."He first came to MIT in 1946 as an assistant professor of English in the Department of Humanities. Later  as a professor of industrial history at the Sloan School of Management  he directed a program designed to reveal the sweep of technological change as reported in the history of science  technology and industrial development.In 1966 he joined Yale University as master of Timothy Dwight College and professor of history and American studies. He returned to MIT in 1972 as the holder of the Killian chair.In the 1970s he played a major role in conceiving and planning what has become the interdisciplinary STS program through which MIT faculty and students focus on the ways in which scientific  technological and social factors interact.Professor Morison was born in Milwaukee on December 14  1909. He received the BA degree from Harvard in 1932 and the MA in 1937. He was assistant dean at Harvard from 1935 to 1937. During World War II he served in the Naval Reserve.In 1948 he became director of the Theodore Roosevelt Research Project which resulted in the publishing of an eight-volume series  The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt  of which he was editor from 1951-54.Other works include Admiral Sims and the Modern American Navy (1942)  which won him the American Historical Association's John H. Dunning Prize;Turmoil and Tradition (1960)  a biography of Henry L. Stimson  Secretary of State in the Hoover administration and later Secretary of War in the Roosevelt administration  which earned the Parkman Prize from the Society of American Historians; Men  Machines and Modern Times (1966) which won the Academy of Management's McKinsey Award; and his last book  From Know-How to Nowhere: The Development of American Technology  published in 1974.He is survived by his wife  Elizabeth (Forbes) Tilghman Morison; a son  Nicholas G. Morison; two daughters  Mary Morison Nur and Sarah Morison Ford; a brother  John Morison; four stepsons  Benjamin  William  Christopher and James Tilghman; and three grandchildren.A version of this article appeared inMIT Tech Talkon April 26  1995.

Obits/Ramsey of MITES is dead at 67,William H. Ramsey of MITES is dead at 67William H. Ramsey  a mentor and role model to hundreds of students as executive director of engineering special programs in the School of Engineering since 1988  died January 14 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 67.Dean Joel Moses of the School of Engineering said a memorial service will be held during the spring term."Bill was an alumnus  a colleague and a friend of whom we were all proud " Dean Moses said. "In his work  he was professional  straightforward and thorough. He brought to our students the benefit of many years of professional engineering and managerial experience. But we in the dean's office will remember him best for his sense of humor  his devotion to his family and his church  and his wonderful smile when the topic of St. Kitts came up." St. Kitts  where Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey had built a home  was where they planned to retire.Mr. Ramsey was responsible for the administration of the MITES program-Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science-and the Engineering Internship Program (EIP) in which students combine academic programs and on-the-job experience.MITES  now in its 21st year  annually brings to MIT each year 35 to 50 high school students between their junior and senior year who have an interest in studying science and engineering. The program received national news coverage last spring in the Wall Street Journal and  as a result  on ABC-TV's Nightline. The focus of the news coverage was a Washington  DC  student who realized his goal of being selected for the MITES program. As the MITES program drew to a close  the student was advised to further strengthen his academic tools before applying to MIT  and this was reported in a second Wall Street Journal article. The articles brought the program considerable public attention  both favorable and critical  and many letters and phone calls. Mr. Ramsey dealt with many of these  responding in his characteristically courteous  clear and calm manner.MIT President Charles M. Vest said Mr. Ramsey was "a dedicated and effective leader of educational efforts" and a "very warm and caring mentor."Some 800 young men and women have benefited from the MITES program over the years. Many had the good fortune to be here during the Ramsey years " President Vest said. "Their success and contributions to society are Bill's legacy. It is very painful to realize that he will not have the pleasure of the retirement years that he was about to enter. His death is a tragic loss to our community."In 1988  when his appointment in the School of Engineering was announced  Mr. Ramsey was quoted in Tech Talk as offering this advice to MITES students: "There are disciplines that you will learn in the sciences and engineering which will be valuable to you for the rest of your life no matter what you finally do in your professional work. This is a benefit which is not evident until you look back on what you have accomplished. Work hard  be diligent and this investment in your future will bring a positive return."Diligence  hard work  honesty and fairness were traits his colleagues associated with Mr. Ramsey.A native of Brooklyn  NY  he was a graduate of Brooklyn Technical High School. He received the SB in electrical engineering in 1951.He returned to the Institute in 1987 as an officer in the Industrial Liaison Office where he was responsible for research interactions between MIT and 18 computer and electric power companies in the United States and Europe.Between graduation from MIT and his return to the Institute  Mr. Ramsey spent 20 years in military electronics as a circuit designer and systems engineer and manager and 15 years in management consulting and the vice presidency of Ault  Inc.  an electronics firm in Minneapolis.At the time of his death he was a board member of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. He was a former president of the board of the City Mission Society in Boston. He was a resident of Newton.Mr. Ramsey is survived by his wife  Charlotte M. (Finley) Ramsey  a teacher in the Brookline schools; a son  Marc S. of Palo Alto  CA; a daughter  Lynne Clark of Pittsburgh; a brother  Roland of Barbados; and a granddaughter.A memorial service attended by about 300 people  many of them from MIT  was held January 19 at the Second Church in Newton/United Church of Christ  West Newton.Robert E. DurlandRobert E. Durland  66  retired manager of furnishings and furniture in the Office of Purchasing and Stores  died January 12  at his home in Sandwich.

President emeritus Jerome Wiesner is dead at 79,Jerome Bert Wiesner  president emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  former science adviser to President John F. Kennedy  and a leader for decades in shaping the nation's science and technology policies  died late Friday night (October 21) at his home in Watertown of heart failure.  He was 79 years old.A private family service was held Saturday. A memorial service will be held at MIT at a later date.A leading voice for decades in international efforts to control and limit nuclear arms  he was a key figure in the Kennedy administration in the establishment of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  in achieving a partial nuclear test ban treaty  and in the successful effort to restrict the deployment of antiballistic missile systems.At MIT  as dean of science  provost  and ultimately as president from 1971 to 1980  Dr. Wiesner played a major role as the Institute expanded and strengthened its teaching and research programs in the health sciences  social sciences  humanities and the creative arts.Dr. Wiesner was a man of science who was admired by both poets and politicians. In a poem composed in honor of his inauguration as MIT president in 1971  Archibald MacLeish wrote:A good man! Look at himthere against the time!He saunters along to hisplace in the world's weather lights his pipe  hitches his pants talks back to accepted opinion.Dr. Paul E. Gray  chairman of the MIT Corporation  who was chancellor during Dr. Wiesner's presidency and succeeded him as president  said:"From his days as group leader and division head in the Radiation Laboratory more than 50 years ago  through his presidency in the '70s  to the last years in which he has been the intellectual champion of the Media Laboratory  Jerry Wiesner was single-minded in his desire and efforts to strengthen and improve his beloved MIT."This special place has benefited beyond acknowledgment from his fierce belief in the value of racial  ethnic and gender diversity in this community  from his insistence on intellectual quality in our programs  and from his vision of the ways in which science and technology and the arts and humanities reinforce each other."He was  throughout his career  deeply concerned with the development of human capabilities and was mentor to us all. The Institute is much diminished by his death  as am I  who had the great fortune to be his close colleague for 30 years."President Charles M. Vest issued this statement:"With Jerry Wiesner's death  the world has lost a great educator and scientific statesman  MIT has lost a memorable leader  and I have lost a personal hero."I knew Jerry well only during his later years  but it was a true privilege to know and work with a man of such vision. He did much to build and define MIT as an institution that extends and transcends its core of science and engineering through creative engagement with the humanities  the arts and the social sciences. In later years  his view of the future societal role of the electronic media profoundly affected our education and research."His influence was felt far beyond MIT through his role as President Kennedy's science adviser and as an adviser to corporations  foundations and academies. His life-long commitment to matters of international understanding  environmental policy  arms control and nuclear non-proliferation has made a profound difference in our world. I will miss him. We all will miss him."Former MIT President Howard W. Johnson in 1966 appointed Dr. Wiesner as provost  the chief academic officer of MIT. When Mr. Johnson became chairman of MIT  Dr. Wiesner succeeded him as president. Mr. Johnson  whose interest in the arts also paralleled Dr. Wiesner's  issued this statement:"Jerome Wiesner was a creative force at MIT for the last half century. With his great technical and social inventiveness  he made notable contributions in a number of fields as a professor  an administrator and a corporation member. Beyond MIT  he made significant impacts in arenas ranging from arms control to the arts. He will be deeply missed at MIT. And for those of us who worked with him closely for many years  the loss is immeasurable."Long Career at MITDr. Wiesner took office as MIT's 13th president on July 1  1971  and served in that post until June 30  1980  when he retired and resumed the title of Institute Professor  a position reserved for a handful of the Institute's most distinguished faculty  and which he had held from 1962 to 1971. He was also elected a life member of the MIT Corporation.In his long career at MIT that began in 1942-Dr. Wiesner served as provost  dean of science  acting head of the then Department of Electrical Engineering and director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics.After his retirement as president  Dr. Wiesner devoted himself to teaching and research in technical and policy areas related to science  technology  and society  with a strong emphasis on halting the arms race.In February 1993  he collaborated with two other MIT scientists with long experience in the study of weapons and military policy-Institute Professor Philip Morrison and Dr. Kosta Tsipis-in calling for deep cuts in US military procurement and expenditures. They published their proposals in a booklet  "Beyond The Looking Glass: The United States Military in 2000 and Later."Dr. Wiesner  who battled back from a severe stroke in 1989 and recovered his ability to speak and walk with relative ease  continued to be active in a broad range of MIT affairs. As one of the founders of the Media Laboratory  he maintained his scholarly interests in the educational and creative uses of computers in an electronic age. The Media Laboratory and the List Visual Arts Center are both located in the Wiesner Building  a structure dedicated to him and his wife Laya in 1985.Within the scientific community  Dr. Wiesner was recognized as an authority on microwave theory  communication science and engineering  signal processing  radio and radar  military technology  disarmament  science policy and technical education.During World War II  he was a leader in the development of radar  and later was one of the principals in the conception of radio transmission by scatter techniques from the earth's ionosphere. Working with the late Institute Professor Norbert Wiener  he stimulated a major MIT research and teaching effort in living and human-made information systems.University of Michigan YearsDr. Wiesner was born in Detroit  MI  on May 30  1915  and grew up in Dearborn. He was educated in the Dearborn public schools and at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor  where he received bachelor of science degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics in 1937  the master of science degree in electrical engineering in 1938  and the doctor of philosophy degree in electrical engineering in 1950.As both an undergraduate and graduate student at Michigan  Dr. Wiesner was associate director of the university's radio broadcasting service. In addition  he participated in studies of acoustics and assisted in developing electronic techniques at the National Music Camp at Interlochen  MI.It was at the University of Michigan that he met a fellow mathematics major  Laya Wainger of Johnstown  PA. They were married in 1940. That same year he was appointed chief engineer for the Acoustical and Record Laboratory of the Library of Congress. There  under a Carnegie Corporation grant  he assisted in developing recording facilities and equipment and traveled through the South and Southwest with the noted folklorist Alan Lomax  recording the folk music of the regions for the Library of Congress Archives.Joined MIT's Radiation LabIn 1942  shortly after the United States became involved in World War II  Dr. Wiesner joined the research staff at MIT's newly formed Radiation Laboratory  where he worked on the development of microwave radar. He became an associate member of the laboratory's steering committee and was later the leader of Project Cadillac  which developed an airborne radar system that was the forerunner of the present AWAC system.In 1945  as the war came to an end  Dr. Wiesner briefly joined the staff at the University of California's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico  then returned to MIT in 1946 as assistant professor of electrical engineering. He was advanced to the rank of associate professor in 1947 and was made a full professor of electrical engineering in 1950.From 1946 to 1961 he worked at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics  which grew out of the wartime Radiation Laboratory as a multi-disciplinary  interdepartmental center for broad basic research in electronics  physics and communications. He held various positions at the laboratory  including assistant director  associate director and finally director.From 1959 to 1960 he was also acting head of the Department of Electrical Engineering (now the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)  the largest of MIT's academic departments. Dr. Wiesner's work and leadership in technical areas-particularly in fields of microwave theory  human and machine communications  scatter transmission techniques and engineering-have helped make MIT one of the leading electronics research centers in the world.Broad Advisory RoleThroughout his career  Dr. Wiesner was a frequent consultant and adviser to government agencies  particularly the Department of Defense and the Department of Health  Education and Welfare  on matters relating to science and technology. He became a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee in 1957 during the Eisenhower Administration. He also served as the technical director of the Gaither Panel  a study of civilian defense undertaken by the White House. In 1958 he served as staff director of the US delegation to the Geneva Conference for the Prevention of Surprise Attack. Also in 1958  Dr. Wiesner became associated with the Pugwash Group  scientists whose activities have been directed toward improving communications and relations between intellectual leaders in Communist bloc nations and those of the Western world.Dr. Wiesner took a three-year leave of absence from MIT starting in February 1961 to serve as special assistant to President Kennedy for Science and Technology and  simultaneously  as chairman of the President's Science Advisory Committee. He also held those posts for a short time under President Lyndon B. Johnson following the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. He returned to MIT as dean of the School of Science in 1964. He was appointed MIT provost on July 1  1966  starting a number of years of teamwork with Howard W. Johnson  who became MIT's president that year.In July 1971  Dr. Wiesner became president of MIT  succeeding Mr. Johnson  who became chairman of the Corporation.In addition to his responsibilities as president of MIT  Dr. Wiesner helped found the Massachusetts Science and Technology Foundation Board in 1970 and served as a member from 1970 to 1977. As a member of the board  he provided advice and consultation to the governor and other officers of the Commonwealth with respect to scientific and technological matters and also attempted to stimulate the growth of industry in the Commonwealth.He also was a leader in community affairs in Watertown  where he was a resident for many years and where he was twice elected to the School Committee  serving two terms (1966-1971). He also served one term on the Watertown Planning Board (1958-1960).From 1974 to 1981  Dr. Wiesner served on the Technology Advisory Council of Congress' Office of Technology Assessment  where he was elected chairman in January 1976.

President Emeritus Julius Adams Stratton dies at 93,A memorial service will be held in the fall for President Emeritus Julius Adams Stratton  an eminent scientist and educator who died June 22  at the age of 93.Dr. Stratton was president of MIT from 1959-66 and chairman of the board of the Ford Foundation from 1966-1971.Dr. Stratton had been associated with MIT continuously since his enrollment as an undergraduate in 1920  a period of great growth and change at MIT that paralleled significant and far-reaching developments in the fields of science and engineering. Interdisciplinary centers for the earth sciences  the life sciences  space research  materials science and engineering  and advanced engineering study were established and buildings erected to house them.In addition  he served several administrations through a variety of national boards and committees  participated actively in professional and scientific organizations  and was a trustee of a number of educational and cultural institutions.Howard W. Johnson  Dr. Stratton's successor  said in a statement "Julius A. Stratton's association with MIT spanned more than 70 years  from his days as an undergraduate until his death. His impact and influence on the Institute and all of its parts was a deep and positive one. A distinguished physicist and electrical engineer  his commitment to high standards and insistence on quality performance was a notable characteristic of all that he did and everything that he accomplished. As a professor and as the 11th president of MIT  his lifetime of exemplary achievement will be remembered and revered."Dr. Paul E. Gray  MIT's 14th president and now chairman of the MIT Corporation  said  "As professor  the first director of the first university interdepartmental laboratory  provost  chancellor  and as president  Jay Stratton provided distinguished  wise and compassionate leadership to the Institute during a time in which the relationship between the research universities and the federal government was in flux  and the complexion and mission of MIT was also in transition. Jay's strong commitment to the arts and humanities at MIT was particularly important in a period when those activities were first flowering."President Charles M. Vest said  "Jay Stratton's leadership in science and academia helped shape not only MIT  but institutions throughout the nation. Personally  Jay and his wife Kay were extremely gracious to us when my wife Becky and I came to MIT from Michigan in 1990. Their kindness  their friendship  and the value of their counsel to both of us have been inestimable."Dr. Stratton's personal characteristics and values were described in an anecdote told by an alumnus and recounted in MIT in Perspective  by Francis E. Wylie  director emeritus of the MIT News Office. The alumnus recalled that Dr. Stratton  his physics professor  once arrived at the classroom and announced  "There will be no class today. I apologize. I have not prepared." Mr. Wylie commented  "There are innumerable ways for a professor to cover up in such a situation-such as giving a quiz. It is characteristic of Stratton that he would not bluff  and this may have been the only occasion in his life that he was not prepared. Earnest and thoughtful  warm yet dignified  impatient only with bad intentions or sloppy work  Stratton was well qualified as the president who would guide MIT into its second century." [Mr. Wylie is director emeritus of the MIT News Office.]Dr. Stratton's centered on the developing field of communications and communication theory in the 1920s. In 1941 he published Electromagnetic Theory (New York: McGraw Hill Book Company  1941)  a volume widely acknowledged as a classic in the field. Italian  French  and Czechoslovakian editions have been published.As World War II approached  and MIT established the Radiation Laboratory in 1940 as the center for radar research in the United States  Dr. Stratton joined the staff as a member of the Theory Group and worked on the development of LORAN (Long Range Navigation)  which by the end of World War II covered nearly a third of the globe with radio beams enabling airplanes and ships to determine their location. In 1942 he went to Washington as an expert consultant to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. When communications for ferrying planes across the North Atlantic proved unsatisfactory because of the proximity of the magnetic pole  he went to Labrador  Greenland and Iceland to study the problem and subsequently recommended a very low-frequency system. In this post he served also as chairman of committees to improve the effectiveness of all-weather flying systems and of ground radar  fire control and radar bombing equipment. He visited North Africa  Italy and the United Kingdom to study radar bombing and to assist in planning the use of radar in the Normandy invasion. In 1946 he was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services.The Radiation Laboratory demonstrated impressively the value of interdisciplinary research and  as the end of the war neared  Dr. Stratton and others sought a way in which its momentum and program methods could be sustained for peacetime research. This was effected through the establishment at the Institute of a new Research Laboratory of Electronics  of which he became the first director. Its form of organization was so successful that it soon provided a pattern for interdisciplinary research in a variety of fields at MIT  and its example was followed at other institutions as well.While serving as director of the laboratory  Dr. Stratton continued to be active as a professor of physics and became increasingly involved in the affairs of the entire Institute. In 1947 he was one of five chosen by the faculty to comprise the Committee on Educational Survey  appointed to review the state of education at MIT  in the light of post-war developments and circumstances. He was chiefly responsible in 1949 for the final preparation of the committee's report  which reaffirmed the original concepts of the Institute  the principles of limited objectives and faculty unity  a continued strong commitment to undergraduate professional education  the partnership of education and research  and the importance of graduate education. In addition to reaffirming the status of science  engineering  and architecture as integral parts of the Institute's mission  the committee recommended that the social sciences and the humanities be strengthened within the context of MIT. In accordance with this recommendation  the School of Humanities and Social Sciences was created in 1950.Dr. Stratton's wife  Catherine N. Stratton  joined in many of her husband's concerns at MIT  particularly with respect to the arts. Her efforts brought into being a loan/lottery program through which students can obtain original works of art for their campus residences. MIT's Council for the Arts was created in 1971 as a result of her work and more recently she was instrumental in developing an annual seminar series for the MIT community on successful aging.In 1949 Dr. Stratton was appointed MIT's first provost and received an additional concurrent appointment as vice president in 1951. He was named chancellor in 1956 and became acting president in 1957  when President Killian was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower for science and technology. In January of 1959  Dr. Stratton became president  with Dr. Killian appointed chairman of the Corporation.Born in Seattle  on May 18  1901  Dr. Stratton and his forebears represent a remarkable span in American history. His grandfather was born in 1799  and his father in 1844  in Jefferson County  IN. At the age of nine the latter  with his mother and brothers and sisters  traveled in a covered wagon over the Oregon Trail to the Northwest  where the father had already staked a claim.When Dr. Stratton was a small boy  the family lived for a time in Dresden and Berlin  where his mother continued her study of music. He began his school days there  acquiring a knowledge of German that later was to prove useful. As a teenager in Seattle he developed a keen interest in the then-new field of radio and built his own set. Too young for military service when World War I began  he hoped that the Navy might overlook his age if he qualified for a commercial radio license  but the war was nearly over before he was ready. However  he secured a post as radio operator on Pacific coastal vessels and then on a ship carrying rails for the South Manchurian Railroad. Returning through the China Sea in a typhoon  young Stratton received an SOS from another ship loaded with Russian refugees which had been blown ashore in Japanese waters. Trying to aid the distressed vessel  his own ship  the Western Glen  went aground. Though it managed to extricate itself  it was not soon enough for him to reach home in time to apply for admission in the fall of 1919 to Stanford or Yale.He entered the University of Washington but after a year there decided to go to MIT  which he had learned about from a fellow student. Typically  he shipped as a radio operator on the Eastern Pilot  bound for New York by way of the Panama Canal  and arrived in Cambridge in September 1920  to find that tuition had been increased by $50 to $300 and that he would be allowed virtually no credit for his freshman year at the University of Washington. He was determined to finish in three years  and the necessary overload did not permit much time for anything but study. He did  however  serve as secretary of the Radio Society which operated a transmitter with a signal powerful enough to be received in Hawaii. His last trip as a commercial radio operator was in the summer of 1922 on the President Madison  its destination China and the Philippines. He was graduated from the Institute in 1923 with an SB degree in electrical engineering.In spite of his technical training  Dr. Stratton had developed a strong interest in the humanities  and he enrolled first at the University of Grenoble and then at the University of Toulouse with the intention of undertaking a doctoral dissertation on the influence of science on French literature. But the pull of science and engineering was too great and he returned to MIT for graduate study in electrical engineering. His master's thesis was completed in time for the degree list in January 1926.Next came the award of an MIT Traveling Fellowship in Mathematics and Physics  which took him to Zurich for doctoral study at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). There he worked under Peter Debye and received an ScD degree in mathematical physics in January 1928. An assistant professorship in electrical engineering brought him back to MIT. In 1930 he transferred to physics  where he became associate professor in 1935 and full professor in 1941.Much of his research concentrated on the propagation of short waves  about which less was known than the long waves then generally employed in radio transmission. His work and that of his colleagues on microwaves foreshadowed later efforts in the development of radar and the burgeoning of electronics after the war.His early years in physics coincided with a revitalization of that academic department  pressures for which had begun to emerge in the late 1920s and which  with the arrival of physicist Karl T. Compton as president of MIT in 1930  became a major Institute goal. New and far-reaching developments were taking place and the urge for reform and the study of physics for its own sake rather than simply as a service course for engineering students was given further impetus by the ideas and aspirations of young faculty members who  like Dr. Stratton  had recently returned from advanced study in Europe.In addition to Electromagnetic Theory  Dr. Stratton was the author of many articles and technical papers and of Elliptic Cylinder and Spheroidal Wave Functions with P.M. Morse  L.J. Chu and R.A. Hutner (1941)  and Spheroidal Wave Functions  with P.M. Morse  L.J. Chu  J.D.C. Little  and F.J. Corbato (1956). Science and the Educated Man  a collection of selected speeches  was published by the MIT Press at the time of his retirement in 1966.His years as a faculty member and administrator were marked by a deep concern for the individual and a genuine interest in students and their problems. He led major efforts in curriculum revision and in the development of the residential program  including a dormitory for women  apartments for married students  and increased recreational and athletic facilities. In 1965 the new student center was named  at the request of the students  the Julius Adams Stratton Building.Throughout the years he was an ardent spokesman for the nourishment of quality and a protagonist of the first-rate. He championed the importance of science at all levels of education and the need for humanistic studies in undergraduate scientific and engineering curricula. Above all  he believed firmly in the need for special institutions with well-defined objectives and "an intellectual environment in which imaginations are stirred  which fosters confidence that worthwhile things can be done  and where feelings of freedom and security go hand in hand with a sense of obligation and loyalty."When Dr. Stratton reached mandatory retirement age in 1966  he was elected a life member of the MIT Corporation and was a life member emeritus at the time of his death.In 1980  through a gift from William R. Hewlett  vice chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company and an alumnus of the Institute  the Julius A. Stratton Professorship in Electrical Engineering and Physics was established to be occupied alternately by a faculty member from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Physics.In 1966 Dr. Stratton became chairman of the board of the Ford Foundation  which ended with his second retirement in 1971. Here  too  he was remembered for the extraordinary breadth and warmth of his relationship with the staff  as counselor  source of inspiration and friend. Of his 16 years of service as member and as chairman  a trustee resolution on his retirement said in part: "He has demonstrated in every word and action the meaning of the standard to which he has held us all: that we are here to serve not our own ends but those for which the Ford Foundation is chartered. He leaves the Foundation stronger than he found it  and all who care for its work are deeply in his debt."Dr. Stratton returned to Cambridge in 1971 and in recent years had devoted his time and energies to the preparation of a history of MIT  with particular emphasis on the background of its founding and its development and growth in the 19th century.Dr. Stratton was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1950. In the early 1950s  Congress was pressing for a loyalty oath for individuals receiving federal research grants. In 1955  when the Academy was asked to consider this question  he was appointed chairman of a special committee known as the Committee on Loyalty in Relation to Government Support of Unclassified Research. The Committee outlined criteria for government policy with respect to such matters and recommended against special loyalty requirements for those involved in unclassified scientific research. Its recommendations were accepted by the Eisenhower administration in 1956.Dr. Stratton served as vice president of the Academy from 1961 to 1965 and during that period chaired an Academy committee which led to the creation under its aegis of the National Academy of Engineering  of which he became a founding member.He was a member also of the American Philosophical Society and the Council on Foreign Relations; a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Physical Society  and the American Association for the Advancement of Science; a life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; a member of Sigma Xi  Tau Beta Pi  and an eminent member of Eta Kappa Nu.He was a Life Trustee and Member of the Corporation of the Boston Museum of Science and member emeritus of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory  of which he was a director and member of the corporation from 1973 to 1979.He was a member of the National Science Board from 1956 to 1962 and again from 1964 to 1967  resigning when he was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to serve as chairman of the newly established Commission on Marine Science  Engineering and Resources. After a two-year study the commission issued a landmark report  "Our Nation and the Sea " that resulted in the formation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency as the central focus for marine activity and in the establishment of such programs as that of Coastal Zone Management. In 1969  he was awarded the Marine Technology Society Citation and was chosen Man of the Year by the National Fisheries Institute. He received the Individual Distinguished Achievement Award of the Offshore Technology Conference in 1971 and the Neptune Award of the American Oceanic Association in 1979.Dr. Stratton also received the Distinguished Public Service Award of the United States Navy (1957)  the Medal of Honor of the Institute of Radio Engineers (1957)  the Faraday Medal of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers (1961)  the Boston Medal for Distinguished Achievement (1966)  the Silver Stein Award of the MIT Center of New York (1967)  and the Bronze Beaver of the MIT Alumni Association (1968). Dr Stratton held 17 honorary degrees from colleges and universities in the US  Great Britain and Canada.His decorations included that of Commander of the Orden de Boyaca of Colombia (1964)  and Knight Commander  Order of Merit  of the Federal Republic of Germany (1966). He was an officer of the French Legion of Honor (1961)  an Honorary Fellow of the Manchester (England) College of Science and Technology (1963)  and an Honorary Member of the Senate of the Technical University of Berlin (1966). In 1966 he was the recipient of the first Julius Adam Stratton prize for cultural achievement awarded annually by the Friends of Switzerland to Americans or Swiss citizens who have studied or worked in each other's countries and whose achievements exemplify the fruitfulness of this exchange.Dr. Stratton is survived by his wife  Catherine N. (Coffman) Stratton; three daughters  Catherine Nelson Stratton of London  Mrs. Lew (Cary) F. Boyd of Newbury  MA  and Mrs. Laura Thoresby of London; and a granddaughter  Caroline Stratton Boyd.Remembrances may be sent to MIT (Treasurer's Office  238 Main St.  Cambridge 02141) for undergraduate scholarships in memory of Julius A.

Muriel Cooper  68  dies; noted graphic designer,Professor Muriel R. Cooper a designer  educator and researcher whose work has been internationally acknowledged in exhibits and publications  died of an apparent heart attack on May 26 at the New England Medical Center. Professor Cooper  who lived in Brookline  was 68.Ms. Cooper  professor of interactive media design in the Program in the Media Arts and Sciences at the School of Architecture and Planning  cofounded and directed MIT's Visible Language Workshop at the Media Laboratory."She was a remarkable woman " said Professor Stephen A. Benton  head of the Program in Media Arts and Sciences who has worked closely with her over the years. "As a founding member of the Media Laboratory  she was a wise counselor in shaping our evolution. After 15 years of leadership in graphic design  she was just reaching the fullest expression of her computational design genius."Professor Nicholas P. Negroponte  director of the Media Laboratory  said  "We have lost the leader of the most revolutionary thought about graphics and computers. All of us at the Media Lab and elsewhere  who learned so much from Muriel  are now tasked [sic] to carry those concepts forward without her  which will be very difficult but very likely  given the large number of creative minds she spawned in her teaching  her research and her very being."Ms. Cooper's teaching and research at the Visible Language Workshop focused on how computers can enhance the graphic communication process and  inversely  how high-quality graphics can improve computer information systems."When you start talking about design in relation to computers " she said in a recent interview  "you're not just talking about how information appears on the screen  you're talking about how it's designed into the architecture of the machine and of the language. You have different capabilities  different constraints and variables than you have in any other medium  and nobody even knows what they are yet."Ms. Cooper came to MIT in 1952 as director of the Institute's newly formed Office of Publications  now known as Design Services. After leaving MIT in 1958 to take a Fulbright Scholarship in Milan  she returned to Boston and ran her own graphics studio for several years  with the MIT Press among her clients. During that time  she designed the world-famous logo for the MIT Press.In 1967  she joined the MIT Press as its first art director and became widely recognized for her innovations in book design. Her work in print includes over 500 books  more than 100 of which have been awarded recognition in various competitions. Her best known book was the Bauhaus volume.After seven years at the MIT Press  she started teaching a subject at MIT called Messages and Means which looked at graphics in relation to technology. The course was co-taught with Ronald L MacNeil  now a principal research associate in the Media Lab.She became an assistant professor in the Department of Architecture in 1977  the first graphic designer appointed to the faculty. She was promoted to associate professor in 1981 and professor in 1988.Professor Cooper received a BS degree in education from Ohio State University in 1944  and both the BFA in design and BS in education from the Massachusetts College of Art  in 1948 and 1951 respectively.In 1992  she was the first recipient of the Robert P. Gersin Design Excellence Award given to a graduate of the Massachusetts College of Art.She is survived by two sisters  Helene Jackson of Boston and New York City  and Charlotte Lopoten of Philadelphia.A memorial service will be held at MIT on a date to be announced.A version of this

His responsibilities included personnel  the medical department  public relations  admissions  athletics  career services and the MIT Press. He also served as the Institute's Equal Opportunity Officer.MIT President Charles M. Vest said  "I am stunned by the sudden death of this close and valued colleague. The loss to MIT is incalculable. Constantine Simonides infected MIT with warmth and humanity. Through the force of his ebullient personality and through the boundless energy he applied to everything he did  he made MIT a happy  satisfying place to work. He was skilled at developing the best in people. He knew everybody and held them in the same respect whether they were student  custodian  administrator  professor or trustee."As vice president and secretary of the MIT Corporation  he kept the president's interaction with the trustees organized and flowing smoothly. His near-photographic memory regarding facts and happenings was legendary and a great asset in the conduct of his duties. Still  his greatest talent was a never-ending fascination with and insight into people. Constantine left an imprint on MIT that will serve us well for many  many years into the future " Dr. Vest said.For the past five years  Mr. Simonides was the senior executive and chief strategist in the successful campaign to convince the US Justice Department that MIT's cooperation with other colleges in granting more than $25 million of need-based scholarship aid to its students was not a violation of the Sherman antitrust act. The Justice Department dropped the case last December.Thane Scott  the lead attorney for Palmer and Dodge in MIT's financial aid antitrust case  said: "Constantine's unlimited curiosity and enthusiasm energized the lives of his many friends and colleagues. His deep and personal interest in the ideas and experiences of those around him made every contact with him memorable. All of us who were privileged to share his life will miss his practical wisdom  unparalleled good humor and extraordinary insight and intelligence."Mr. Simonides joined MIT in 1960 as assistant to the director of the Summer Session. He served as assistant director of International Programs in the Sloan School of Management (1962-64)  assistant dean of the Sloan School (1964-66)  and assistant to the president (1966-1970). He was appointed vice president by President Howard W. Johnson in June  1970. In October 1985  he was elected secretary and ex-officio member of the MIT Corporation.Paul E. Gray  chairman of the MIT Corporation  said "Constantine Simonides served the Institute  including its governing board  with absolute devotion and loyalty  with astonishing energy  and with an extraordinary degree of administrative creativity. He believed that MIT could become a better place for study and work-a greater contributor to education and research-and he saw it as his responsibility to help lift this special place to higher levels of performance. We were colleagues for nearly 30 years and I relied on him for advice and counsel  for sound judgment  for his Hellenic optimism and humor  and for a sustaining friendship. His death is a shocking loss to the Institute and to all of us who loved him and depended so fully on him."Mr. Simonides was born in Athens  Greece on May 5  1934. At the age of 17  he came to the United States as an exchange student to attend St. Andrew's School in Middletown  DE  under the auspices of the American Field Service International Scholarships.

Institute Professor Walle J.H. Nauta dies,Dr. Walle J.H. Nauta  Institute Professor emeritus and one of the world's leading authorities on the anatomy of the brain  died March 24  in Mt. Auburn Hospital. He was 77 and lived in Newton. He had been hospitalized a few days with a blood infection  a family member said.Dr. Nauta  one of the founders of the modern field of neuroscience  made singular contributions to the understanding of the structure and connectivity of the brain.Some 40 years ago  he developed techniques that enabled experimenters to trace fiber connections in the brain. He and other researchers used the method to chart systems in the forebrain of the mammalian species  in particular the limbic systems and the corpus striatum.Later he and his colleagues at MIT experimented with new technical approaches involving the use of enzymatic and radioactive tracer substances in the analysis of fiber connections in the brain.According to his colleagues and family  Dr. Nauta remained particularly proud of the stain he developed-the Nauta Silver Impregnation Method-to trace degenerating nerve fibers. In the book  Neuroanatomical Tract-Tracing Methods  Professor Lennart Heimer wrote that the method and its various modifications "breathed new life into neuroanatomy and were fundamental to the subsequent development of the neurosciences in general."When The Neurosciences Research Program awarded Dr. Nauta the F.O. Schmitt Medal and Prize in Neuroscience for 1983  it said that he "devised new experimental methods that... established systems neuroanatomy as a leading discipline in neuroscience... He more than any other has created the modern science of neuroanatomy."Dr. Nauta was born in 1916 in Medan  Indonesia. He attended the University of Leyden in the Netherlands from 1934 to 1941  and received an MD degree in 1942 and a PhD in anatomy and neurophysiology in 1945 from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands.During World War II  from 1940 until the time the Netherlands was liberated by the Allies in 1945  Dr. Nauta and his wife  Ellie  hid a teenage Jewish girl while living in a one and one-half room apoartment with their own children.Dr. Nauta taught at the University of Utrecht from 1941 to 1946  the University of Leyden in 1946-47  and the University of Zurich in Switzerland from 1947 to 1951. From 1951 to 1964 he was a neurophysiologist in the Division of Neuropsychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington  DC.He was a professor in the Anatomy Department at the University of Maryland from 1955 to 1964  when he came to MIT as a professor of neuroanatomy in what was then the Department of Psychology  now called the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. He also was appointed a neuroanatomist on the staff of the McLean Hospital in Belmont in 1975. Dr. Nauta retired from MIT in 1986.Dr. Nauta was the author or co-author of more that 100 papers for professional journals and books  the most recent in 1993.He was a member of several honorary and professional societies  including the National Academy of Sciences  the American Philosophical Society  the Society for Neuroscience  which he served as president  the American Association of Anatomists and the American Neurological Association.He was the recipient of many honors and honorary degrees  among them the 1964 American Philosophical Society's Karl Spencer Lashley Award for Research in Neurobiology; the 1973 Henry Gray Award of the American Association of Anatomists; and the 1975 Distinguished Research Award of the American Neurological Association.In 1973  Dr. Nauta's colleagues at MIT bestowed on him the title of Institute Professor  an honor of special distinction that recognized his excellence as a teacher as well as his scholarly accomplishments.On April 25  Dr. Nauta was to have received a special award in neurosciences from the National Academy of Sciences in a ceremony in Washington  DC. His award was for "extraordinary contributions to progress in the field of neuroscience and for development of a powerful method for determining connectivity among specific brain sites and thus establishing now classical circuits in the limbic system."Private services were held on Monday  March 28.Besides his wife  Ellie (Plaat) Nauta  he is survived by two daughters  Tjalda Belastock of Newton and Janneke Bogyo of Lewiston  NY; and a son  Haring J. Nauta of Galveston  TX.A version of this

Obituary/Charles Kingsley,Charles Kingsley  Jr.  associate professor emeritus of electrical engineering who was associated with MIT as student and teacher for nearly 50 years  taught at MIT for more than 40 years  died February 20 at the age of 89 in Mt. Lebanon  PA.Professor Kingsley  an authority on rotating machines  magnetic circuits and other power apparatus  received the SB and SM degrees from MIT in 1927 and 1928.Between 1929 and 1940  when he joined the faculty  he was an instructor in the Department of Electrical Engineering. During his career he also spent time at the General Electric and Boeing Aircraft companies and at Dartmouth College. After his retirement in 1970  he continued to work on research projects at MIT  including the superconducting generator  for a few years.When it came time to connect the superconducting generator to the MIT power grid  Professor Gerald L. Wilson recalls  the honor was given to Professor Kingsley to throw the switch. A number of things could have gone wrong  Professor Wilson noted  and Professor Kingsley later joked  "I was a professor emeritus and they let me do it because they couldn't fire me."Professor Kingsley taught widely in the undergraduate curriculum and published several papers on synchronous machines. He was the author  with Professor A. E. Fitzgerald  of the widely used textbook  Electric Machinery  first published in 1952 and recently brought up to date in a fifth edition by Dr. Stephen D. Umans. In 1943  Professor Kingsley and Professor Karl Wildes wrote the textbook Magnetic Circuits and Transformers. He also published papers jointly with Professors Waldo B. Lyon and Harold E. Edgerton.His books had the style  rare at the time but common today  of bridging the gap between basic science and engineering practice. They greatly influenced other textbooks and the way the subject of electric machinery was taught and they were translated into many languages.Professor Kingsley was an enthusiastic mountain climber  hiker and general outdoorsman. He climbed in both the Swiss Alps and the White Mountains of New Hampshire  and he hiked all the Presidential Peaks in both summer and winter. From the 1950s to the 1970s he was a member of the White Mountain Guide Book Committee of the Appalachian Mountain Club.Dr. Wilson  Vannevar Bush Professor  professor of electrical and mechanical engineering and former dean of the School of Engineering  was a close friend of Professor Kingsley for many years and eventually bought a cabin Professor Kingsley owned on the Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire."He had a deep love and respect for the outdoors which he shared enthusiastically with faculty colleagues and students for more than 50 years " Dr. Wilson said. Professor Kingsley kept a guest book at the cabin  which today is filled with the names of those from MIT who visited him there  Dr. Wilson added.Professor Kingsley was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and also was active in one of its predecessor societies  the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.He is survived by his wife  Rebecca  of Mt. Lebanon  PA; two daughters  Priscilla Sharpless of Phoenixville  PA  and Prudence Larson of Mt. Lebanon; five grandchildren; four great-grandchildren  and a sister.A version of this

Obituary/Pietro Belluschi,Pietro Belluschi  one of the world's leading architects who served as dean of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning for 14 years  died February 14 at his home in Portland  OR  at the age of 94.His buildings include MIT's MacGregor House dormitory at 450 Memorial Drive  opened in 1970.The New York Times described him as a modernist architect whose work ranged from elegantly simple structures at the start of his career to such massive urban skyscrapers as the Pan Am Building in New York City and the Bank of America in San Francisco. He participated in the design of more than 1 000 buildings in all  among them the Juilliard School of Music and Alice Tully Hall in New York  which were done in association with a colleague from MIT  Eduardo F. Catalano  now professor emeritus of architecture.Dean Belluschi  who came to the United States from Italy as an exchange student in 1923  was trained as an engineer at the University of Rome and studied at Cornell University.He was dean of the MIT school  the nation's oldest  from 1951 to 1965. He was widely known as an educator during this period  writing and lecturing frequently. But he continued his architectural practice  doing most of the work at a drafting board at his Back Bay home.At his retirement  MIT President Julius A. Stratton praised Dean Belluschi as "an inspiration to faculty members and students alike " adding that "his taste and judgment" had helped shape the Institute's own building plans and would be permanently reflected in the development of the campus during that period.He continued: "During a period when contemporary architecture was dominated by a spirit of impersonal functionalism  he sought to combine elegance and beauty with usefulness. Here at MIT his creative spirit has been a dominant factor in the development of the School of Architecture and Planning... He has brought to the Institute a number of outstanding new members to the faculty. He has supported with vigor and imagination the extension and strengthening of the graduate program in the Department of City and Regional Planning [now Urban Studies and Planning]. Outstanding among the developments in planning during his tenure as dean were the establishment in 1958 of the PhD degree in planning  and the founding  with Harvard  in 1959 of the Joint Center for Urban Studies."Dean Belluschi's first wife  the former Helen Hemmila  died in 1962. He is survived by his second wife  Marjorie  two sons  four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.A version of this

Gregory Smith dies at 86,Gregory Smith  86  a Life Member Emeritus of the MIT Corporation  died on January 25 at a nursing home in Nahant.Mr. Smith  who retired as president of the Eastman Gelatin Corporation in 1972  spent a major part of his retirement at MIT as an advocate for the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program  working with faculty members and industry to find ways to involve students in substantive research.For a number of years Mr. Smith was a member of the Corporation Joint Committee on Institute-wide Affairs  a group organized in 1969 to bring concerns of the community to the attention of the governing board. He was a member of many Corporation visiting committees as well.He was also a champion of the MIT Community Service Fund from its inception in 1969. As the Corporation's representative  he was co-chairman for many years  during which he and the faculty co-chairman personally visited department and laboratory heads to increase awareness of the charity's importance to the community. With his encouragement  giving to the fund grew from $40 000 to more than $100 000 annually.Mr. Smith was a lifelong resident of Marblehead  where he and his wife were activists in historic preservation efforts and instrumental in the establishment of a historic district. For many years they lived in an 18th century mansion which they opened to the public for charitable events.He received the SB (1930) and SM (1931) degrees from MIT in chemical engineering and joined the Eastman Kodak Company. He was transferred to the Eastman Gelatin Corporation in Peabody in 1949 and became its president in 1957. He was particularly dedicated to extension of the company's affirmative action and community service efforts.In his own community activities  Mr. Smith was a long-time trustee and former president of the J.B. Thomas Hospital in Peabody  where a wing is named in his honor. He was also a trustee of Salem Hospital  the Robert Breck Brigham Hospital  the Salzberg Seminar in American Studies  the Massachusetts Bay United Way and the George Eastman House.Mr. Smith's wife  Doris King Smith  died in March 1993. He is survived by a son  David K. (Deke) Smith of Cambridge and three granddaughters.A version of this

Professor Roger G. Burns of EAPS (obit),An MIT memorial service is being planned for Roger G. Burns  professor of mineralogy and geochemistry in the Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Professor Burns  56  who lived in Cambridge  died January 7 of cancer in Mt. Auburn Hospital in Cambridge.He was well known for his major role in developing mineral spectroscopy and as the author of an influential book  Mineralogical Applications of Crystal Field Theory  first published in 1970 and reissued in a second edition in 1993. It showed clearly how laboratory study of minerals interpreted in the context of crystal field theory leads to an understanding of mineral structure that could not be obtained by other research techniques.Professor Burns  born in Wellington  New Zealand  received his bachelor and master of science degrees from Victoria University of Wellington and a PhD in geochemistry from the University of California  Berkeley  in 1965. During his graduate studies in the United States  Dr. Burns recognized that there was much to be learned in applying the instrumental and theoretical capabilities of chemistry to geology.His PhD thesis was a breakthrough in using chemical principles to understand the bonding environment of transition metals in silicate minerals. In particular  he was a pioneer in using absorption spectra to study minerals. In this technique the selective absorption of light with different wavelengths reveals the location and atomic coordination of transition metals in minerals.Professor Burns joined the faculty at MIT in 1970 as associate professor and within two years he was promoted to professor. At MIT his expertise in mineralogy and geochemistry and rapport with students led to innovative research. In addition to his energetic pursuit of the application of spectroscopic techniques to mineralogical problems  he broke new ground in several areas of earth and planetary science. In the 1970's  he and his wife  Virginia  were instrumental in characterizing and understanding the ubiquitous formation of manganese-rich minerals on the sea floor.In recent years Professor Burns continued his interest in directly relevant research by evaluating the reactivity of zeolites in proposed repositories for high-level nuclear waste.He also made major contributions to understanding the composition and mineralogy of the Martian surface  culminating with his contributions a workshop titled "Chemical Weathering on Mars." Professor Burns' last words on the subject will appear in an abstract for the 1994 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.During his career Professor Burns supervised 23 PhD and 10 master's theses  published more than 140 research papers  served as an editor for several journals and books  and received many honors  awards and fellowships  including an honorary MA in geology and a DSc in mineralogy from Oxford and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1991.Professor Burns' non-scientific interests included distance running. He often commuted this way between MIT and his Cambridge home  a distance of about five miles  and he was a frequent finisher of the Boston marathon.His survivors include his wife  Virginia  of Cambridge  and his sons  Kirk of Marietta  GA  and Jonathan of Cambridge.A version of this

Joint service planned for air accident victims,A joint memorial service is being planned for two MIT students killed November 21 in the Northampton  Mass.  crash of single-engine plane that went out of control after a freefalling skydiver slammed into aircraft. No date has been set  but the service probably will be next week.The students  Jonas R. Klein  18  a freshman who was a pledge at Tau Epsilon Phi  and Christina Park  18  a sophomore majoring in biology who lived at Senior House  were returning to campus from Poughkeepsie  NY. Also killed were Elliot Klein  49  Jonas's father  of Rhinebeck  NY  who was flying the plane  and  Jean Kimbal  45  of Pine Plains  NY  a friend of the Klein family  who went along for the ride. The skydiver  Alfred E. Peters  51  of Westfield  MA  survived. He suffered a broken ankle.The incident occurred above Northampton Airport in western Massachusetts  near the banks of the Connecticut River. Officials said the skydiver was the first of five to leave the plane at about 7 800 feet. The collision with the plane carrying the MIT students occurred at about 7 000 feet  according to newspaper and wire service reports that quoted an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. Mr. Peters struck the rear of the plane  damaging the vertical stabilizer. After hitting the plane he was able to open his parachute and land in the designated area  officials said.News reports also said that the single-engine plane should not have been flying in the designated skydiving zone. Officials said the pilot apparently was not tuned to the proper frequency to hear warnings about the jump zone.As the news of the crash spread across campus November 21 and the next day  students met with faculty house residents and members of Dean of Students office.Mr. Klein  who was to have been initiated as a brother of his fraternity soon  was a graduate of Northfield-Mt. Hermon School in Northfield  Mass. His home was in the western Massachusetts town of Monterey. A statement by Adam C. Ganderson of TEP  also a freshman  was released to The Tech. It said: "The brothers and friends of Tau Epsilon Phi mourn the loss of our brother Jonas. He was a hacker in very sense of the word and we're all going to miss him greatly. We send our love and condolences to his family  friends and everyone who knew him."A memorial service for Mr. Klein will be held Wednesday  Dec. 1  at Northfield-Mt. Hermon and several members of the MIT community are planning to attend.Mr. Klein is survived by his mother  Mrs. Victoria Reed.Ms. Park  from Auburn  WA  was a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School there. An oboe player  she had been a member of the Seattle Youth Symphony. Her friends at Senior House  and at East Campus where she lived last year  told The Tech they remembered her energy and creativity  her love for the field of biology  her quick and frequent smile  and her lack of fear about expressing her mind.Ms. Park is survived by her parents  James and Cecelia Park of Auburn  Wash.A version of this

Dec. 15 memorial planned for Bruno Rossi,A memorial service will be held on Wednesday  Dec. 15  at 4pm in the Little Theater for Dr. Bruno B. Rossi  Institute Professor emeritus and professor emeritus of physics.Dr. Rossi died November 21 at his home in Cambridge at the age of 88. One of the nation's most honored scientists  he played a leading role in the study of cosmic rays and in the development of space physics.Dr. Rossi  who had not been well for several years  died of cardiac arrest.In the 1930s  Dr. Rossi's experimental investigations of cosmic rays and their interactions with matter laid the foundation for high energy particle physics. Cosmic rays are atomic particles that enter earth's atmosphere from outer space at speeds approaching that of light  bombarding atmospheric atoms to produce mesons as well as secondary particles possessing some of the original energy.He was the author or coauthor of seven books  including his autobiography  Moments in the Life of a Scientist (Cambridge Univerity Press  1990)  and more than 100 technical articles. He also was known as an inspiring teacher who numbered among his pupils many leading scientists in universities and industry.During World War II  he made major contributions to the work of the Los Alamos Laboratory  where the atom bomb was developed. Following the war he was active in the work of a committee of scientists that developed new materials for the teaching of high school physics.As a member of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences and other advisory groups  he contributed to the formulation of public policy in the scientific exploration of space. In his space research he led the efforts that resulted in the discovery of cosmic X-rays and was a key participant in pioneering investigations of the interplanetary medium.Professor Claude R. Canizares  director of MIT's Center for Space Research  described Dr. Rossi in a statement as "one of the giants of modern physics and astrophysics."Prior to his arrival at MIT  he made seminal contributions to cosmic ray and elementary particle physics  inventing many of the basic experimental techniques that are still in use in every major laboratory. At MIT  his cosmic ray work continued  but much of his energy was devoted to opening new windows on the universe " Professor Canizares continued."He is rightfully called the grandfather of high energy astrophysics  being largely responsible for starting X-ray astronomy  as well as the study of interplanetary plasma. Each of these is now a rich and exciting enterprise. His textbooks  models of clarity  have been used by generations of physics students. Not least  he was a model of scientific integrity and personal warmth who touched deeply all those privileged to work with and know him. He will be sorely missed."Bruno Benedetto Rossi was born in Venice  Italy  in 1905. He studied at the University of Padova and later at the University of Bologna  from which he received the degree of Doctor of Physics in 1927. Four years later he became a professor of physics at the University of Padova  a position he held until he was dismissed by the Fascists. He left Italy in 1938.After a period in Denmark and England  Dr. Rossi came to the United States in 1939 to work as a research associate at the University of Chicago. The following year he was appointed an associate professor of physics at Cornell University where he stayed until 1943  when he joined the staff of the Los Alamos laboratory. He was appointed a professor of physics at MIT in 1946 and became an Institute Professor  a rank reserved for scholars of special distinction  in 1966. He retired in 1970.Dr. Rossi was a member of many international scientific academies  including the National Academy of Sciences  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Philosophical Society and the Accademia dei Lincei.His honors included the US Medal of Science  the Gold Medal of the Italian Physical Society  the International Feltrinelli Prize of the Accademia dei Lincei  the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal awarded by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia  and the Wolf Prize in Physics.Dr. Rossi began working on cosmic rays in 1929 when only a few scientists were interested in the subject. In that year he invented the first electronic circuit for recording the simultaneous occurrence of three or more electrical pulses. This circuit  widely known as the "Rossi coincidence circuit " proved not only to be one of the fundamental electronic devices for experimental high energy nuclear physics  but also to be a basic element of modern computers.In 1958 Dr. Rossi focused attention on the potential value of direct measurements by space probes of the ionized interplanetary gas. He and his collaborators developed a new detector for such measurements  and in an experiment conducted aboard the Explorer X satellite in 1961 they discovered the magnetopause  the boundary of the region of space dominated by the earth's far magnetic field.In 1960 Dr. Rossi initiated an exploratory search for cosmic X-rays. This led to the discovery in 1962 of the great Scorpio X-ray source  the first nonsolar source of cosmic x-rays to be observed.Dr. Rossi leaves his wife  Nora (Lombroso) of Cambridge; three children  Florence Moloney of Sunnyvale  Calif.  Frank Rossi of Boston  and Linda Rossi of New York City; and two grandchildren  Nina Yager of Austin  Tex.  and Thomas Moloney of Sunnyvale.A scholarship fund in his memory is being established in the Department of Physics at MIT.A version of this

Crawford Greenewalt of DuPont Dies,Crawford H. Greenewalt  a member of the MIT Corporation for more than 40 years and president of the DuPont Company from 1948-1962  died Monday  Sept. 27  in Wilmington  Del.  a day after suffering a massive stroke. He was 91.Mr. Greenewalt  a member of the MIT Class of 1922  became a Life Member of the Corporation in 1951 and Life Member  emeritus  in 1977. He served on many Visiting Committees and on the Corporation  Development Committee (1968-80)  the Investment Committee (1963-65)  the Membership Committee (1963-68) and on the Presidential Search Committee (1964-65) which nominated Howard W. Johnson to serve as president of MIT.Mr. Johnson  MIT president from 1966-1971 and later chairman of the Corporation until 1983   said of Mr. Greenewalt:"Crawford Greenewalt was a rare individual-one of the leading chief executives of his time-who was also a fine scientist and a discerning humanist. As head of the DuPont Company in the many years following the war  he did much to build its basic research strength  making the company one of the strongest science-based companies in the world. As a photographer and ornithologist of note  his original work on bird flight and bird song is still seen as fundamental. As a president of the American Philosophical Society  he did much to strengthen dialog and understanding among scientists and public affairs leaders. At MIT he was a great contributing member of the Corporation and we shall miss him deeply."Dr. Paul E. Gray  chairman of the MIT Corporation  said MIT "continues to benefit from actions taken and policies established during Mr. Greenewalt's years of active participation in the governance of the Institute. His interest continued to be strong even in those years when he no longer regularly came to Cambridge and his support and counsel could always be counted on to strengthen MIT activities taking place in his area."Mr. Greenewalt was born Aug. 16  1902  in Cummington  Mass.  and received the SB in chemical engineering from MIT in 1922.He began his career as a chemist and worked in four manufacturing and two auxiliary departments of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. and later served as a vice president  a director and president from 1948-62. He served as board chairman from 1962-67.Mr. Greenewalt's played major roles in the development of nylon and in the birth of DuPont's atomic energy program. His widely varied interests included birds and high-speed photography-he was a close friend of the late MIT Professor Harold E. "Doc" Edgerton  developer of the strobe light  who pioneered high-speed photography. Mr. Greenewalt combined those interests in the book Hummingbirds  published in 1960. It contained 70 high-speed photos of hummingbirds and a text  documenting how the tiny birds fly and maneuver. In 1968 he published another book on the subject  Bird Song: Acoustics and Physiology.He also wrote many articles on business management and the economy that appeared in publications like Readers' Digest  Fortune  Saturday Review and leading newspapers.Mr. Greenewalt's wife  the late Margaretta Lammot du Pont  died in 1991. He is survived by his three children.A memorial service will be held September 30 in Christ Church  Wilmington  Del. A private burial service was scheduled for Wednesday  September 29.A version of this

Pilot  Corporator James H. Doolittle Dies,Retired Lt. General James H. Doolittle-MIT alumnus  Life Member Emeritus of the MIT Corporation  a pioneer in the science of aviation and a record-setting pilot who led the first World War II bombing raid on Japan-died Monday (Sept. 27) at the age of 96.Gen. Doolittle died at his son's home in Pebble Beach  CA. He had suffered a stroke earlier in the month.His career included a period away from the military as vice president and director of Shell Oil Company. But even as a businessman he worked to improve airplanes and flying techniques."His great achievements in peace and war will always be remembered by a grateful nation " said Howard W. Johnson  former chairman of the MIT Corporation. "But we at MIT are equally in debt to General Doolittle for his diligent service to the Institute. We have benefited hugely from his leadership  generosity and counsel. As we told him in a birthday tribute just two years ago  he may have been a native son of California  but he was truly an adopted son of MIT."Once when he was asked to sum up his philosophy  he said it was simply a matter of trying to leave the earth a better place than he found it. He certainly did that  and he did it with grace and good humor. The Doolittle grin was almost as famous as his flying exploits. While we are deeply saddened  we are grateful for his valuable service to MIT and for the immense pleasure of knowing him as a friend."Gen. Doolittle first came to MIT in the fall of 1923 as an Army lieutenant  under a special program  to study advanced aeronautical engineering  the first such university course in the country. When he received the Master of Science and Doctor of Aeronautical Engineering degrees in June of 1925  there were not 100 men in the world who held comparable advanced degrees.His doctoral dissertation  "Wind Velocity Gradient and Its Effect on Flying Characteristics " disproved the popular theory held by many pilots of the day that they could tell wind direction  and the level of the plane by instinct even when they could not see the ground or the horizon. Applying classroom theory to test flights in the worst possible weather  he determined that there was no accurate way for a pilot to know how the wind was blowing or the attitude of the plane unless he had visual aids or instruments.These were believed to be the first studies in aeronautics to combine directly data from the university laboratory with data from the flights of a test pilot.The accomplishment was one of his many pioneering feats  among them blind flying. He was the first person to take off  fly and land an airplane entirely by instruments.For his research accomplishments at MIT  the Army  which at that time was responsible for military flying  awarded Doolittle an Oak Leaf Cluster to add to the Distinguished Flying Cross he already had received. By the end of his career in the US Air Force  he would hold the Medal of Honor  the nation's highest military award  for the Tokyo raid.His studies at MIT marked the beginning of a lifelong association with the Institute. He was appointed to the MIT Corporation as an Alumni Term Member in 1953  was made Life Member in 1958 and Life Member Emeritus in 1967.He returned to MIT many times and  served on several visiting committees.These included Aeronautics and Astronautics from 1948 to 1957 and again from 1962 to 1967; Chemical Engineering from 1953 to 1954; Civil Engineering from 1961 to 1965; Mechanical Engineering from 1957 to 1958; Membership from 1959 to 1961  and Sponsored Research from 1957 to 1962. He was chairman of three of those committees and he also was a member of the Charles Stark  Draper Professorship Sponsoring Committee.Gen. Doolittle was born in Alameda  CA.  in 1896. He enrolled in the University of California School of Mines with the intention of becoming a mining engineer  but left in his senior year when the United States entered the first World War.Even then interested in flying  he reported to the School of Military Aeronautics at the University of California and soloed after only six hours of instruction.It was the beginning of a career in flying that would include a succession of aviation records  including a coast-to-coast flight in 1922 in less than 24 hours. It culminated with the raid over Tokyo on April 18  1942  by 16 B-25 bombers that flew off the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet. While the raid did not inflict major damage  it put the Japanese on notice that their cities were in reach of US air power.His legendary career has been described in the book  The Amazing Mr. Doolittle  by Quentin Reynolds. The movie  "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo " told the story of the famous raid.In later years  Gen. Doolittle had made his home in Santa Monica  CA.  with his late wife  Josephine. His two sons  the late James H. Doolittle  Jr.  and John P. Doolittle  who survives him  were both Air Force officers.A version of this

Theodore Wood memorial August 28,Memorial services will be held on Chebeague Island  ME  on Saturday  Aug. 28  for Theodore Wood  Jr.  of Winchester  professor emeritus of literature and American studies in the Literature Section.Those who want to attend may call Professor Wood's wife  Marcia  at (617) 729-4976.Professor Wood  who taught at MIT for more than 45 years  died of cancer August 7 at the New England Medical Center. He was 79.Professor Wood  who specialized in American literature  culture and folklore  was also well-known as a guitarist and folksinger who performed for groups in the Boston area. He also appeared regularly as a performer and interviewer on Dateline Boston  a locally produced television program  and he both produced and performed on televised courses broadcast by Channel 5 and by WGBH-TV (Channel 2)  the Public Broadcasting System station in Boston.It was to his teaching and his students  however  that he was primarily devoted. He spent his entire career at MIT and he was known as a student's teacher who spent much time outside classes with his students.He was perhaps best known for his courses on the writer and humorist Mark Twain  but he was an authority on the full range of 20th century American literature  covering such authors as Faulkner  Hemingway and Fitzgerald.He also was a scholar of American poetry and one of his teaching assignments was the subject  "The Nature of Poetry " which aimed to stimulate understanding and appreciation of the essentials of poetry.Professor emeritus Richard M. Douglas  one of his colleagues in the Department of Humanities  said that Professor Wood's lifetime interest in Americana was perhaps best exemplified by the fact that he crossed the country six times by car early in his career.Professor Douglas also recalled his friend's "remarkable baritone voice" and his passion for sailing  particularly in Casco Bay. Professor Wood spent some 60 summers on Chebeague Island in the bay  having gone there the first time with his family at the age of 13.Professor Wood was born in Medford and was educated in private schools in Westchester County  New York. He received his bachelor's degree in English literature from Harvard University in 1935 and master's degree from Harvard in 1940.He came to MIT as a part-time instructor in 1941 before serving three years in the Army Air Corps in World War II as a weather observer. He returned to MIT in 1945  and became assistant professor in 1952 and professor in 1972. He retired in 1979 but returned to the Institute a year later to teach for an additional two years.Then  for 10 years  through last year  he taught Lifetime Learning Courses in Wellesley and Newton as a participant in the Retired Scholars Volunteer Program.Besides his wife  Marcia (Barrows) Wood of Winchester  Professor Wood leaves a daughter  Laurie Wood McDonough of Kennebunk  ME; three stepchildren  Nancy M. Emery of Fall River  Clifton W. Emery of III of Westford and Peter B.

Professor Emeritus H.H. Uhlig dies at 86,Dr. Herbert Henry Uhlig  professor emeritus of metallurgy at MIT and a pioneering researcher into the corrosion of metals  died at his home in Hancock  N.H  on July 3  at the age of 86.His family said he had been in failing health.Dr. Uhlig was born on March 3  1907  in Haledon  NJ. He received the ScB degree in 1929 from Brown University  and a PhD in 1932 from MIT. He was a research chemist at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City  and later an assistant chief chemist at Lever Brothers in Cambridge  Mass. He next became a research associate at MIT until 1940  but when the pressure of World War II limited the financial support of academic programs he transferred his corrosion investigations to the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady  NY.In 1946  he returned to MIT as associate professor and director of the re-established Corrosion Laboratory. In 1953 he was promoted to full professor within the Department of Metallurgy (now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering). He continued his teaching and research at MIT until his retirement in 1972. He participated in part-time teaching and research at MIT until 1975  when he accepted visiting professorships in Australia; Woods Hole  Mass.; and Eindhoven  the Netherlands.Professor Uhlig co-authored nearly 200 scientific and technical papers dealing with corrosion  which is the degradation of metals as the result of environmental conditions  rust being the most notable example. He edited the Corrosion Handbook  published in 1948 by John Wiley and Sons. In 1963 his book Corrosion and Corrosion Control  was published by John Wiley and Sons. In 1985 the third edition was published which he had edited with a former student  R. Winston Revie.He was a member of The Electrochemical Society and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE). He participated and helped to organize many conferences during his lifetime including: The Gordon Research Conference on Corrosion  International Corrosion Council  and the International Symposium on Passivity.In 1982 the Greater Boston Section of NACE established the "H.H. Uhlig Student Grant " which is awarded annually in recognition of outstanding scholarship. In 1985 The Electrochemical Society named an award in his honor  "H.H. Uhlig Award of the Corrosion Division " which is granted for recognition of contributions to corrosion science.His many honors and awards included the Willis Rodney Whitney Award  Guggenheim Fellowship  Palladium Medal and U.R. Evans Award. He was an Honorary Fellow of the British Institution of Corrosion Science and Technology. The Electrochemical Society Symposium in 1981 was dedicated in honor of Professor Uhlig on his 75th birthday. A symposium volume was published entitled  Corrosion and Corrosion Protection.In May 1982 the Corrosion Laboratory at MIT was dedicated in his honor and renamed as "The H.H. Uhlig Corrosion Laboratory." At the dedication banquet  Professor Uhlig cited the importance of corrosion research in the past and its continued importance for the future in order to conserve and use wisely our limited natural resources. He remarked that "MIT through its established tradition of advancing and disseminating corrosion knowledge provides additional support to its overall program contributing to an improved world...it has been my inner conviction that this assignment is a genuine privilege and an unusual opportunity."During his retirement years  Professor Uhlig enjoyed the Hancock area's cultural advantages: the Monadnock Chorus  Apple Hill Chamber Group  and the nearby Sharon Art Center. He had been an enthusiastic outdoors man all of his life participating in hiking (especially Mount Monadnock) swimming  canoeing  skiing  skating  and many other outdoor activities. He was a member of the Appalachian Mountain club for many years.He is survived by his wife  Greta  of Hancock  NH  their children  Karin of Wellesley  Maida of Brookline  and Kristin of Gorham  ME; and grandchildren.A version of this

During World War II he served on the War Production Board.In the course of his research at MIT  Dr. Shrock discovered many new species of fossils  and several other fossils were named in his honor.From 1949 to 1965 he was head of the Department of Geology and Geophysics. Besides the accomplishments in geology during this period  he started a program of instruction and research in oceanography administered jointly by the department and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. When MIT's first oceanographic research vessel was acquired from the Navy it was named the R.R. Shrock in recognition of his leadership in the field.Professor Thomas H. Jordan  head of the Department of Earth  Atmospheric  and Planetary Sciences  said Dr. Shrock had served as a mentor for members of the department. "He contributed in so many different ways to the department " Dr. Jordan said. "He just loved this place."One of the summer training programs for undergraduates inaugurated during Dr. Shrock's term as department head  was the GSI Student Cooperative Plan  under which students took summer field training with Geophysical Service  Inc.  a Texas geophysical exploration company founded by an MIT alumnus  Dr. Cecil H. Green.Mr. Green and his wife  Ida  later provided funds for the 20-story Cecil and Ida Green Center for the Earth Sciences  dedicated in 1964. The Greens  among MIT's greatest benefactors  also endowed three professorships in the current Department of Earth  Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences  one known as the Robert R. Shrock Professorship of Earth and Planetary Sciences.Besides his articles in research journals  Dr. Shrock was the author or co-author of several well-known books  including Index Fossils of North America (with Hervey W. Shimer)  Sequence in Layered Rocks and Principles of Invertebrate Paleontology (with W. H. Twenhofel).In addition to the fossils named for him  Dr. Shrock received many awards and honors. He was Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  President of the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists (SEPM)  and President of the American Association of Geology Teachers. He also received an honorary degree from Indiana University and the Twenhofel Medal fro  SEPM.He served as a corporation member  trustee and executive committee member of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. He also was a member of many professional geological societies and served on numerous review and visiting committees.After his retirement  Dr. Shrock wrote two books on the history of geology: The Geologists Crosby of Boston and the two-volume work  Geology at MIT: 1865-1965. His great energy and enthusiasm even toward the end of his life were further evidenced by his completion  at the age of 85  of the biography Cecil and Ida Green: Philanthropists Extraordinary.Dr. Shrock is survived by his wife  Theodora Weidman Shrock of Lexington; a daughter  Wendolyn T. Shrock of Northfield; a son  Robert E. Shrock of Setauket  NY; and by his sisters  Miriam Rody and Virginia Shrock of Kokomo  IN; Evelyn Lavrenz of Plainfield  IN  Dorothea Littler of Syracuse  IN  and Cleta Berry of Collierville  TN.A version of this

Leo J. Neuringer dies,Leo J. Neuringer of Wellesley  Mass.  a physicist at MIT who pioneered the development of imaging and spectroscopic technology for medical and other purposes  died Tuesday (May 4) at Brigham and Women's Hospital  Boston  of cancer. He was 65.Dr. Neuringer had been a staff member at MIT's Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory since 1963. His early research was focused on the fundamental properties of semiconductors and superconductors in intense magnetic fields at low temperatures.In 1974 he founded the High Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Resource at the laboratory under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of Health  serving as its director until 1989. He also was founder and director of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility at MIT from 1982 to 1989.From 1989 until his retirement last month  he served as program director of a large research effort in the development of high magnetic field instrumentation for whole body imaging of humans. The facility  officially known as the NIH Comprehensive NMR Center for Biomedical Research  is used by the Boston area medical community for basic research on human biology and disease.Under Dr. Neuringer's direction  the nuclear magnetic resonance facilities at the Magnet Laboratory and MIT contributed significant and new applications of NMR to research in the structure and functions of molecules and cells and in cardiac surgery  brain disease in children  diabetes  and cancer.Although not a faculty member  Dr. Neuringer was a superb teacher  said Dr. David Holtzman  a neurologist at Children's Hospital who studied and collaborated with Dr. Neuringer as a visiting scientist at the Magnet Lab."There are people in almost all basic magnetic resonance imaging fields who at one time or another worked with him " Dr. Holtzman said. "He engendered excitement and dedication in his students." The students largely came from Harvard Medical School  the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and the MIT Department of Nuclear Engineering.Dr. Holtzman said his colleague's dedication to science was eclipsed only by his devotion to his wife and children  and that Dr. Neuringer thought of his students virtually as extended members of his family. "There probably wasn't anybody who hadn't been out to his house a few times " he said.Of the many research papers authored by Dr. Neuringer and his students  Dr. Holtzman noted  practically all list the student author first.Dr. Neuringer broadly expanded the medical applications of MRI  Dr. Holtzman said  by pushing himself and his students to ask: "What questions can we ask with this technology?"Dr. Neuringer was born in New York City in 1928. He received a BS in physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1951 and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957.Before coming to MIT  he was a physicist with the National Bureau of Standards in Washington  D.C.  a scientist with the Raytheon Company and a physics instructor at Tufts University.He was a senior scientist at MIT and a member of the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory steering committee.He was a visiting professor at several universities  including Tufts  Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the University of Chile.He was the author or co-author of some 90 articles in professional journals  and he was a Fellow of the American Physical Society.His survivors include his wife  Adele (Friedman) Neuringer of Wellesley; his children  Larry Neuringer of Rye  N.Y.  Dr. Julia Neuringer-Cohen of Brookline  Mass.  and Dr. Isabel Neuringer of Brookline; his sister  Frances Yarmush of Brooklyn  N.Y.; his brother  Irv Neuringer of Bethlehem  N.H.; and a grandchild  Dale Neuringer of Rye  N.Y.The funeral service was Thursday  May 6  at Congregation Beth El-Atereth Israel in Newton. He was a member there and also of Temple Reyim in Newton. Interment was at Linwood Memorial Park in Randolph  Mass.Donations in his name may be made to a charity of one's choice.A version of this

Professor Bernard Feld dies at 73,Dr. Bernard T. Feld  an emeritus professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped usher in the atomic era as an assistant to Enrico Fermi and then became a leading voice for nuclear disarmament for nearly half a century  died Friday (Feb. 19) at his home in Brooklyn  N.Y.  of lymphoma. He was 73.A memorial service will be held Monday  March 31  at 1:30pm in the MIT Chapel.He leaves his wife  Ellen Banks Feld of Brooklyn; two daughters from a previous marriage  Ellen Feld of Philadelphia and Elizabeth Feld of Kauai  Hawaii; a grandson  John Bradmiller-Feld of Philadelphia; and three brothers  Maury of Cambridge  Marvin of Tuscon  Ariz.  and Myron of Los Angeles. He was divorced from his first wife  the former Eliza McCormick.Dr. Feld was a graduate student and teaching assistant to physicists Fermi and Isador I. Rabi at Columbia University when he was given the opportunity to assist Fermi and physicist Leo Szilard in their efforts to produce a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.In 1941 he suspended his graduate studies to join Fermi and Szilard at the University of Chicago  where the first controlled nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the Metallurgical Laboratory on December 2  1942.In 1943  Dr. Feld left Chicago for Oak Ridge  Tennessee  to participate in the effort  through the Manhattan Project  to develop an atomic bomb. From Oak Ridge he went to the Los Alamos Laboratory at the University of California  where he contributed to the development of the experimental plutonium bomb later detonated in the desert at Alamagordo  NM.Dr. Feld  who was born in Brooklyn  had entered the City College of New York was he was 15 and received a bachelor of science degree in 1939.  After World War II  he returned to Columbia University to receive his PhD in 1945.He was appointed an instructor in physics at MIT in 1946  but before taking up his duties he spent six months in Washington  D.C.  where he and other leading physicists were lobbying against military control of nuclear research and weapons development. The result was legislation setting up the civilian Atomic Energy Agency. It was the beginning of a lifelong commitment to peaceful uses of atomic power and to ending the threat of nuclear war.In a talk before a New Hampshire group in 1981  he said:"Nuclear weapons aren't good for anything and it's up to all of us to get this message across and reverse the current trends. To me  the use of a nuclear weapon is not only irrational  it's immoral."Having been involved in the original sin  I've spent the rest of my life trying to atone for it."One of those closest to him at MIT  Institute Professor Emeritus Herman Feshbach  said  "We all owe a debt of gratitude to Bernie for his life-long dedication to the nuclear disarmament movement."Dr. Feshbach noted that his colleague was an outstanding physicist.Dr. Feld was promoted to assistant professor at MIT in 1948  associate professor in 1952 and professor in 1955. He served as  director of the Laboratory for Nuclear Scienc e from 1975 to 1980. He retired in 1990.His research focused on experimental and theoretical research in high-energy physics  particularly interactions among the fundamental particles. Among his significant scientific efforts was his contribution to the development of the Cambridge Electron Accelerator  jointly owned and operated by MIT and Harvard University.Outside of MIT  Dr. Feld was at various times a Guggenheim Fellow and visiting professor at the University of Rome; a Ford Foundation Fellow and visiting scientist at the European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva  Switzerland; visiting professor at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris; research associate at the Centre de Recherche Nucleaire  Saclay  France; and visiting professor of theoretical physics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London.Dr. Feld published extensively in professional journals and wrote the book  Neutron Physics (1954) and Models of Elementary Particles (1969). as well as an extensive review article  "Neutron Physics." He also was a founding and associate editor for many years of Annals of Physics  an MIT-based journal presenting original work in all areas of basic physics research. In addition  he served 10 years as  Consulting Science Editor for Blaisdell Publishing Company  a division of Random House  Inc.  helping to develop a series of college-level physics textbooks.His extensive study of arms control and disarmament  and his activities supporting the movement  took him throughout the world. He was vice-president of the Federation of American Scientists  one of the first groups dedicated to controlling nuclear weapons  president of the Council for a Liveable World and the Albert Einstein Peace Foundation  a member of the editorial board of the journal Disarmament and Arms Control  and editor of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The Bulletin printed the "doomsday clock " a symbolic representation of how close the world was  in the magazine's opinion  to nuclear war.Dr. Feld also became deeply involved in the international "Pugwash" Conferences on Science and World Affairs  serving two-years as secretary-general of the conferences.He was a prolific writer of essays  letters to newspapers and magazine articles  criticizing governments for not doing more to reduce nuclear stockpiles. He was especially proud  according to colleagues  to be on President Richard Nixon's "enemies list." He also assailed the arms buildup under President Ronald Reagan and was particularly critical of the "star wars" project to build an anti-ballistic missile shield.He was co-director of MIT's Program on Science and Technology for International Security and he co-edited two books addressing the issue of disarmament: Impact of New Technologies on the Arms Race (with T. Greenwood  G.W. Rathjens and S. Weinberg  1971) and The Future of the Sea-Based. Deterrent (with K. Tsipis and A.H. Cahn  1973). He also published a collection of his papers  A Voice Crying in the Wilderness: Essays on Science and World Affairs  1979).Dr. Feld was a Fellow of the American Physical Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His honors include the Leo Szilard Award for Physics in the Public Interest from the American Physical Society.A version of this

Professor Phyllis A. Wallace dies,Dr. Phyllis A. Wallace  professor emerita of management at the Sloan School of Management and a labor economist who pioneered the study of sexual and racial discrimination in the workplace  died during the weekend of natural causes at her apartment in Boston. She was 69.Professor Wallace spearheaded  through her scholarship  a precedent-setting legal decision in a federal case that reversed sex and race discrimination in American industry. She directed studies for a federal lawsuit against American Telephone and Telegraph Co.  then the largest private employer in the United States. The suit led to a 1973 decision that the company had discriminated against women and minority men. The company agreed to pay millions in back wages and to make other pay adjustments. The verdict also brought about changes in transfer and promotion policies and recruitment criteria.The case  which Professor Wallace wrote about in her book  Equal Employment Opportunity and the AT&T Case (MIT Press  1976)  was an extension of her own life  background and interests. She continued to work in these areas after her retirement and only recently had agreed to spend the next six months helping Sloan School Dean Lester C. Thurow improve the school's response to sexual harassment problems. She also had begun work on encouraging minorities in the participation of activities at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.In a letter to the Sloan faculty on her death  Dean Thurow said that  as a labor economist  Professor Wallace "widened all our knowledge." Her study of Sloan School women graduates "made everyone wiser about the issues of women attempting to advance in the business world " he said.Professor Wallace was born in Baltimore  MD. She received a BA degree in 1943 from New York University  an MA from Yale in 1944 and her PhD from Yale in 1948.After receiving her PhD  she joined the National Bureau of Economic Research as an economist/statistician  while also teaching part-time at the College of the City of New York.She served on the faculty of Atlanta University from 1953 to 1957  when she became a senior economist for the US government specializing in Soviet economic studies. She was chief of technical studies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Office of Research from 1966 to 1969 and vice president of research for the Metropolitan Applied Research Center from 1969 to 1972.After serving as a visiting professor at the Sloan School  in 1975 she became the first woman to hold the rank of professor at the school.When Mount Holyoke College conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Professor Wallace in 1983  the citation said that as an educator  public servant and scholar "your career has taken you from the university to government to the corporate boardroom."It continued: "Beginning your career at a time when neither blacks nor women had a fair chance  you have seen great progress toward equal employment opportunity-progress due in no small measure to your scholarship on the economics of discrimination in the labor market."When she retired in 1986  scholars in industrial and labor relations and economics from around the world gathered at MIT for a conference in her honor. In addition  the Sloan School endowed the Phyllis A. Wallace Doctoral Fellows Fund  which provides support for blacks admitted to the school's doctoral program  and the Phyllis A. Wallace Visiting Scholars Fund to provide support for black visiting scholars at the school.In addition to her many awards and honors  she served on numerous national advisory committees and corporate boards.Her books included Women  Minorities and Employment Discrimination (1977)  Pathways to Work: Employment Among Black Teenage Females (1974)  and Black Women in the Labor Force (1980).Survivors include her mother  Stevella Wallace; a brother  Samuel Wallace; three sisters  Lydia Mills  Ophelia Wallace and Margaret Campbell; and a niece  Carolyn Mills. All reside in Baltimore.Funeral services will be held Friday  January 15  at 7:30pm in Metropolitan United Methodist Church  Baltimore  MD. Burial will take place Saturday. Contributions can be made in her memory to the Friends of the Nubian Art Gallery of the Boston Buseum of Fine Arts.A version of this

Professor J. Harvey Evans Dies at 78,J. Harvey Evans  a professor emeritus of naval architecture at MIT who was widely known for his expertise in the structure of ships  died of a heart condition Monday  Nov. 23  at Mid-Coast Hospital in Brunswick  ME  at the age of 78.Professor Evans and his wife  Edith  lived in Lexington for nearly 40 years before moving to a retirement community in Brunswick a year ago.Professor Evans was a specialist in ship structure  computer-aided design of marine vessels  and the structure of vehicles designed to operate at great depths.He is credited with being the first to propose a "gross-panel" model for hull girder analysis  instead of the traditional model that considered a ship's structure section by section. He also was an early advocate of reviewing hull girder stiffness criteria and for the collection of fabrication data from which tolerance standards might be derived on a statistical basis.More recently he had been involved with the design and development of a 925-foot post-tensioned reinforced concrete ship for transporting liquified natural gas at temperatures of 260 degrees below zero. The ship has not been built.Professor Evans once told an interviewer that a naval architect's primary concern is the seaworthiness of a ship  but he said that the term "naval architect" was something of a misnomer. "It involves much more than merely `naval' ships and is really engineering rather than architecture " he explained. "It involves math and the basic sciences and is primarily concerned with the function of the vessel as opposed to aesthetic considerations."Professor Evans  born in Rochester  NY  in 1914  returned to the land of his parents to receive a bachelor's degree in engineering from Liverpool University in England  known the world over for its shipbuilding courses  in 1937. Drawn to the sea  he was prevented by poor eyesight from attending the Naval Academy.For the next 10 years he was employed in the Ship Building Division of the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy  MA  where he supervised the development of final lines  form calculations  damage control  general design and launching analyses.He joined the MIT faculty in 1947 as an assistant professor  became associate professor in 1952 and full professor in 1961. He retired to emeritus status in 1978  but continued to work in his profession.Professor Evans was a member of many professional and honor societies. He was general chairman of the International Ship Structure Congress in 1976  and he served as vice president of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers from 1978 to 1980. The society awarded him its Davidson Medal in 1976 for "outstanding scientific accomplishments in ship research" and the society's US Interagency Ship Structure Committee honored him in 1984 for "exceptional service to the maritime industry."Other awards and honors included an official commendation from Seoul National University in South Korea for services rendered in a technical and educational advisory capacity in 1957  and a citation from the Coast Guard for "having advanced the state-of-the-art in ship structural design and increased the safety and reliability of vessels of all types."Professor Evans also served as a consultant to many engineering and naval architecture firms  including the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat Division  Arthur D. Little  Inc.  Litton Systems  and the governments of the United States and Canada.He was the author of many papers on general ship and structural design  and he was the editor and principal author of the book Ship Structural Design Concepts (Cornell Maritime Press  1975) and of the companion volume Ship Structural Design Concepts  Second Cycle (Cornell Maritime Press  1983). He also was the senior author of Ocean Engineering Structures (MIT Press  1969).His hobbies included photography  music  mountain climbing and modern history. He was a trained tenor soloist.In addition to his wife of 49 years  Edith (Price)  he leaves a son  H. David Evans of Anchorage  Alaska; a daughter  Dr. Gail E.H. Evans of Ames  Iowa; and a brother  Frank H. Evans of Lynnfield.A version of this

Professor R.O. Preusser Dies,A memorial service in celebration of the life of retired Professor Robert Ormerod Preusser  who died November 16 of cancer  will be held in the MIT Chapel on February 8 at 2pm. A reception in the Faculty Club will follow.Mr. Preusser  professor emeritus of visual design in the School of Architecture and Planning  was 73.Professor Preusser developed the first studio course at MIT for non-artists  encouraging students to use their scientific and technological studies to create two- and three-dimensional visual forms. A team of his students created the first Fortune 500 magazine cover to employ computer-generated design. In 1969  he taught a similar studio course at the Institute for Educational Technology at the University of Surrey in Guildford  England.From 1974 until his retirement in 1985  Professor Preusser was director of education at MIT's Center for Advanced Visual Studies.Professor Preusser was born in Houston  TX  where he began art lessons with McNeill Davidson in 1930. Between 1939 and 1947  he attended the Institute of Design in Chicago  where he did his first teaching at art classes for children; Tulane University  and the Art Center School in Los Angeles. In his early teens he began exhibiting nationally and internationally.During World War II  from 1942 to 1945  he served as a camouflage technician with the Army's 84th Engineer Camouflage Battalion in North Africa  France  Italy and Germany.Professor Preusser was a co-founder of the Contemporary Arts Association in Houston in 1948  and later co-director of the Contemporary Arts Museum.In 1950 Edith Halpert selected him as one of five promising young painters for the Newcomers Gallery in her New York Downtown Gallery. In addition  Art in America Review nominated him as a "Promising New Talent in USA" in 1956.When Mr. Preusser moved to Cambridge in 1954 to teach at MIT  he had been art editor of the Texas Cancer Bulletin  stage set designer for Houston's Texas Stage  associate curator of education at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and art instructor at the University of Houston.He was invited to MIT by his former teacher  Gyorgy Kepes  now Institute Professor Emeritus. A one-year appointment led to tenure and a 31-year teaching career at the Institute.Professor Preusser's paintings were closely allied with his teaching philosophy of experimentation and innovation. Two exhibits of his works were held in Houston in 1990 and  in 1991  he was honored with a retrospective exhibition of his paintings in the MIT Museum.His works are included in some 200 private and museum collections  as well as in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington  DC.Art critic Elizabeth McBride  commenting on the Houston exhibitions  said that "in any one piece what is most noticeable is the process of internal transformation. There's a concrete quality to his abstractions and a spiritual quality to all his representation... Within this wonderland of experimentation  Preusser manages to remain true to an entirely personal world  for over the years his painting has maintained a serene stability."He leaves his wife  Mary Ellen (Cadenhead); a son  Eric O. Preusser of Boston; a daughter  Alison G. Perroni of Billerica; a daughter-in-law  Diane K. Preusser; a son-in-law  Joseph J. Perroni  and a granddaughter.Donations may be made in his memory to the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital or Hospice of Cambridge.A version of this

Professor Truman Gray Dies,Dr. Truman S. Gray  professor emeritus of engineering electronics and a pioneer in the field of electronic instrumentation  measurement and control  died Saturday  Nov. 7  at Mt. Auburn Hospital. He had suffered a heart attack a few days earlier in his home in Lexington. He was 86.Services were held Tuesday  Nov. 10  at the Church of Our Redeemer  Lexington.Professor Gray  a Lexington resident for 57 years  leaves his wife  Isabel Crockford Gray; a sister  Margaret Shepherd of Texas  and two nieces.Professor Gray began his teaching career at MIT 65 years ago in 1927 as a research assistant in electrical engineering and became a vital force in what is now the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He regularly used his MIT office up to the time of his death.Professor Gray's family moved from Indiana to Austin  TX  shortly after his birth in 1906. His father was a professor at the University of Texas  where Professor Gray received bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and physics in 1926 and 1927  respectively. At MIT  he received a master of science degree in electrical engineering in 1928 and a doctor of science degree in 1930.His doctoral thesis  supervised by the late Vannevar Bush  involved the design and construction of a machine to perform analog numerical integration. Out of this work and from his teaching in this area came a book  Applied Electronics  which became an authoritative text for the field of electronics and was translated into Japanese and Spanish.After serving as a research assistant and instructor in electrical engineering  Dr. Gray joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1935. He was promoted to associate professor in 1942 and professor in 1960.At his retirement in 1971  his graduate-level course  "Electronic Instrumentation and Control " begun in 1934  was the only departmental subject still listed in the catalogue under its original instructor. In addition to teaching the premier departmental subject in electronic instrumentation  which he continued to do even after his official retirement  he also was in charge of the department's Graduate Office for many years.During a leave from MIT in 1947-48  he took charge of designing and developing reactor instrumentation at the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory. He also was an expert witness in numerous legal cases.Professor Gray maintained a special interest in music all his life. He played the clarinet for many years with concert bands  including the Concord Band and the Lexington Bicentennial Band. He especially enjoyed Dixieland and was a founding member in 1957 of the Tabor Hill Dixieland Jazz Band  playing clarinet with the group for the past 35 years. Just last week  he and another band member  Stephen H. Crandall  also an emeritus professor at MIT  were discussing an upcoming engagement. He also was an an accomplished amateur silversmith and glassblower.A version of this

Friedlaender Dies at 54,Professor Ann Fetter Friedlaender  a noted economist who was the first woman academic dean at MIT  died Monday  Oct. 19  at Beth Israel Hospital. Dr. Friedlaender  who had been ill with cancer for several years  was 54 years old.Dr. Friedlaender held dual appointments in two MIT departments as the Class of 1941 Professor of Civil Engineering and Economics. She was an authority in the field of public finance  with a specialty in transportation studies.Dr. Friedlaender also had been the first woman to head an MIT academic department  serving as head of the economics department from January  1983  until her appointment as dean.As the first woman to head one of MIT's five schools  she served as Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science from 1984 to 1990.She was deeply involved in a reassessment of the undergraduate program  playing a leading role in bringing about curriculum changes that strengthened the humanities  arts and social science core requirement for graduation while also establishing a minor in those areas.Her successor  Dean Philip S. Khoury  said that Dr. Friedlaender "contributed enormously to strengthening the profile of the humanities faculty by ensuring many excellent appointments at the junior and senior level and by enhancing the stature and reputation of the humanities within MIT and in the wider academic world.""Under Dean Friedlaender's leadership " he said  "the School of Humanities and Social Science has been a much more active contributor than ever before to the overall educational and research mission of the Institute."MIT Chairman Paul E. Gray  who served as president when Dr. Friedlaender was dean  said: "Professor Friedlaender provided distinguished leadership of sustained effectiveness to the School of Humanities and Social Science at a time of rapid change. She reorganized the Humanities Department  introduced the Writing Requirement and undertook a comprehensive review  restatement and implementation of Institute requirements in the Humanities  Arts  and Social Sciences. She changed the nature of undergraduate education at MIT and her influence will be felt for years to come by many generations of students. All of us who had the good fortune to work with her have been enriched by her friendship and her supportive  insightful colleagueship. Her death leaves a great emptiness  both personal and institutional."When Dr. Friedlaender stepped down as dean to return to teaching and research in the Department of Economics  the then provost  Professor John M. Deutch  described her as "one of the best deans to have graced MIT in its history " adding  "She is a person of enormous wisdom and her accomplishments for the school have been just as enormous."During her tenure as dean  Dr. Friedlaender took the lead in undergraduate curriculum reform by sponsoring the restructuring and rejuvenation of the Humanities  Arts and Social Science distribution system and its new minor program. She also sponsored the highly successful Burchard Scholars Program for undergraduates who excel both in the humanities  arts and social science and in engineering and science.In her reach across both the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at MIT  she sponsored her school's freshman experimental unit  the Integrated Studies Program  and she helped to establish MIT's first new doctoral program in 15 years  the PhD program in the History and Social Study of Science and Technology.Dr. Friedlaender  a native of Philadelphia  received a BA in economics from Radcliffe College in 1960 and a PhD in economics from MIT in 1964. She was a Fulbright Lecturer in 1964-65 at Svenska Handelshogskolan in Helsinki  Finland. Between 1965 and 1974 she was lecturer  assistant professor and professor in the Department of Economics at Boston College. She was a visiting professor in the MIT Department of Economics in 1972-73 before being appointed professor of economics and civil engineering in 1974.Professor Friedlaender has served on committees and boards of a number of public and professional organizations  among them the American Economic Association  the National Bureau of Economic Research  the National Science Foundation  the Rand Corporation and Conrail.She has been a member of the boards of several professional economics journals and she has written or coauthored seven books and monographs. The most recent include Transport Regulation: Equity  Efficiency and Competition  with Richard Spady (1981); and Government Finance  with John F. Due (7th Edition  Richard D. Irwin  1981).Dr. Friedlaender  a resident of Newton  Mass.  leaves her husband  Stephen  an architect  and two sons  Lucas and Nathaniel.A version of this

Professor R.L. Coble Dies,A memorial service will be held for Professor Emeritus Robert L. Coble on Saturday  Sept. 19  at 11am in the MIT Chapel.Dr. Coble  widely known for his research into the properties of ceramics  died Thursday  August 27  in a drowning accident on the island of Maui in Hawaii  where he lived. He was 64.Dr. Coble's studies on sintering  while at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady  N.Y.  before he came to MIT  led to the development of "Lucalox " a dense aluminum-oxide ceramic used in the sodium-vapor highway lamps that give off an orange glow. Sintering is the process that causes material to become a coherent mass by heating without melting. The new ceramic transmitted light  withstood high temperatures and could be pressed into any shape desired.His research and teaching at MIT focused on physical ceramics and the kinetics of ceramics processes.Dr. Coble was born in Uniontown  Pa.  in 1928. He received a bachelor of science degree at Bethany College in 1950 and a doctor of science degree from MIT in 1955. He worked as a researcher for General Electric until 1960 when he was appointed to the MIT faculty as an assistant professor of ceramics in the Department of Metallurgy  now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. He became associate professor in 1962 and full professor in 1969. He became professor of ceramics  emeritus  on his retirement in 1988.His honors included election to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978.  He was a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society and  a member of the Ceramic Education Council and the National Institute of Ceramic Engineers. He was awarded the Institute's Professional Achievement Award in 1960 and the Raytheon Award for "Outstanding Ceramist of the Year" in 1976.In 1974  he went to Japan as a visiting scientist and lecturer under an appointment by the Japan Society for the promotion of science. He took a year's leave from MIT in 1975-76 to program planning for materials sciences with the United States Energy Research and Development Administration.Dr. Coble leaves his wife  Joan  of Lexington  Mass.; five children who are all Massachusetts residents  David W. of Townsend  Eric R. of Acushnet  Stefan G. of Lexington  Catherine Galdi of Billerica and Janet Diodati of Boxboro; and 10 grandchildren.A version of this

Cyril Stanley Smith Dies at 88,Dr. Cyril Stanley Smith  88  a world renowned metallurgist and historian of metallurgy  died of cancer August 25 at his home in Cambridge.Dr. Smith was a retired faculty member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he taught from 1961 until his retirement in 1969. His three titles there reflected the facets of his rich and varied career in science  technology  history and the arts.He was an Institute Professor Emeritus  a title reserved for only a few whose work transcends the boundaries of traditional departments and disciplines.As professor emeritus of the history of science and technology he was recognized as an authority on the historical relationships between people from the beginning of human history and the materials they came to understand and use. Professor Smith was a pioneer in the application of materials science and engineering to the study of archaeological artifacts.As professor emeritus of metallurgy  he was renowned for his research in physical metallurgy  particularly in areas such as the role of interface energy and topology in the structure of polycrystalline materials and the application of metallography to the study of artifacts.Professor Smith's important contributions to the nature of structure in inorganic matter began with the application of simple topology to the shapes of metal grains and then  bu extension  to all levels of the structural hierarchy. Eventually his work included exploration of the structures  on different scales  underlying patterns in both art and science.Professor Smith was born in Birmingham  England  in 1903. He received the B.Sc. degree in metallurgy from the University of Birmingham in 1924 and the Sc.D. degree from MIT in 1926.From 1927 until 1942 he was a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company  where he received some 20 patents and contributed numerous papers to technical publications. His research was focused on the electrical and thermal conductivity  and the mechanical and magnetic properties of copper alloys.After brief service with the War Metallurgy Committee in Washington  Dr. Smith joined the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos where he directed the preparation of the fissionable metal for the atomic bomb and other materials for nuclear experiments. He received the Presidential Medal for Merit for this work in 1946.He joined the University of Chicago in 1946 where he became the founder and first director of the Institute for the Study of Metals  the first interdisciplinary research organization dealing with materials in the United States. It was  he said  "a natural outgrowth of the close association of metallurgists with chemists and physicists on the Manhattan Project."AT MIT Professor Smith designed his joint appointment in the Departments of Metallurgy and Humanities to "encourage the understanding of human history and human activity through the scientific investigation of the material record of the past." He used the methods of the materials engineer to explore the technologies behind the production of art and archaeological artifacts.The Laboratory for Research on Arhcaeological Materials which Dr. Smith established at MIT in 1967 led to the founding 10 years later of the Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology  a consortium of eight Boston area universities and museums devoted to research and graduate education in this new field.Professor Smith was named by President Truman as one of the original nine members of the general advisory committee to the Atomic Energy Commission. He also served on the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences  the President's Science Advisory Committee and the Smithsonian Council.He was the first chairman of the board of governors of Acta Metallurgica  a leading international journal  and a member of the editorial board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He was also a member of the American delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955.Professor Smith's view that the decorative arts  especially ceramics and metals  led to scientists' understanding of the properties of materials is explained in From Art to Science  (MIT Press  1980). The book was an outgrowth of a 1978 exhibit he arranged for the Smithsonian and MIT.His other books include A History of Metallography: The Development of Ideas on the Structure of Metals to 1890  Sources for the History of the Science of Steel  and A Search for Structure. He was co-editor of a number of translations of classic works and author of some 200 papers for scholarly journalsDr. Smith received the Francis J. Clamer Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1952  the 1961 Pfizer Medal from the History of Science Society and the 1961 Gold Medal of the American Society of Metals. In 1963 he received the Douglas Medal from the AIME  the third time that society had chosen him for an award. He received the Leonard da Vinci Medal from the Society for the History of Technology in 1966  the Platinum Medal of the Institute of Metals in 1970. His memberships included the National Academy of Sciences  the American Philosophical Society  the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  Academie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences  the American Physical Society  the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers  the American Society for Metals the History of Science Society  the Society for the History of Technology  the Iron and Steel Institute  and the Newcomen Society. He was also an honorary member of the Institute of Metals  Akademie der Wissenschaften  the Indian Institute of Metals and the Japan Institute of Metals.In 1991 Professor Smith received the Gemant Award from the American Institute of Physics for "pioneering the use of solid state physics in the study of ancient art and artifacts to reconstruct their cultural  historical and technological significance." The Cyril Stanley Smith Memorial Fund has been established at MIT to foster studies relating ancient and contemporary art and science in the materials field. Memorial gifts may be made to this fund or to Hospice of Cambridge.Professor Smith is survived by his wife of 60 years  Alice Kimball Smith  dean emerita of the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe; a daughter Anne Smith Denman  chair of the Department of Anthropology at Central Washington University  Ellensburg  Wash.; a son  Stuart Marchant Smith  a marine geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla  Calif.; a sister  Mary Smith of Sutton Coldfield  England  and four grandchildren.A memorial service for Professor Smith will be held at MIT in the fall.A version of this

Professor M.B. Bever Dies,Michael Berliner Bever  a retired professor of materials science and engineering and a founder of the scientific study of recycling  died July 17 of cancer in his Cambridge home. He was 80. Professor Bever taught at MIT for more than 50 years.Born in Berlin  Germany  Professor Bever earned a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from Heidelberg University in 1934. He then emigrated to the United States and received an MBA from Harvard University in 1937. After a brief period in business  he attended MIT  earning a Doctor of Science degree in metallurgy in 1944.An outstanding metallurgist  Professor Bever pioneered the application of thermodynamics to the mechanical properties of metals. He was also a leader in the use of calorimetric techniques to explore the energetics of the ordering of atoms in crystalline structures. During this period  he became one of the first practitioners of the emerging field of materials science and engineering.In the early 1970s  Professor Bever became interested in conservation and recycling  particularly the environmental and economic aspects of the production and consumption of materials. Drawing on his backgrounds in law  management and metallurgy  he developed an integrated scientific approach to recycling. He received an award from the National Association of Secondary Materials Industries in 1972 in recognition of creating the first course in the country  if not the world  on the economics and materials aspects of recycling.He was the author of more than 150 scientific papers  and an editor of several books. He served on numerous national panels and consulting bodies. His culminating contribution was as Editor-in-Chief of the innovative and comprehensive eight-volume Encyclopedia of Materials Science and Engineering  published by Pergamon Press in 1986. Three weeks before his death he completed editing the Concise Encyclopedia of Materials Economics  Policy and Management  one of several supplementary volumes that followed the original eight-volume work.Professor Bever taught at MIT for more than 50 years  during which he supervised more than 40 graduate-level dissertations and was an influential teacher of many active scientists."Michael Bever taught more than the skills of science " said a former student  Dr. Praveen Chaudhari  an IBM researcher. "His background in law and management  his keen interest in music and literature and his strong sense of human values and the dignity of man shaped his interaction with students."Another former student  Jerome B. Cohen  dean of the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University  said: "Michael Bever was truly a teacher's teacher. He has made us see the responsibility we had to keep on learning new things and to communicate well what we learned."Professor Bever was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Association for the Advancement of Science  and the American Society for Materials; a member of numerous professional organizations; an overseer of the Boston Museum of Science  and a member of the Harvard Musical Association.He leaves his wife  Marion (Gordon) Bever of Cambridge; two sons  James of Cambridge and Thomas of Rochester  N.Y.; a daughter  Ivers Bever of Cambridge; a brother  Christopher of Chevy Chase  Md.; and five grandchildren; a sixth grandchild  Michael Gordon Bever  died before him.A private family funeral was held on Monday  July 20.

Designer Jacqueline Casey Dies at 65,Jacqueline S. Casey  a graphic designer internationally recognized for her "elegant posters" for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  died Monday  May 18  at her home in Brookline after a long struggle with cancer.An exhibit of her work  " MIT/Casey  Jacqueline S. Casey A retrospective: MIT's graphic design in evolution " is currently being shown at the Compton Gallery at MIT. The exhibit opened April 25 and continues through September.Ms. Casey joined MIT in 1955 and was assigned to produce summer session materials. She quickly became an important figure in MIT's pioneering Office of Design Services which was among the first in the nation to hire a designer (Muriel R. Cooper  now professor of visual studies at MIT's Media Laboratory) to represent it graphically. Ms. Casey remained with MIT until her death and was director of the Office of Design Services from 1972 to 1989 when she retired and became a visiting design scholar at the MIT Media Laboratory.Ms. Casey and Professor Cooper were students together at art school and became friends and colleagues. Professor Cooper was instrumental in bringing her to MIT."The spriit of MIT nurtured her work  and in turn her work nurtured the humanity of MIT " Professor Cooper said.The MIT Museum  which mounted the exhibit currently being shown at the Compton Gallery  also published a book on her work  "Posters  Jacqueline S. Casey: Thirty Years of Design at MIT."Joseph P. Ansell  chair of the Visual Arts Department at Otterbein College in Westerville  Ohio  in an appreciation of her work written for the book  said she created "some of the most elegant posters in America. . .  Her sense of proportion is at once precise and measured  organic and humane. These seemingly opposite qualities are clearly appropriate for her subjects and her audience. Most of her posters announce arts events at [the] MIT  an institution known primarily for teaching and research in science and technology. Yet  surprisingly  those posters for other events (scientific lectures and academic programs  for example) are equally imaginative  lively and personal. MIT is  first and foremost  an institution dedicated to learning in all its varied  humanistic facets. Through careful analysis  Casey uncovers the essence of each subject and communicates the creative spark which is the source of all ."Nicholas P. Negroponte  director of the MIT Media Laboratory  writing in the same book  recalled meeting her when he was an 18-year-old sophomore at MIT."We had lunch together almost every day for four years. During that time I loitered in the offices of Design Services where I learned all I know about graphic design. I learned how a design could be at once Swiss in its cleanness  Italian in its imagination  and playful like Jackie herself. . . Jackie always says she cannot teach. Ha! She doesn't need to. She has already taught thousands of young designers through her work. . . Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Jackie did nothing but learn from her insights. She captures the essence of a design program in less time than it takes most of us to understand its constituent parts. What is most extraordinary is that she does all of this with profound humor  which  in my mind  is what separates great from good design."Ms. Casey was born in Quincy  Mass.  on April 20  1927  and received a certificate in fashion design and illustration and a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Massachusetts College of Art in 19___49. She then worked in fashion illustration  advertising  interior decorating and trade publications before joining MIT in 1955.Her work has been exhibited in one-woman shows at the MIT Hayden Corridor Gallery (1972  1979  1983  1984)   Chelsea School of Art  London  (1978)  MIT Burton House Gallery (1979)  London College of Printing (1980)  MIT Museum (1985)  the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art  New York  (1989)  and Massart's Massart  Boston  (1989).  Ms. Casey's work was also represented in many group exhibitions in this country and abroad  including Images of Survival: The 40th Anniversary of the Bombing of Hiroshima  which was shown in Japan and other countries.She was a guest lecturer at many museums and schools  including the Massachusetts College of Art  Yale University  Carnegie-Mellon University  Cooper Union and Kent State and had been a judge of several national exhibitions.Examples of her work have been acquired for permanent collection by the Museum of Modern Art  New York  the Cooper-Hewitt Museum  New York  the USIA  and the Library of Congress. Her work is also represented in many graphic design magazines and annuals and in books on the history of graphic designShe was the recipient of the William J. Gunn  Award in 1988 given by the Creative Club of Boston. She received an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1990. She was appointed by the late President Bartlett A. Giamatti of Yale to the Visiting Committee of the Yale School of Graphic Design. She was a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale and of the American Institute of Graphic Arts.Ms. Casey was married to William Casey who died in 1975. She is survived by an aunt  Phyllis Keane of Lowell; two uncles  Stanley Kingston of Hull and Richard Ronan of Plymouth; and a cousin  Kevin Keane of Brookline.A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10am Friday  May 22 at St. Columbkille's Church  325 Market St. Brighton.

Professor B.L. Averbach Dies,Professor Benjamin L. Averbach  a materials scientist and engineer whose research and teaching ranged from steel to shellfish  died Wednesday  April 1  in his sleep at his home in Belmont after a long struggle with cancer. He was 73.Dr. Averbach  an emeritus professor since July 1990  joined MIT in 1945 as a research assistant in what then was called the Department of Metallurgy  now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. He received the ScD degree from MIT in 1947. His BS and MS in metallurgy were from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy  N.Y.Before joining the MIT faculty he was a metallurgist for General Electric Co. and chief metallurgist for US Radiator Corp.Professor Averbach published more than 200 papers on a variety of materials subjects  including transformations in steels  determinations of atomic arrangements in amorphous materials  developments of analytical techniques in X-ray  electron and neutron diffraction  and fracture phenomena in ships  pipelines and aircraft.For many years he was a leading researcher in a national effort that involved the MIT Sea Grant Program to develop uses for chitin and chitosan  the natural polymers derived from the shells of lobsters  crabs and shellfish. He succeeded in turning this substance into a transparent film which is edible  biodegradable and quite strong. The film had applications as a food wrap and surgical dressing.An active and highly respected consultant with industry  he was involved in the development of new materials with high-fracture toughness for bearings used in high-speed aircraft engines and gears and in advances in magnetic and optical recording.Professor Averbach was a fellow of the American Society for Metals and of the Institute of Metals. He was a member of the Metallurgical Society and of the American Physical Society. He was past president of the International Congress on Fracture and a delegate to the International Institute of Welding.Among his awards was the Howe Medal of the American Society for Metals  awarded in 1949 to Professor Averbach and two others for a prize-winning paper.Professor Averbach  a resident of Belmont for 40 years  is survived by his wife Gertrude; a son  Paul of New York City; two daughters  Anne Mott of Lexington and Clare Averbach of Hartford; two grandchildren; and two brothers  Philip of New York and Harold Averbach of California.Contributions in his memory may be made to the Growth and Development Fund of St. Joseph's Church  345 Waverley St.  Belmont.A version of this

Professor John C. Sheehan Dies at 76,Professor Emeritus John C. Sheehan  whose chemical synthesis of penicillin at MIT in 1957 led to the development of many tailor-made forms of the drug  died Saturday of congestive heart failure at his home in Key Biscayne  Fla. He was 76.Dr. Sheehan's synthesis of the lifesaving antibiotic opened the way to the development of particular penicillins to combat particular bacteria. He held about 30 patents and among his inventions was Ampicillin  a commonly used semi-synthetic penicillin taken orally rather than by injection.The synthesis of penicillin solved one of the most baffling problems of modern chemistry. Penicillin-discovered in 1928 by Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming-was desperately needed during World War II  but the natural mold process took months to make a relatively small amount of the miracle drug. During the war  about 1 000 scientists in 39 laboratories in the United States and Great Britain spent about $20 million in a frantic but unsuccessful attempt to synthesize penicillin. After that effort failed  many organic chemists concluded it was impossible.Eventually  improved fermentation technology led to highly effective procedures for the commercial production of natural penicillin.Dr. Sheehan  who joined the MIT faculty in 1946  began working on the synthesis of penicillin in 1948. He worked for nine years on the penicillin molecule  aided financially by Bristol Laboratories of Syracuse  N.Y. Medical research was conducted by Merck  Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories at Rahway  N.J. Dr. Sheehan described the penicillin molecule as unstable. It disintegrates easily  and constructing it in the laboratory  he said  was like "placing an anvil on top of a house of cards."In achieving total synthesis  Dr. Sheehan also produced an intermediate compound in the form of a basic penicillin nucleus. By stringing various chemicals into the nucleus  he was able to produce new types of pencillin for specific uses. Other researchers built on this work to turn out hundreds of kinds of synthetic penicillin.Harvard Professor of Chemistry E.J. Corey  a Nobel laureate  paid tribute to his mentor at MIT as "a very conscientious and very effective teacher. He is the undisputed pioneer in the field of penicillin chemistry after World War II. He had a vision and the ability to see important problems and to focus on them." Corey won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1990 for the development of the theory and methodology of chemical synthesis  "all of which started with John and his MIT colleagues many years ago " Corey said.One of Dr. Sheehan's closest MIT colleagues  George H. Buchi  professor of chemistry  emeritus  said that the first total synthesis of a penicillin was made possible by "John Sheehan's brilliant planning and the meticulously high quality of his work." Although it "remains Dr. Sheehan's most significant scientific achievement " he added  it was only one element in an "astonishing career."Dr. Bucchi paid tribute to the "elegance" of Dr. Sheehan's work in synthesizing penicillin and added  "the knowledge gained in the course of the MIT total synthesis allowed Sheehan  and later on others in the pharmaceutical industry  to prepare medicinally more effective penicillin with side chains different from those available by fermentation.""These studies also led him to broaden the methodology of amide forming reactions " Professor Buchi said  "and culminated in what was soon termed the `carbodiimide' method in peptide synthesis.""In addition to these achievements  which were recognized by many honors " he added  "Sheehan tackled successfully a number of difficult structural problems in the area of natural product chemistry."Professor Sheehan's professional awards include the American Chemical Society (ACS) Award in Pure Chemistry in 1951  and the ACS Award for Creative Work in Pure Chemistry in 1959. In 1964  the City of Philadelphia  crediting him with "saving millions of lives " gave him the John Scott Award and Medal for inventors benefitting mankind.Born in Battle Creek  Mich.  on Sept. 23  1915  John Clark Sheehan graduated from Battle Creek College in 1937 and received his master's and PhD degrees in organic chemistry from the University of Michigan in 1938 and 1941  respectively. In 1941  he co-developed with the late Professor W.E. Bachmann of the University of Michigan a large-scale method for manufacturing the militarily important high explosive RDX  or cyclonite. He was a senior research chemist at Merck & Co. in Rahway  N.J.  from 1941 to 1946.In 1946  he began a 31-year teaching career at MIT as an assistant professor of chemistry. He was promoted to associate professor in 1949 and to professor of organic chemistry in 1952. He became professor of organic chemistry emeritus and senior lecturer in 1977. Besides his work on penicillin  he also did research in amino acids  peptides  alkaloids  steroids and the synthesis of high explosives. In 1982  MIT Press published his book  The Enchanted Ring: The Untold Story of Penicillin. He was the author of more than 150 scientific publications.He was a scientific adviser to Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson from 1961 through 1965  serving on a number of presidential advisory committees. He served as scientific liaison officer with the American Embassy in London for the Office of Naval Research in 1953-54.He held honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame and Stevens Institute of Technology. He was a Fellow of the Chemical Society/Royal Institute of Chemistry in London  and a member of the National Academy of Sciences  the American Chemical Society  the American Institute of Chemists and the New York Academy of Arts and Sciences.He is survived by his wife of more than 50 years  the former Marion M. Jennings; a brother  David Sheehan of Battle Creek  Mich; three children  John C. Jr. of Denver  Colo.; David E. of Key Biscayne  and Elizabeth S. Watkins of Saunderstown  R.I.  and six grandchildren.Funeral services were private.A version of this

Professor H.C. Willett Dies,Dr. Hurd C. Willett  an MIT meteorologist renowned for his role in developing five-day weather forecasting techniques and widely known for his attempts at very-long-range forecasting  died March 26 at a West Concord nursing home. He was 89.A memorial service was held March 30 in Littleton  where he had lived since 1949.Professor Willett  who joined the MIT staff in March 1929  specialized in climatic fluctuations  variable solar influences and long-range weather forecasting. In the 1930s  he was instrumental in the development and adoption of the polar front theory of five-day weather prediction by the Weather Bureau. Later  starting in the late 1950s  he focused his research on discovering the basic patterns he felt exist behind weather conditions.He developed a theory that climatic conditions on earth follow a cyclical pattern which will become clearer as statistical records extend over longer periods of time. To back up his theory  he did exhaustive surveys of weather conditions going back to prehistoric times.His long-range forecasting caught the attention of the press to such an extent that in his obituary  the Boston Globe referred to him as a meteorologist "who was prepared to forecast the weather for tomorrow as well as for 10 000 years from now." For several years the wire services regularly carried his annual predictions of what the weather would be over the next 12 months.He was born in Providence  R.I. on January 1  1903  grew up near Pittsburgh and earned a bachelor of science degree at Princeton in 1924 and a doctorate in meteorology from George Washington University in 1929. During World War II he trained meteorologists for the military and served as a consultant at air bases in Europe and Canada. In 1951 he received a plaque from the American Meteorological Society for outstanding service.He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  the American Meteorological Society  the Royal Meteorological Society  the Association of American Geographers  the American Geophysical Union  the AAAS  Sigma Xi  and Phi Beta Kappa.He is survived by his wife  the former Dorothy Lloyd; three sons  Dr. Allen B. of Denver  Dr. Stephen C. of Berkeley  Calif.  and David Hurd of Littleton; two daughters  Joyce Willett Bradley of Vancouver and Emily Willett Ranck of Hopkinton; a brother  Edward F. of Bridgeport  Conn; and seven grandchildren.A version of this

Whitehead Founder Dies,Edwin C. (Jack) Whitehead  founder of the MIT-affiliated Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and a Life Member of the MIT Corporation  died Sunday  Feb. 2  after suffering a heart attack during a squash game. He was 72 and lived in Greenwich  Conn.A memorial service is planned for 3pm Thursday  Feb. 13  at the New York Academy of Medicine  2 East 103d Street  New York City  and in Cambridge at a date to be announced.Remembrances may be made be The Jack Whitehead Memorial Fund through the Whitehead Institute.Mr. Whitehead  a noted businessman  had a distinguished career in science  industry  medicine and philanthropy.He was a co-founder in 1939  with his father  of Technicon Corporation  a pioneer in scientific and clinical instrumentation. What began in a one-room office in the Bronx grew over the next 40 years into a $450 million international corporation whose innovative products and technologies played a key role in creating the modern clinical diagnostics industry.After the company's sale in 1980 in a stock and cash exchange in excess of $400 million  Mr. Whitehead fulfilled one of his lifetime goals with the founding of the Whitehead Institute  a nonprofit  independent basic research and teaching institution affiliated with MIT in its teaching activities but responsible for its own facilities and finances.The affiliation was forged in 1982  with Mr. Whitehead providing $35 million to build the research facility in Kendall Square  adjacent to the MIT campus  and establishing a trust fund to provide annual operating expenses into perpetuity  for a total of about $135 million. It stands as the largest single gift ever made to American science and one of the largest made for any purpose  according to the Institute.Dr. David Baltimore  an MIT professor of biology and Nobel laureate who helped develop the plan for the Whitehead Institute and its affiliation with MIT  was recruited as its founding director.In its short history  the Institute has become one of the world's most prestigious and productive basic biological research institutes.Today the Whitehead Institute houses approximately 320 scientists divided among 20 laboratories. Fifteen of the laboratories are under the direction of members or associate members  all of whom hold joint appointments on the MIT faculty in the Department of Biology; the other five laboratories are directed by Whitehead Institute Fellows. In addition  the Institute provides educational and research opportunities for about 65 graduate students  mostly from MIT  and some 40 undergraduates supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. There are also postdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists from throughout the world.At his death  Mr. Whitehead was chairman of Whitehead/Sterling  a private investment and asset management company in Stamford  Conn.Although he had no official role at the Whitehead Institute  he visited often  took pleasure in the scientific achievements and worked with its board of trustees and administration.Dr. Gerald Fink  the Institute's director  said that Mr. Whitehead's "vitality and enthusiasm for science were part of the spirit of the Whitehead Institute. He was a great philanthropist  but he gave us much more than his financial support. He took great joy in our achievements and was a constant source of encouragement. He envisioned a future in which biomedical science would contribute to the betterment of all human beings."Mr. Whitehead  who held almost 20 patents covering fields from tissue processing to automated blood analysis  was the first and only non-PhD/MD to receive the Van Slyke award from the American Association of Clinical Chemists for his contributions to clinical chemistry and laboratory diagnostics.He was a trustee and director of a number of foundations  organizations and universities.He was elected a Life Member of the MIT Corporation in 1989 and served on the visiting committees for the Departments of Biology and Mechanical Engineering and the Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology.MIT Chairman Paul E. Gray  who was MIT president at the time of the affiliation with Whitehead  said  "In his creation of the Whitehead Institute  Mr. Whitehead made a great and lasting contribution to the life sciences. The entire scientific community  and MIT particularly  are stronger because of his foresight and generosity."Mr. Whitehead is survived by his three children  Susan of Wellesley  Mass.  Peter of New York City and John of Dunwoody  Ga.  and by numerous stepchildren and grandchildren.A version of this

Professor H.M. Stommel Dies,Henry M. Stommel  a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and former professor of oceanography at MIT who gained worldwide recognition for his work on the large-scale circulation of oceans  died January 17 at the New England Deaconess Hospital of a heart attack after surgery for a liver tumor. He was 71 and lived in the Woods Hole section of Falmouth. A memorial service was held January 22 in St. Barnabas Church  Falmouth.Professor Stommel was at Woods Hole for many years before going first to Harvard University as a professor of oceanography in 1960 and then to MIT in 1963 in what was at that time the Department of Meteorology.He stayed at MIT for 15 years  contributing importantly to the Institute's rapidly developing program of education and research in the earth sciences  before returning to Woods Hole in 1978.Although he never earned an advanced degree  Professor Stommel was recognized as one of the most imaginative  productive and influential oceanographers in the world."His originality and the range and penetration of his own research have in major part generated the modern concepts of ocean circulation " said James R. Luyten  chairman of the department of physical oceanography at Woods Hole.He made outstanding contributions to the scientific knowledge of interaction between oceans and the atmosphere  to the theory of cumulus clouds and to the distribution of such variables as temperature and humidity over the sea.It was in the 1950s  The New York Times said  that he became known internationally for his speculation on circulation in the Atlantic. "He recognized the role of the earth's rotation in pushing the Gulf Stream westward along the coast of North America and also proposed that its northward flow must be balanced by a deep southward flow beneath it " the Times said. "He proposed a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the far north  feeding the deep south-flowing current  whereas water rises in the Antarctic  supplying a northward flow along the east coast of the Americas."Much of this theory was later confirmed  the Times said.Born in Wilmington  Del.  Professor Stommel was educated in physics at Yale University  receiving the BS degree in 1942.

Services Held for Beckley,Services were held Friday  Jan. 3  in the First Congregational Church of Winchester for Lawrence E. Beckley  an MIT alumnus and executive officer of MIT's Center for Space Research until his retirement in 1978.Mr. Beckley died December 30 at Youville Hospital  Cambridge. He was 75 and lived in Winchester.He received the SB in aeronautical engineering in 1942 and served as a Navy officer in Washington  administering research contracts  during World War II.Returning to MIT in 1946  Mr. Beckley held various administrative and management positions with the Aerolastic Research Laboratory  Instrumentation Laboratory and Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics before helping establish the Center for Space Research in 1963.Some of Mr. Beckley's contributions to the center were enumerated at the funeral service in a eulogy by Joseph H. Binsack  associate director."Larry Beckley  Jack Harrington of the Lincoln Laboratory and a small handful of others were the original promoters of a Center for Space Research at MIT " he said. "NASA asked MIT to form the center in 1963 and Larry served as its first administrative officer. . . responsible for all the personnel  proposals  property and physical space requirements for the fledging organization and its first projects."During its first years  the center was responsible for administering several millions of dollars to sponsor seed research in the space science and engineering fields. Many of these took root and became the mainstay of not only MIT's but also the nation's involvement in future space research projects."Mr. Binsack said that Mr. Beckley also had a major role in the design and construction of the center's new building between 1966 and 1968. In 1973 he was appointed the center`s assistant director  Mr. Binsack said  "in recognition of its growing needs and Larry's role in guiding it."Mr. Beckley was not a scientist  Mr. Binsack said  but his background in engineering "enabled him to understand the work of scientists and engineers  to see their needs and expectations. His expertise was to find the best way to achieve them within the administrative bureaucracies of government and MIT."Mr. Beckley served on the Winchester School Committee in the 1960s. His interests included carving birds of basswood  leading Explorer Scouts on canoe trips to Moosehead Lake in Maine and hunting with bow and arrow.He leaves his wife  Ruth (Manuel); four daughters  Marilyn E. of Syracuse  N.Y.  Ruth McDowell of Winchester  Nancy of Arlington and Susan Burns of Chatham  N.Y.; a brother  William J. of New Jersey; a sister  Elizabeth Link of New Mexico; and seven grandchildren.A version of this

Merrie G. Klapp Succumbs to Cancer,Professor Merrie G. Klapp  whose intellectual interests spanned the fields of architecture  mechanical engineering  semiotics  communications  environmental policy and political science  died December 9 of brain cancer. Professor Klapp  41  was a research affiliate and former associate professor in urban studies and planning."I remember Merrie for her mind that posed probing questions  for her work that bridged different academic disciplines  for her great interest in those around her  and for her enormous courage " said Professor Peter J. Katzenstein of Cornell University  who edited one of her books.A native of San Diego  Professor Klapp received the bachelor's degree in architecture from Stanford University in 1971  having studied also at the University of Beirut and Vassar College. She completed her MS degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford in 1973.During this time she traveled to Italy where she met Professor Umberto Eco  the renowned semiotician and author with whom she collaborated on a semiotic approach to intercultural communication in Europe. Their work produced several articles including one on a new notion of "territoriality" in the social meaning attributed to urban space.Enrolling for doctoral study at the University of California at Berkeley in 1974  Professor Klapp was inspired by political science professor Ernst Haas to direct her interest to an analysis of international organizations. She traveled around the world in 1978 collecting data on the Law of the Sea and completed her PhD in 1980 under Professor Haas and Professors Melvin Webber and Michael Teitz of UC's Department of City and Regional Planning.In 1981-82 Professor Klapp was a research fellow at both the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and MIT's Center for International Studies. She was appointed assistant professor of urban studies and planning in 1982 and became associate professor in 1989.Initially her research at MIT focused on the role of government in natural resources policy  resulting in several articles and the book The Sovereign Entrepreneur  published as part of the Cornell Series in Political Economy edited by Professor Katzenstein  Walter S. Carpenter Jr. Professor of International Studies.Later at the direction of her department she turned her attention to the political aspects of environmental policy and  even while struggling with cancer  produced numerous articles and the book  Bargaining with Uncertainty  to be published this month by Auburn House Press of the Greenwood Publishing Group.Last year as a research scholar at the Institute for International Studies at Berkeley Professor Klapp began research for a book on the Italian textile industry  to introduce regional  as opposed to national  governments as a critical element in international industrial theory. Despite her illness she made three trips to Italy and conducted more than 60 interviews for the book. She left an outline of her proposal but the book itself was never written.Professor Klapp is survived by her husband  Professor Sy D. Friedman of mathematics at MIT; her parents  Professor Emeritus Orrin E. Klapp and Evelyn G. Klapp of San Diego  and a brother  Curtis Klapp of Seoul  Korea.
